# Gang Raids

This section gives details about Gang Raid scenarios.

:::info Designer's Notes: Using Gang Raid Scenarios

The scenarios presented here are intended to make for quick games, perhaps played over a lunch break, or to allow several, smaller games to be played in an evening. In campaign play, these scenarios are perfect for gangs who have several fighters in Recovery or for players wishing to strike at their opponents without risking their whole gang, allowing your gang to grow even when severely depleted.

If both players agree, the winner of a pre-game roll can choose to play one of these scenarios. Players can also agree between themselves to play one of these scenarios instead of rolling-off in the pre-game sequence. In an Arbitrated campaign, the Arbitrator may decide that one of these scenarios should be used at any given time if one player is particularly disadvantaged due to injuries.

When a gang leader orders an attack on a rival, it's invariably part of a bigger picture, their goals ranking from taking turf to killing a valuable target. Sometimes, this can be achieved with just a handful of fighters, a small crack team sent out to do a job better to keep quiet. Neither is every conflict a well-planned operation, as at times small groups of gangers will stumble across an opportunity that's just too good to miss. Whether shaking down an ammo stall or just roughing up some local thug-lord who looked at them wrong, such conflicts are isolated instances involving only a few members of a gang. Often, these are fights committed to on a whim, the victors returning to the gang afterwards to brag about their actions while the defeated slink away in shame. Regardless of the results, these small battles create quite the stir whenever they occur.

### Terrain

The Gand Raids scenarios have been written with Zone Mortalis very much in mind, allowing players to fit games into a relatively small set of terrain which is convenient to transport.

These secenarios are short and to the point, but can be played on any terrain.

## Gang Raid Special Rules

Due to the relatively small size of Gang Raids scenarios the following rules apply to them, in addition to any special rules listied in the scenario.

### Bottle tests

To make a Bottle test during a Gang Raids scenario, the player rolls a D3 instead of a D6 before adding the result of the total number of fighters that are Seriously Injured or Out of Action.

### Beneath My Notice

It is rare for a leader to lead small scale operations, instead giving these tasks to their most trusted champions. Whether minor affairs requiring a measure of stealth or nothing more than outbreaks of spontanious violence, these skirmishes are rarely anything more than a handful of gangers on each side.

To represent this, the following restrictions apply when a player is choosing their crews for Gang Raid scenarios:

- The player may not include a Leader as part of their Crew.
- The player may only include one Champion as part of their Crew.
- The player may not include any Hangers-on, Brutes or Hired Guns as part of their crew.

### A Minor Affair

Gang Raids scenarios are small conflicts far removed from the larger conflict between gangs over territory and business. As such, Territory and Rackets cannot be staked on a Gang Raids scenarios - delivering a blow to their opponent's pride is enough of a reward here.

### Deployment

Deployment in Gang Raids scenarios following the standard deployment rules. The exception is that fighters may not make use of the [Infiltrate](/docs/gang-fighters-and-their-weaponry/skills/#4-infiltrate) skill during Gang Raids scenarios. If a fighter has the Infiltrate skill, they deploy like any other fighter unless stated otherwise.

### Loot Caskets

Unless otherwise states, no Loot caskets are placed upon the battlefield during Gang Raids scenarios.
