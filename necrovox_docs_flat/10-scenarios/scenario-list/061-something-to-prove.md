# 61. Something to Prove

_A newly-minted gang must learn fast or die!_

**Source: House of Chains**

## Attacker & Defender

Tie-breaker for determining the attacker:

1. Lowest rating.
2. Roll-off (the winner can choose attacker/defender).

The other gang is the defender.

## Battlefield

Standard.

## Crews

- **Attacker:** Custom (D3+7).
- **Defender:** Random (D3+7).

## Tactics Cards

- Custom (2).
- Underdog (starting crew cost): +1 random per 100 credits.

## Deployment

Standard.

## Giant Killers

_The underdog got something to prove, hoping to bloody the nose of a stronger gang and not get too smashed about in the process._

The attacker receives bonuses depending on the difference in gang rating (all are cumulative):

0-100:

- Does not need to make Bottle tests.

101-250:

- The Leader can ignore the effects of Flesh Wounds.
- From the second round and onwards, at least one action must be Shoot or Fight. If neither actions can be made, the Leader can only take a single action during the activation.

251-500:

- Fighters can re-roll one Injury dice when injuring enemy fighters.
- When making Recovery tests, the an extra Injury dice must be rolled, apply Out of Action if any dice rolled this result.

500+:

- Automatically pass any Cool tests.

## Ending the Battle

The battle ends when only one gang has fighters remaining.

## Victory

The last remaining gang is the winner.

## Rewards

#### Credits

- +D6x10 to the attacker per defender taken Out of Action.
- +D3x10 to the defender (if winning) per fighter still on the battlefield.

#### Experience

Scenario specific rewards:

- +1 for taking part.
- +1 to each defending (winning) fighter still on the battlefield.

Standard rewards:

- +1 for taking an enemy Out of Action.
- +1 for taking an enemy Leader or Champion Out of Action.
- +1 for killing an enemy (during the battle).
- +1 for Rallying.

#### Reputation

- -1 to any gang that bottled out.
