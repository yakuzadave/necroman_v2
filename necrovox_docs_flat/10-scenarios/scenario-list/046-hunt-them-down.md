# 46. Hunt Them Down

_Run for your lives!_

**Source: Book of Ruin**

## Attacker & Defender

The gang who chose this scenario is the attacker, the other is the defender. Otherwise, randomize one gang to choose who to be attacker and defender.

## Battlefield

Standard. Additionally, set up the battlefield using 2x3 tiles. Fighters should be able to traverse the battlefield from one short edge to the other.

## Crews

- **Attacker:** Custom, see Relentless Hunters.
- **Defender:** Random (D3+3).

## Tactics Cards

- Custom (2).
- Underdog (starting crew cost): +1 random per 100 credits.

## Deployment

1. **Defender:** Base contact with one of the short battlefield edges.
2. **Attacker:** No deployment at the start.

## Freedom Road

_The defenders have been discovered trying to sneak through the attacker’s turf and now must make an escape._

- **Defender’s deployment edge:** Trailing edge.
- **Opposite short edge:** Leading edge.

In each End phase, if there are defenders within 2” of the Leading edge, remove the 2 tiles closest to the Trailing edge. Fighters on the removed tiles are removed:

- **Attacker:** Returned to the Relentless Hunters.
- **Defender:** Out of Action, suffer a Lasting Injury roll.

The attacker then places 2 tiles in contact with the Leading edge (effectively extending the battlefield). The battlefield must at all times be 2x3 tiles and it must be possible to traverse the battlefield between the 2 short edges.

The attacker can set up doors and terrain on these tiles. The short edge next to the removed tiles is the new Trailing edge. The short edge on the added tiles is the new Leading edge.

## Relentless Hunters

_The attackers have discovered enemies in their territory and are going to make them pay!_

At the start of the 2nd round, and each subsequent round, the attackers can deploy a wave of fighters from the crew:

- **First wave:** Custom (D3+3)
- **Subsequent waves:** Custom (D3)

Deployed the attackers in any of the following ways:

- **Any wave:** On the Trailing edge.
- **Subsequent waves:** Any edge, within 8” of an already deployed attacker.

Attackers can't be deployed within 1” of any defender.

Deployed attackers becomes Ready like normal.

## Ending the Battle

The battle ends when at least one of the following is true:

- Only one gang has fighters remaining (at the start of a round).
- The end of round 9.

## Victory

The attacker wins if there are no defenders left on the battlefield at the end of any round. Otherwise the defenders win.

## Rewards

#### Experience

Scenario specific rewards:

- +1 for taking part.
- **Attacker:** +1 per defender Out of Action.
- **Defender:** +1 if on the battlefield at the end.

Standard rewards:

- +1 for taking an enemy Out of Action.
- +1 for taking an enemy Leader or Champion Out of Action.
- +1 for killing an enemy (during the battle).
- +1 for Rallying.

#### Reputation

- +D3 for winning.

:::danger House Rule (Necrodamus)

**Problem:** Infiltrate can be imbalanced or break this scenario.

**Solution:** If at least one player wants, Infiltrate can't be used in this scenario. Instead, Infiltrating fighters can make 1 or 2 move actions before the first round.
