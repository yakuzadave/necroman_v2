## Drunken Heroes

_A small group of fighters attempt to defend a beloved drinking hole from attackers. The vat of Wild Snake must be protected at all costs! Luckily the defenders are drunk on Wild Snake making them shrug off damage._

Defenders gain the following:

- When wounded, roll 5+ to not lose the wound.
- Cannot be Pinned.
- Automatically pass Cool checks.

## Save The Wild Snake

Attackers can destroy the vat of Wild Snake by making a successful melee attack against it.

## Reinforcements

- 2 fighters per gang.
- Each End phase (starting on the 2nd round).

:::danger Ambigious content
The scenario is contractory here whether the defender should have reinforcements (but they probably shouldn't). The scenario reads:

> The attacker can use Reinforcements, as described in the Battlefield Set-up & Scenarios section of the Necromunda Rulebook. In the second round, and each round thereafter, up to two random fighters from each gang will arrive in the End phase on a random battlefield edge.

## Shootout At The Lucky Six

If players wish, they may use this scenario to
represent the defence of the Lucky Six by the Merdena sisters.

In order to do this, make the following changes:

- The defender uses [Margo Merdena](/docs/gangs/gang-additions/hired-guns/agents/#margo-merdena-orlock), and three [Orlock Road Captains](/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-orlock/#road-captain-leader) to represent Mindi, Vivian and Vespa Merdena.
- The attacker uses a Goliath gang.
- The Merdena sisters ignore any wound taken on a 3+ instead of a 5+.
