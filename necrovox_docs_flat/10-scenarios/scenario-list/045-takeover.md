## Surprise Assault

_The attacker is making a prepared assault against the enemy territory to capture a number of key points - or landmarks - to take control of the local area._

#### Landmarks

The battle ends when at least one of the following is true:

- Only one gang has fighters remaining (at the start of a round).
