_Gangs fight to survive a rapidly growing jungle._

**Source: Book of Peril**

## Battlefield

Standard.

## Crews

Custom (10).

## Tactics Cards

- Custom (2).
- Underdog (starting crew cost): +1 random per 100 credits.

## Deployment

Standard.

## Special Rule: Growing Horror

The battlefield is rapidly becoming overgrown by a fungal horror, and with each round, the Carnivorous Plant spreads.

At the start of the battle, place a marker on the centre of the board (for Zone Mortalis, choose the central-most tile). This represents the fungal horror. The area within 12” (or the tile) of the marker is overgrown with writhing questing vines.

- Fighters beginning or ending the activation in this area gains the Blaze condition (counts as being coated in flesh-eating spores).
- Fighters may take no more than 1 Move action (unless equipped with a respirator).
- Seriously Injured fighters go Out of Action.
- Line of sight in this area is limited to 6” (clouds of spores).

In each End phase, the player with Priority rolls a D6 for each Fungal Horror marker. On a 4+, place a new marker 12” in a random direction from it (or the closest tile in a random direction). If this point is off the board, place the marker on the edge instead.

## Ending the Battle

The battle ends when at least 1 condition is true:

- Only one gang has fighters remaining (at the end of a round).
- 9+ Fungal Horror markers on the battlefield (at the start of any End phase).

## Victory

The remaining gang is the winner. Otherwise it is a draw.
