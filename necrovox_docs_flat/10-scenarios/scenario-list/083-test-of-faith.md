# 83. Test of Faith

_A gang tests the faith of its newest members._

**Source: House of Faith**

:::info Designer's Note: Bringing Faith to the Faithless

While the scenarios provided here have been designed for House Cawdor gangs, there is no reason that, with the permission of the Arbitrator, they might not be
used for any gang.

Test of Faith lends itself well to multi-player games â€“ where
multiple gangs gather to test the strength of their newest members or even a
gathering of Cawdor gangs fight each other to weed out the weakest believers
among them. By contrast, Righteous Crusade can be used to represent any gang
that has been charged with clearing out an area of the underhive, whether in the
name of some unseen master, or perhaps in the employ of the Guilds, a criminal
syndicate or some other underhive power.

## Attacker & Defender

Tie-breaker for determining the attacker:

1. Cawdor.
2. Lowest rating.
3. Roll-off (the winner can choose attacker/defender).

The other gang is the defender.

## Battlefield

Standard.

## Crews

Custom (10).

## Tactics Cards

- Custom (2).
- Underdog (starting crew cost): +1 random per 100 credits

## Deployment

Standard.

## The Unworthy

_A gang tests the faith of its newest members._

Declare 3 Unworthy fighters from the attacking crew:

- The 3 cheapest fighters (credit cost).
- Not Leader or Champion.

## Trials Of Faith

_The Unworthy must prove themselves during the battle._

There are 6 trials that can be completed by the Unworthy:

1. Perform a Coup de Grace (against an enemy).
1. Recover from being Seriously Injured.
1. Inflict a wound on an enemy Leader or Champion.
1. Take down an enemy Psyker (Seriously Injure or Out of Action).
1. Take down an enemy Brute (Seriously Injure or Out of Action).
1. Survive being ablaze for 3 consecutive rounds.

Each trial can be completed multiple times.

## Ending the Battle

The battle ends when any of the following are true:

- Only one gang remains on the battlefield.
- All Unworthy are removed from the battlefield.
- Completing 6 trials.

## Victory

The attacker wins if completing 6 trials. Otherwise the defender wins.

## Rewards

#### Experience

Scenario specific rewards:

- +1 for taking part.
- +D3 to each Unworthy completing at least 1 trial.

Standard rewards:

- +1 for taking an enemy Out of Action.
- +1 for taking an enemy Leader or Champion Out of Action.
- +1 for killing an enemy (during the battle).
- +1 for Rallying.

#### Reputation

- +D3 to the winner.
- +D3+1 to the attacker if completing each individual trial (6 different).
- -1 for bottling out.

:::danger House Rule (Necrodamus)

This scenario is broken. The defender can almost always win by voluntarily failing the Bottle test, then fleeing the battlefield, preventing the Unworthy from completing more trials.

Solution: The attacker wins if the defender voluntarily bottles out OR flees the battlefield voluntarily.
