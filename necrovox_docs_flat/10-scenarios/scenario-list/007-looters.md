# 7. Looters

_A gang launches an all-out attack on a rival’s turf in the hope of raiding their stash._

_Source: Necromunda 2018 Rulebook_  

## Attacker & Defender

The gang who chose this scenario is the attacker, the other is the defender. Otherwise, randomize one gang to choose who to be attacker and defender.

## Battlefield

Standard. Any type (2D, 3D, Ash Wastes).

## Crews

- **Attacker:** Custom (10) (Ash Wastes: can include vehicles).
- **Defender:** Random (D3+4) + Reinforcements (Ash Wastes: Reinforcements can include vehicles).

## Home Turf Advantage

Defender:

- **Bottle tests:** Roll 2D6 and discard the highest.
- **Rally tests:** +1.
- **Hangers-on:** Included in the crew on a 4+ (roll individually).

## Tactics Cards

- Attacker: Custom (2).
- Defender: Random (2).
- Underdog (starting crew cost): +1 random per 100 credits.

## Deployment

1. Defender:

   - 4 loot caskets (anywhere).
   - Entire crew (within 3" of any loot casket).

2. Attacker: Pick a battlefield edge to be the escape route. Set up the entire crew within 6” of that edge

:::danger House Rule (Necrodamus)
The objective is completely unrealistic. Having one gang march across the board, into or through the enemy gang, pick up loot caskets and then carry them all the way back is completely unrealistic! Either the attackers will suffer casualties and eventually flee, or the opponent will suffer casualties and eventually flee, at which point the defender receives 100% of the rewards (no secured loot caskets). Apply this fix:

Defender and attacker deploy on opposite edges according to standard deployment rules. Then deploy loot caskets within 2” of the middle line between both deployment zones, at least 6” from another loot casket.
:::

## Claiming Caskets and Escaping

The attackers are attempting to secure the 4 loot caskets and move them off via the escape route. The caskets are valuable even if opened or converted to ammo caches - however, if the ammo cache is exhausted it can't be claimed by the attacker. Note that only those 4 loot caskets placed by the defender can be claimed by the attacker.

Any of the 4 loot caskets (or ammo caches) can be claimed if within 1” of the escape route at the start of an End phase (removed from the battlefield). Attackers within 1” of the escape route can escape at the start of an End phase (even if Seriously Injured). They count as being Out of Action for the purposes of Bottle tests.

Attackers cannot claim loot after bottling out, but can still escape.

## Reinforcements

- Defender: X (where X is the round number).
- Start of each End Phase.

## Fleeing the Battlefield

If the defender voluntarily bottles out and flees the battlefield, the attacker automatically wins the scenario and may claim all of the loot caskets.

## Ending the Battle

The battle ends if max one gang has models remaining on the battlefield (at the end of any round).

## Victory

The attacker wins by claiming more loot than there are left on the battlefield. Otherwise the defender wins.

## Rewards

#### Credits

- **Attacker:** D3x10 per claimed loot, taken from the defender's Stash (note that the attacker can't take more than the defender has).

#### Experience

Scenario specific rewards:

- +1 for taking part.
- +1 to the attacking Leader if at least 2 loot caskets were claimed (regardless of whether they took part in the battle or not).

Standard rewards:

- +1 for taking an enemy Out of Action.
- +1 for taking an enemy Leader or Champion Out of Action.
- +1 for killing an enemy (during the battle).
- +1 for Rallying.

#### Reputation

- **Attacker:**
  - +1 per claimed loot.
  - -2 if no loot was claimed.
- **Defender:**
  - +1 per unclaimed loot.
  - -2 if all loot were claimed.
  - +1 to both gangs if this was the first battle against each other.
