# 104. Desperate Raid

**Source: White Dwarf, May 2022**

:::info Underdog Scenario

This scenario is designed for an underdog gang to have a high-risk/high-reward opportunity against a considerably stronger enemy:

- At least 400 less Gang Rating than the enemy.
- Can be chosen if the underdog gets to choose the scenario (when rolling to determine which scenario is played).
- Underdog tactics cannot be used in this scenario.

:::

## Attacker & Defender

The underdog is the attacker, the other gang is the defender.

## Battlefield

## Deployment

2. **Defender:** Anywhere at least 12 from enemies.

## Tactics Cards

None.

## Break For Home

The attacker has Priority in the 1st round.

## Ill-Gotten Gains

_The underdogs have managed to sneak into the heart of the enemy territory and seize a large cache of goods that can be sold for a tidy profit._

In each End phase, attackers within 1" of any battlefield edge are removed (securing any loot that is B2B).

If no defenders remain on the battlefield, the attackers secure all remaining loot.
