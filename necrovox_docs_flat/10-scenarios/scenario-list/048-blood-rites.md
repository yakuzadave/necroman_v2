# 48. Blood Rites

_A dark offering for the gods._

**Source: Book of Ruin**

## Attacker & Defender

If only one gang is Chaotic, then that gang is the attacker. Otherwise, the gang who chose this scenario is the attacker, the other is the defender.

## Battlefield

Standard.

## Crews

- **Attacker:** Custom (10)
- **Defender:** Random (D3+3) + Reinforcement

## Tactics Cards

- Custom (2).
- Underdog (starting crew cost): +1 random per 100 credits.

## Deployment

Standard.

## Reinforcements

- Defender: 1.
- Each End phase (starting on the 2nd round).

## Sacrifices

_The attacker is seeking to stain the ground with a blood offering._

Defending fighters taken Out of Action are not removed from the battlefield. Instead the fighter becomes a ‘downed fighter’:

- Apply a Lasting Injury as normal.
- Still considered Out of Action (no longer becomes Ready).
- Can't make any actions for any reason.

Other fighters can spend a double action to drag a downed fighter up to a single Movement distance.

Attacking fighters B2B with a downed fighter can spend a double action (Blood Ritual) to gain a Blood token. The fighter must immediately pass a Toughness test, or be removed.

## Ending the Battle

The battle ends when at least 1 condition is true:

- Only one gang has fighters remaining (at the start of a round).
- The end of round 9.

## Victory

The attacker wins if having 5+ Blood tokens when the battle ends, or being the last remaining gang. Otherwise the defender wins.

## Rewards

#### Experience

Scenario specific rewards:

- +1 for taking part.
- **Attacker:** +1 per Blood token gained.

Standard rewards:

- +1 for taking an enemy Out of Action.
- +1 for taking an enemy Leader or Champion Out of Action.
- +1 for killing an enemy (during the battle).
- +1 for Rallying.

#### Reputation

- +D3 for winning.
- -1 to any gang that bottled out.
