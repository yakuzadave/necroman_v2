## Looting the Battlefield

Gangs are out for loot and steal anything that’s not nailed down - and some things that are!

A fighter within 1” of a loot can make a Loot (Double) action to see if it contains anything useful. Roll a D6:

| D6  | Result                                                                    |
| :-: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
|  1  | Booby trap! Explodes like a frag trap: Str 3, D 1, Blast (5”), Knockback. |
| 2-3 | Nothing.                                                                  |
| 4+  | 1 loot point.                                                             |

Regardless of the result, the loot is removed from the battlefield.
