# 105. Data-Purge

**Source: White Dwarf, May 2022**

:::info Underdog Scenario

This scenario is designed for an underdog gang to have a high-risk/high-reward opportunity against a considerably stronger enemy:

- At least 400 less Gang Rating than the enemy.
- Can be chosen if the underdog gets to choose the scenario (when rolling to determine which scenario is played).
- Underdog tactics cannot be used in this scenario.

:::

## Attacker & Defender

The underdog is the defender, the other gang is the attacker.

## Battlefield

Standard.

## Crews

Custom.

## Deployment

Standard with the following exceptions:

- Before deployment, the defender places 3 objective markers (binaric cogitator):
  - At least 6" from any battlefield edge.
  - At least 8" from other objectives.

## Tactics Cards

None.

## Binaric Cogitators

_The underdog has been hired to prevent other gangs from interfering with data-purging of some binaric cogitators. The attacking gang will try to halt the data-purge subroutines to preserve the data core._

Attackers can spend a Basic action (Hack Cogitator) within 1" of an objective: Pass an Intelligence test to remove it from the battlefield.
