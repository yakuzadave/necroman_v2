## Battle Type

This scenario is an Ash Wastes battle; vehicles and
wargear that grant the Mounted condition can be
included in either gangâ€™s starting crew.

## Battlefield

This scenario uses the standard rules for setting up
a battlefield, as described in the [Battlefield Set-up & Scenarios section](/docs/battlefield-setup/battlefield-set-up).

## Crews

This scenario uses the standard rules for choosing a
crew, as described in the [Scenario Rules: Choose Crew section](/docs/battlefield-setup/scenario-rules). Both gangs use the Custom
Selection (D3+7) method to determine their crew.

## Deployment

This scenario uses the standard rules for deployment
as described in [Scenario Rules: Gang Tactics](/docs/battlefield-setup/scenario-rules#gang-tactics).

## Gang Tactics

This scenario uses the standard rules for gang tactics
as described in [Scenario Rules: Gang Tactics](/docs/battlefield-setup/scenario-rules#gang-tactics).

## Ending The Battle

If either gang has no models left on the battlefield or
there are no more fuel caches on the battlefield at the
end of any round, the battle ends immediately.

## Victory

The side who gathered the most Fuel points is the winner.

## Rewards

#### Credits

Each gang adds D3x10 credits to their Stash for each
fuel point they have.

#### Experience

Each fighter that gained a fuel point earns 1 XP.

#### Reputation

The victorious gang gains D3 Reputation.

If either gang bottled out, they lose 1 Reputation.

## Looting The Battlefield

The gangs are hunting for fuel caches and will loot any that they find! Roll 2D6 to
determine the number of fuel caches, these can be represented by Loot caskets,
barrels, consoles or any other small pieces of terrain. Players then take turns placing
these objects on the battlefield, starting with the player who has Priority. Fuel caches
must be at least 6" from a battlefield edge, and at least 3" from a battlefield object.

A fighter within 1" of a fuel cache can make a Loot (Double) action to see if it
contains anything useful:

**Loot (Double):** Roll a D6. On a 4, 5 or 6, the fighter finds some fuel and their
gang gains 1 Fuel point. On a 1, the fuel explodes like a frag trap (see page 269).
Regardless of the result of the roll, once a fuel cache has been interacted with,
remove it from the battlefield.

## Running Low On Fuel

The vehicles of both gangs are running on vapours. Each time a vehicle is activated,
before it performs any action roll a D6. On a roll of 1, the vehicle changes its Status
to Stationary and Stalled as the engine stutters.

## Fleeing The Battlefield

If either gang voluntarily bottles out and subsequently flees the battlefield, their
opponent automatically wins the scenario.
