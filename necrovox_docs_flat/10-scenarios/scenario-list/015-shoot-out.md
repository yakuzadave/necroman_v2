## Battle Type

This scenario is an Underhive battle; vehicles and
Wargear that grant the Mounted condition cannot be
included in either gang’s starting crew.

## Battlefield

The battlefield for this scenario represents a long
tunnel, settlement main street or narrow gantry.
This scenario uses the standard rules for setting up
a battlefield, as described in the [Battlefield Set-up & Scenarios section](/docs/battlefield-setup/battlefield-set-up). The table size
should be roughly 36" long and 12" wide, with no
terrain that blocks line of sight from one short end to
the other.

## Crews

This scenario uses the standard rules for choosing a
crew, as described in the [Scenario Rules: Choose Crew section](/docs/battlefield-setup/scenario-rules). Both gangs use the Hybrid
Selection (1+D3) method to determine their crew.

## Deployment

Players roll off to see who deploys first, placing all of
their fighters 10" from one short edge of the battlefield,
on ground level and within 1" of at least one other
friendly fighter. Both crews should have line of sight to
each other.

## Gang Tactics

Neither side uses gang tactics for this scenario.

## Ending The Battle

If either gang has no fighters left on the battlefield at
the end of any round, the battle ends immediately.

## Victory

A gang is the winner if it is the only one with any
fighters left on the battlefield at the end of the battle.

## Rewards

#### Credits

The victorious gang adds D6x5 credits to their
Stash for each enemy fighter taken Out of Action,
representing the pockets of fallen foes being
rifled through.

#### Experience

Any fighter that didn’t fail a Cool test before the
shooting started earns an additional 1 XP.

#### Reputation

Each gang gains 1 Reputation.

The gang that drew second (i.e., did not fail six Cool
tests) gains a number of Reputation equal to the
difference between the number of Cool tests they
failed and six (for example, a gang that failed three
Cool tests would gain 3 Reputation).

## Quick Draw

Fighters are considered to have their weapons
holstered or stowed as they stalk toward their
adversaries, both sides waiting to see who will
draw first.

When a fighter activates, make a Cool test for them
– if they fail, place a marker on their Fighter card to
represent their nerve starting to crack (the number of
failed Cool tests can also be represented by a dice).
As soon as one crew has failed a total of six Cool tests,
they go for their guns (see below)!

Until one side draws and starts shooting, the only
action a fighter may take during their activation is
a single Move (Simple) action. This move must be
taken toward the opposing crew, may be no more than
3", and may not take the fighter into cover. If their
movement would take a fighter closer than 4" to an
enemy fighter, they take no action instead.

When a crew’s fighters go for their guns, all fighters
on the board become Ready, then each player makes
an Initiative test for each of their fighters – adding
+1 if they are using a weapon with the Sidearm trait
and subtracting -2 if they are using a weapon with the
Unwieldy trait. Fighters that passed the test activate in
order of their Initiative, from lowest to highest.

Those that are tied go at the same time (for example,
I 2+ goes first, followed by I 3+, etc). Then, those
that failed the test activate in order of their Initiative
characteristic, from lowest to highest. Those that
are tied go at the same time. For fighters activating
simultaneously, players should work out any
Shoot (Basic) actions before any Move (Simple) or
Charge (Double) actions. Once the quick draw has
been worked out, the following rounds are played
as normal.

## Arbitrating The Scenario

The Arbitrator can use this scenario to represent
a Bounty Hunter having a showdown with their
prey. In a one on one game, the Arbitrator takes
the place of one of the players, creating a Bounty
Hunter and two Hive Scum to accompany them,
and selecting one of their opponent’s crew as
the fighter the Bounty Hunter is there to kill.
In a multi-player game, the Arbitrator takes one
Bounty Hunter and two Hive Scum for every
gang they are facing, and chooses a fighter from
each opposing crew to be the target of all the
Bounty Hunters.

<h2>Battlefield</h2>

The battlefield for this scenario represents a long tunnel, settlement main street or narrow gantry. For Zone Mortalis, use 3 tiles to create a straight corridor, with a clear line of sight from one side to the other. For Sector Mechanicus, the table size should be roughly 36”x12” with no terrain that blocks line of sight from one short end to the other.

<h2>Crews</h2>

- Random (D3+1).

<h2>Tactics Cards</h2>

- None.

<h2>Deployment</h2>

Roll-off to see who deploys the crew first:

- On ground level
- Within 10” of a short board edge
- Within 1” of at least one other friendly fighter
  Both crews should have line of sight to each other.

<h2>Special Rule: Quick Draw</h2>

When a fighter activates, make a Cool test for them - as soon as one crew has failed a total of 6 Cool tests, they go for their guns!

Until one side draws and starts shooting, fighters can only make a single move action during activations:

- No more than 3”.
- Must move toward the opposing crew.
- May not move into cover.
- If the move would take the fighter closer than 4” to an enemy fighter, take no action instead.

When a crew’s fighters go for their guns, all fighters on the board become Ready. Make an Initiative test for all fighters, adding +1 if using a Sidearm and a -2 modifier if using an Unwieldy weapon.

- Fighters that passed the test activate first (first group).
- Those that failed the test activate last (second group).

Activations in the first and last groups are made in order of their Initiative characteristic, from best to worst.

For fighters activating simultaneously (tied go at the same time), work out any Shooting actions before any Move or Charge actions.

Once the quick draw has been worked out, the following rounds are played as normal.

<h2>Ending the Battle</h2>

The battle ends when only one gang has fighters remaining.

<h2>Victory</h2>

The winner is the last gang with fighters on the battlefield.

<h2>Rewards</h2>

#### Credits

- +D6x5 to the winning gang per enemy fighter taken Out of Action.

#### Experience

Scenario specific rewards:

- +1 for taking part.
- +1 to each fighter that didn’t fail a Cool test before the shooting started.

Standard rewards:

- +1 for taking an enemy Out of Action.
- +1 for taking an enemy Leader or Champion Out of Action.
- +1 for killing an enemy (during the battle).
- +1 for Rallying.

#### Reputation

- +1 to each gang that took part in the battle.
- 6 minus the amount of failed Cool tests to the gang that didn’t fail all 6 Cool tests.
