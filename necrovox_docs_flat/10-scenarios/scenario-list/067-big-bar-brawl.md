# 67. Big Bar Brawl

_A drunken insult leads to a free-for-all in the local drinking hole._

**Source: House of Iron**

:::info Designer's Note: Challenge Accepted!

While the scenarios presented here have been designed specifically for House
Orlock gangs, there is no reason that, with the permission of the Arbitrator, they
might not be used for any gang.

Both scenarios also lend themselves well to
multi-player scenarios – such as the Big Bar Brawl where multiple gangs punch
it out in a drunken free-for-all in the middle of some underhive drinking hole. Alternatively, Road Block can make for an interesting Arbitrated battle, with
the Arbitrator taking control of the road blocks and one or more gangs trying to
break through to the other side of the battlefield, or even with a gang in charge
of each road block as part of an uneasy alliance, their fighters under attack by
the forces of the Arbitrator.

:::

## Battlefield

Standard.

## Crews

- Random (7).

## Tactics Cards

None.

## Deployment

Randomize one gang to place the first, then take turns placing all remaining fighters:

- Within 12” of the centre of the battlefield.
- At least 1” from another fighter.

## Drinking Hole

_The fighters are all relaxing in a local drinking hole and are not armed for a gang fight. A drunken insult leads to a free-for-all._

All fighters count as being unarmed and unarmoured:

- Can't make attacks with any equipped weapons.
- No save from armour or field armour.
- Can't use any carried Wargear.

Skills work as normal (including special saves or improved fighting abilities).

The Action phase is replaced by the following new phases:

- Drinking phase (starts after determining priority).
- Fighting phase.

In both phases, take turns activating fighters, starting with the gang with priority as normal. The activation order resets between the 2 phases, so the gang with priority will activate first in both phases.

#### Drinking Phase

A fighter (including Seriously Injured) can choose one of the following:

- Drink: Gain an intoxicated token.
- Stagger: Move D6” (any direction).

After all fighters have either drunk or staggered, this phase ends.

#### Fighting Phase

Each fighter can make a single Simple, Basic or Double action. No fighter can take more than a single action each round, regardless of any special rules or skills.

Charge (Double) action: Move D6” (instead of D3+M).

Each intoxicated token give the following effect:

- +1T.
- -1 hit modifier when attacking (a 6 will always hit).

#### End Phase

After all fighters have activated, move on to the End phase.

Apply the following to all Engaged fighters:

- Move 1” apart (directly away from each other).
- Pass an Initiative test with a -1 modifier per intoxicated token or become Pinned.

## Ending the Battle

The battle ends when only one gang has Standing fighters remaining at the end of any End phase.

## Victory

The gang with at least 1 Standing fighter at the end of the battle is the winner.

## Rewards

#### Credits

- D3x10 to the winner.

#### Experience

Scenario specific rewards:

- +1 for taking part.
- +1 to each fighter still Standing with 4+ intoxicated tokens.

Standard rewards:

- +1 for taking an enemy Out of Action.
- +1 for taking an enemy Leader or Champion Out of Action.
- +1 for killing an enemy (during the battle).
- +1 for Rallying.

#### Reputation

- +1 for winning.
