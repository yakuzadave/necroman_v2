# 80. Defile the Relic

_A gang that really wants to make itself known may raid deep into an enemy's territory, hoping to steal goods and defile something sacred._

**Source: Hive War Rulebook 2021**

## Attacker & Defender

The winner of a roll-off chooses whether to be the attacker or defender.

## Battlefield

20"x16" as shown (each square is approximately 2"x2").

The relic is placed at the centre.

`R` = Gang Relic

## Crews

- **Attacker:** Random (5) + Reinforcements.
- **Defender:** Random (5 sentries) + Reinforcements.

## Reinforcements

- D3 per gang.
- Start of each round (after the alarm is raised and earliest at round 2).

## Home Turf Advantage

Defender:

- Bottle tests: Roll 2D6 and discard the highest.
- Rally tests: +1.

## Tactics Cards

- Draw 2, keep 1.

## Deployment

1. **Defender:** Green.
2. **Attacker:** Red.

## Gang Relics

The attacker is trying to defile a gang relic, but the defenders are aware and have guards defending it.

- +2 for any Cool and Leadership tests made by friendly fighters within 6” of the gang relic (while undefiled).

#### Defiling A Relic

_If the relic is left unprotected, the enemy will try to wreck it, tear it down, mark it with their own gang's tag or ruin it in a more creative fashion!_

Spend a Double action within 1” to wreck
the relic. It no longers offers any bonuses
and can't be wrecked again.

## Ending the Battle

The battle ends if any of the following are true:

- Only one gang has fighters remaining on the battlefield.
- End of the 6th round.

## Victory

The attacker wins if the relic is defiled and at least 1 attacking fighter (not Seriously Injured) is on the battlefield.

The defender wins if the relic is not defiled and at least 1 defending fighter (not Seriously Injured) is on the battlefield.

Otherwise it's a draw.
