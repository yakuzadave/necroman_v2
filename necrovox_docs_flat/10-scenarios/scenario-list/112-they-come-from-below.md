# 112. They Come From Below!

_“The Lord of Skin and Sinew demands all shall feast today! Go forth and drown the world in their own bloated organs!”_  
\- Felkormog, Harvest Lord of the Lodge of Tearing Hands

In this scenario, wave after wave of attackers swarm up from the depths while the defenders fight them back.

## Attacker & Defender

The gang who chose this scenario is the attacker, the other is the defender. Otherwise, randomize one gang to choose who to be attacker and defender.

## Battlefield

Standard (Ash Wastes or Sector Mechanicus) with the following exception:
Place a Blast (5") in the centre of the battlefield to act as a pit which waves of attackers pour out of.

## Crews

- **Attacker:** 3 waves of Random (D3+1).
- **Defender:** Random (6).

If the attacker has insufficient models to fill each wave, ensure the first waves are filled first.

If playing an Ash Wastes battlefield, vehicles and mounts can be included.

## Tactics Cards

- Custom (2).
- **Underdog** (starting crew cost): +1 random per 100 credits.

## Deployment

1. **Defender:** Within 6" of the Gunk Tank.
2. **Attacker:** Anywhere at least 6" from the defender's deployment zone.

## Home Turf Advantage

Defender:

- **Bottle tests:** Roll 2D6 and discard the highest.
- **Rally tests:** +1.
- **Hangers-on:** Included in the crew on a 4+ (roll individually).

## From The Pit

_Wave after wave of attackers swarm up from the depths while the defenders fight them back._

New waves arrive in the End phase of the following rounds:

- 2nd wave: Round 3.
- 3rd wave: Round 6.

The next wave can also arrive in an earlier End phase if the current attacking wave has no models left on the battlefield.

All models in a wave are deployed B2B with the pit as normal.

## Fleeing The Battlefield

If one gang voluntarily bottles out and subsequently flees the battlefield, the opponent automatically wins the scenario.

## Ending the Battle

The battle ends when only one gang remains at the start of a round.

## Victory

The last remaining gang is the winner. Otherwise it is a draw.

## Rewards

#### Credits

- Winner: 2D6x10.
- Loser: D6x5.
- Draw: D6x10.

#### Experience

Scenario specific rewards:

- +1 for taking part.
- +D3 to the winning Leader (regardless of whether they took part in the battle or not).

Standard rewards:

- +1 for taking an enemy Out of Action.
- +1 for taking an enemy Leader or Champion Out of Action.
- +1 for killing an enemy (during the battle).
- +1 for Rallying.

#### Reputation

- +D3 (win).
- -1 (bottle out).

:::info Narrative Variant

## The Defence Of Dust Falls

If players wish they may use this scenario to
represent the defence of Dust Falls, as a tide of
Chaos worshippers and corrupted gangs attack from the Abyss. An alliance of criminals, guilders and gangs must hold the Abyss without turning on each other.

In order to do this, make the following changes:

- The defender must include at least one delegation with the Criminal Allies rule and at least one with the Law-abiding Allies rule (see [Alliances](/docs/gangs/gang-additions/alliances)).
- The attacker takes three gangs, each roughly the same Gang Rating as the defender’s force; these are the three waves of assailants that emerge from the Abyss.
- The Strange Bedfellows rule is in effect (see below).

#### Strange Bedfellows

Each time a model from a delegation makes a ranged attack, if there is a model from a different
delegation within 9" they must make a Leadership check. If the check is passed, they may attack
normally; if the check is failed then they must target
a model from the other delegation.
