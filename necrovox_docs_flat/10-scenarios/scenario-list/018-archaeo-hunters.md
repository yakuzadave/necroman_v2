# 18. Archeo-hunters

_Gangs fight over ancient technology deep in the underhive._

**Source: Gang War 3**

## Battlefield

Standard.

## Crews

- Random (D3+7).

## Tactics Cards

- Custom (2).
- Underdog (starting crew cost): +1 random per 100 credits.

## Deployment

Standard.

## Objectives

The gangs are trying to crack open the vault before their rivals.

## Special Rule: The Automata

Gangs are hunting for a rumoured archaeo-vault, but to find it, and crack it open, they need to use an abandoned mining automata. After setting up the board, randomly select one of the edges that is not part of a deployment area. Place a door on this edge, as close to the midpoint as possible. This is the entrance to the vault. Next, place a marker or suitable model in the centre of the battlefield to represent the automata.

**Wargear:** [Light Carapace (4+)](/docs/armoury/armour#carapace).  
**Special rule:** The automata can't be Pinned.

</FighterCard>

The automata begins the battle in a powered-down state. A fighter can perform the Power Up (Simple) action to power it up:

:::info Power Up (Simple)
If within 1” of the automata, pass an Intelligence test to power it up. The automata becomes ready and is part of the gang who powered it up until it powers down.
:::

In the end phase, the automata returns to a powered-down state.

Only the automata can open the vault. It can perform the Destroy Door (Double) action:

:::Info Destroy Door (Simple)
If the automata is powered up and within 1” of the vault door, the vault door is destroyed.
:::

After the vault door is destroyed, any fighters may move off the table and into the vault via the doorway.

## Fleeing the Battlefield

If a gang voluntarily bottles out and flees the battlefield, their opponent automatically wins. The winner gains an additional D6x10 credits for each of their fighters that are still on the battlefield and not Seriously Injured.

## Ending the Battle

The battle ends when only one gang has fighters remaining (whether having fled, been taken Out of Action or entered the vault).

## Victory

The gang with the most fighters in the vault is the winner. Otherwise it is a draw.

## Rewards

#### Credits

- D6x10 per fighter in the vault.
- D6x10 per fighter still on the battlefield (excluding Seriously Injured) if the opponent voluntarily bottled out and flees the battlefield.

#### Experience

Scenario specific rewards:

- +1 for taking part.
- +1 to each fighter entering the vault.
- +D3 for taking the automata Out of Action (if using alternative scenario rules).

Standard rewards:

- +1 for taking an enemy Out of Action.
- +1 for taking an enemy Leader or Champion Out of Action.
- +1 for killing an enemy (during the battle).
- +1 for Rallying.

#### Reputation

- +1 to each gang that took part in the battle.
- +D3 to the winning gang.

:::danger Alternative Rules
The Ambot is especially appropriate for this scenario and can be substituted for the automata.

More than one automata can be introduced to make the scenario more challenging. The Automata begins the scenario powered up, and fighters must move into base contact with them and make Intelligence tests to take control of them for a round. Unless controlled by a gang, each automata will fight on their own side to defend the vault.
