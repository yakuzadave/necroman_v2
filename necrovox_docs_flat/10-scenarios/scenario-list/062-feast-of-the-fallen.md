## Gods of the Underhive

_The gangs honour the hardest fighters to ever walk the underhive by attempting to beat one another to death. Acts of violence are offered to the legendary ancestors to empower the gangs, and when one does, it falls to the rivals to bring them down - for while becoming a god is glorious, killing one is even better! While something supernatural might be going on, it is just as likely homicidal hysteria._

Each time a fighter suffers a wound from a weapon with one of the traits listed below, the fighter becomes empowered on a 4+ (before rolling any Injury dice). If successful, no other fighters can make this test or become empowered.

If the fighter is empowered, any effects of the attack is cancelled.

The empowered fighter gains the following effects:
Immediately restore the Wounds to the starting number.
Can't be Pinned.
If Seriously Injured by a ranged attack (not Melee/Versatile), suffer a Flesh Wound instead.
Ignores all other Flesh Wounds.

In addition to the benefits above, apply the effects below depending the trait(s) of the weapon that inflicted the wound.

| ---------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Melee, Versatile | God of Blood  | Unarmed attacks become Damage 5.                                                |
| Blaze            | God of Fire   | Unarmed attacks gains Blaze, Immune to Blaze effects.                           |
| Gas, Toxin       | God of Poison | Unarmed attacks gain Toxin.                                                     |
| Shock            | God of Pain   | Unarmed attacks gain Shock and Versatile (6”).                                  |
| Blast            | God of Fury   | Unarmed attacks gain Blast (3”), Ignores Blast effects (including own attacks). |
