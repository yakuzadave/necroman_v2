# 139. Settlement Raid (Ash Wastes)

_Source: Necromunda 2023 Rulebook_

_“To the east barricade, Nomads attacking!”_  
\- Dillan ‘Eyes’ Rico, Lookout in defence of Ash City

In this scenario, one gang attacks the other gang while it is shaking down a settlement for credits and resources.

## Attacker And Defender

In this scenario, one gang is the attacker and the other
is the defender. If this scenario is being played as part
of a campaign, then the gang that issued the challenge
is the attacker; otherwise, roll off with the winner
deciding whether they will attack or defend.

## Battle Type

This scenario is an Ash Wastes battle; vehicles
and wargear that grant the Mounted condition can
be included in either gang’s starting crew and the
defender’s Reinforcements.

## Battlefield

This scenario uses the standard rules for setting up
a battlefield, as described in the [Battlefield Set-up & Scenarios section](/docs/battlefield-setup/battlefield-set-up). The battlefield should
be set up to represent the middle of the wastes with a
settlement in one half of the table.

## Crews

This scenario uses the standard rules for choosing a
crew, as described in the [Scenario Rules: Choose Crew section](/docs/battlefield-setup/scenario-rules). The attacker uses the Custom
Selection (6) method. The defender uses the Hybrid
Selection (2+D3) method. The rest of the defending
gang’s Fighter and Vehicle cards are shuffled together
to form the Reinforcements decks.

## Deployment

The defender sets up their crew anywhere in the half
of the battlefield with the settlement in. The attacker
then sets up their crew within 6" of the opposite
battlefield edge.

## Gang Tactics

This scenario uses the standard rules for gang tactics
as described in [Scenario Rules: Gang Tactics](/docs/battlefield-setup/scenario-rules#gang-tactics).

## Ending The Battle

If either gang has no models left on the battlefield at
the end of any round, the battle ends immediately.

## Victory

If one gang has scored more points than the other at
the end of the battle, they are victorious. If both gangs
have scored the same number of points, the battle
ends in a draw.

## Rewards

#### Credits

The winning gang adds D6x10 credits to their Stash.
The losing gang adds D3x5 credits to their Stash.
In the case of a draw, both gangs add D3x10 credits to
their Stash.

#### Experience

The Leader of the victorious gang earns an additional
1 XP (regardless of whether they took part in the battle
or not).

#### Reputation

The winning gang gains 2 Reputation.

## Home Turf Advantage

The defender has the Home Turf Advantage as described in [Scenario Rules: Gang Tactics](/docs/battlefield-setup/scenario-rules#gang-tactics).

## Raiding Party

Each gang scores one point for each enemy fighter
that goes Out of Action and two points for each vehicle
that is Wrecked. In addition, the attackers have a
special objective, determined by rolling a D3 on the
table below:

| D3  | Result                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| :-: | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  1  | **Bushwhack:** The attacker scores one additional point for each enemy Champion taken Out of Action, and two additional points if the enemy Leader is taken Out of Action.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|  2  | **Scrag:** After deployment, the attacker nominates one enemy fighter in the enemy’s starting crew. If this fighter is taken Out of Action, the attacker scores one extra point, two if the enemy fighter was taken out by a Coup De Grace (Simple) action.                                                                                                                               |
|  3  | **Mayhem:** Once an attacking model has seriously injured an enemy fighter or Wrecked an enemy vehicle, the attacking model can leave the battlefield – if they end an action within 1" of their edge of the battlefield, they are removed from play and the attacker scores one point. The model counts as being Out of Action or Wrecked from now on for the purposes of Bottle checks. |

If the attackers bottle out, they cannot score any more
points for the above objectives.

## Desperation

In this battle, the defenders automatically pass any
Bottle checks. The defender may still voluntarily
bottle out.

## Reinforcements

At the start of each End phase, each player rolls a D3
and receives that many Reinforcements.

## Fleeing The Battlefield

If either gang voluntarily bottles out and subsequently
flees the battlefield, their opponent automatically wins
the scenario.
