# 65. Back From the Dead

_A Death-maiden is born._

**Source: House of Blades**

:::info Designer's Note: Scrag 'Em All!

While the scenarios presented here have been designed specifically for House
Escher gangs, there is no reason that, with the permission of the Arbitrator, they
might not be used for any gang. 

The Khimerix Hunt can make for an interesting
Arbitrated battle, with the Arbitrator taking control of the Khimerix, or perhaps
multiple Khimerix, and having the hunters become the hunted. Back from the
Dead is intended to represent the creation of a Death-maiden, but could equally
represent any ganger abandoned by their comrades fighting to make it back to
their gang hideout.

## Attacker & Defender

Tie-breaker for determining the defender:

1. Escher.
2. Roll-off (the winner can choose attacker/defender).

## Battlefield

Standard.

## Crews

- Attacker: Random (1).
- Defender: Random (10) split into 2 groups:

  - Custom (5 sentries).
  - Custom (5 reinforcement).

  The defending crew is made up of 10 random fighters, then divided into 2 groups of 5 fighters. One group is deployed as Sentries, the other arrives later as Reinforcements.

## Tactics Cards

- **Attacker:** Custom (2) + Random (1).
  - Additional Random (1) if the attacking fighter is a Ganger or Juve (including Specialists).
- **Defender:** Custom (2).

## Deployment

1. Defender: Within 2” of any battlefield edge.
2. Attacker: Within 6” of the centre of the battlefield.
3. Take turns placing 6 corpse markers (starting with the attacker):
   - Anywhere within 12” of the centre.
   - At least 4” from each other.

## Reinforcements

- Defender: Up to 2.
- Each End phase (starting on the round the alarm is raised).

## Field Of Corpses

_The enemy gang are combing the area looking for survivors. This takes place in the aftermath of a battle and the battlefield is strewn with corpses of dead gangers._

During the battle, a fighter can spend a Basic action (Scavenge) to scavenge weapons from the corpse markers. Roll a D6:

| D6  | Result                         |
| --- | ------------------------------ |
| 1   | Fighting Knife.                         |
| 2   | Laspistol.                     |
| 3   | Stub gun (with dumdum rounds). |
| 4   | Shotgun (solid & scatter).     |
| 5   | Lasgun.                        |
| 6   | Bolt pistol.                   |

Once a corpse marker has been scavenged, it is removed.

#### Scavenged Weapons

- A fighter can only carry one at a time.
- If scavenging a new weapon, the old is discarded.
- Lost at the end of the battle.

## Dead On Arrival

_The newly-risen Death-maiden is only just now coming to her senses, and as time goes on she will become surer of herself, and more deadly._

In each round, the attacking fighter can take a number of activations equal to the current round number (can activate twice in the second round, 3 times in round 3 and so forth). The enemy will be able to activate a fighter in between as normal (before the attacking fighter can activate again). The activations still only has 2 actions as normal.

If the attacking fighter is Seriously Injured, the result is automatically a Flesh Wound in the Recovery phase (no need to roll).

## Ending the Battle

The battle ends when only one gang has fighters remaining.

## Victory

The last remaining gang is the winner. If no gangs remain, the defender wins.

## Rewards

#### Experience

Scenario specific rewards:

- +1 for taking part.
- +D3 to a defender for taking the attacking fighter Out of Action.
- +D3+1 to the attacking fighter if winning.

Standard rewards:

- +1 for taking an enemy Out of Action.
- +1 for taking an enemy Leader or Champion Out of Action.
- +1 for killing an enemy (during the battle).
- +1 for Rallying.

#### Reputation

- +D3 to the winner.

:::danger House Rule (Necrodamus)

- A fighter must be within 1” of a corpse marker to scavenge weapons from it.
