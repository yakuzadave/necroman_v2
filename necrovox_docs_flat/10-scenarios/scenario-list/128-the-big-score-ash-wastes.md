# 128. The Big Score (Ash Wastes)

_“Gun it Big Pete, they’re getting away!”_  
\- Vespa ‘Minx’ Merdena, Radlight Runners, House Orlock

In this scenario, one gang is attempting to stop some valuable cargo being delivered while their rivals protect it.

**Source: Apocrypha: Bullet Road Run**

## Attacker & Defender

The gang who chose this scenario is the attacker, the other is the defender. Otherwise, randomize one gang to choose who to be attacker and defender.

## Battlefield

Standard (Ash Wastes & Rolling Roads).

## Crews

- Custom (8).

Vehicles and mounts can be included.

## Tactics Cards

- Custom (2).
- **Underdog** (Gang Rating): +1 random per 100 credits.

## Deployment

1. Defender deploys the Prize in the centre.
2. Defender then deploys within 6" of the Prize.
3. Attacker deploys within 1" of the Trailing Edge of the Battlefield.

## Rolling Roads

This is a Rolling Roads scenario with open sides and
follows [all the rules for Rolling Roads](/docs/battlefield-setup/rolling-roads).

## The Prize

The defender must designate one of their vehicles
to be the Prize. If they have more than one vehicle
then it must be the most expensive vehicle they have
in their gang. This has no effect on the vehicle aside
from acting as an objective for the scenario.

## The Score

The Prize knows that if it leaves the protection of
its escorts it will not survive long. Unless it is the
only model from the defending gang left on the
battlefield, the Prize automatically passes any Cool
check it needs to make to avoid becoming Broken
or fleeing the battlefield (there is no need to roll
the dice).

## Ending the Battle

The battle ends if any of the following is true:

- Prize has either been Wrecked or is no longer on the battlefield.
- End of 6 rounds.

## Victory

If the Prize is either Wrecked or not on the battlefield
at the end of the battle, the attacker wins. Otherwise
the defender wins.

## Rewards

### Credits

- Winner: 4D6x10.

#### Experience

Scenario specific rewards:

- +1 for taking part.
- +1 for the Prize if it survives.
- +D3 XP for model who Wrecks the Prize.

Standard rewards:

- +1 for taking an enemy Out of Action.
- +1 for taking an enemy Leader or Champion Out of Action.
- +1 for killing an enemy (during the battle).
- +1 for Rallying.

#### Reputation

- +D3 (win).
- -1 (bottle out).

:::info Narrative Variant

## Bullet Road Run

If players wish, they may use this scenario to represent the battle as numerous gangs attempt to claim the Prize from Vespa ‘Minx’ Merdena.

In order to do this, make the following changes:

- The defending gang should be an Orlock gang and include Vespa ‘Minx’ Merdena.
- Instead of one attacking gang, up to three gangs can attack the Prize. When they are deployed they must be at least 1" away from any enemy models.
- The winning attacking gang is the one that causes the Prize to become Wrecked. If the Prize is Wrecked for any other reason or the Prize flees the battlefield, the battle is a draw.
