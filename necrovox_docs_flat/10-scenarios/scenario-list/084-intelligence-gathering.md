# 84. Intelligence Gathering

_A gang must stay alive long enough to get some vital info._

**Source: House of Shadow**

:::info Designer's Note: Bringing Faith to the Faithless

While the scenarios presented here have been designed specifically for House
Delaque gangs, there is no reason that, with the permission of the Arbitrator, they might not be used for any gang.

Cauldron of Lies lends itself well to
multi-player games â€“ where multiple gangs must fight in a chaotic free-for-all
as the very win conditions they are fighting for changes from round to round.

Intelligence Gathering is the perfect opportunity for a gang to test its skill, not
just measuring its strength by the size of its crew or the firepower it can muster, but by its ability to survive long enough without taking out the foe to get the info
it needs

## Attacker & Defender

Tie-breaker for determining the attacker:

1. Delaque.
2. Lowest rating.
3. Roll-off (the winner can choose attacker/defender).

The other gang is the defender.

## Battlefield

Standard.

## Crews

- **Attacker:** Custom (10).
- **Defender:** Random (10).

## Tactics Cards

- Custom (2).
- Underdog (starting crew cost): +1 random per 100 credits

## Deployment

1. **Defender:**
   - Divide the battlefield into 4 quarters.
   - Place at least 1 fighter in each quarter (unless having less than 4 fighters).
2. **Attacker:**
   - Within 2" of one battlefield edge and within 12" of at least one friendly fighter (if possible).

## Underhive Spies

_The attacker is attempting to place hidden recorders, vox traps and other spying devices in the enemy turf. This activity is secret and the killing is kept to a minimum._

Each attacker can spend a Double action (Plant Spying) if all the following are true:

- Within 6" of a corner or centre of the battlefield.
- No enemies have LOS to this fighter.

Note that to win, the attacker must have at least 1 spy device in each of the 5 locations (4 corners + 1 centre). Additional spy devices can be placed in the same location, but this has no effect on winning the battle.

## Ending the Battle

The battle ends when any of the following are true:

- Only one gang remains on the battlefield.
- All 5 spy devices are placed (1 in each centre and 1 in the centre).

## Victory

The attacker wins if all 5 spy devices are placed. The defender wins if the attacker voluntarily bottles out or if only the defender remains on the battlefield at the end of the battle. Otherwise it is a draw.

## Rewards

#### Credits

- 2D6x10 to the attacker for winning.
- D6x10 to the defender for winning

#### Experience

Scenario specific rewards:

- +1 for taking part.
- +1 to each attacker for placing 1+ spy devices.

Standard rewards:

- +1 for taking an enemy Out of Action.
- +1 for taking an enemy Leader or Champion Out of Action.
- +1 for killing an enemy (during the battle).
- +1 for Rallying.

#### Reputation

- +D3 to the attacker for winning.
- -1 for bottling out.

:::danger House Rule (Necrodamus)

This scenario is broken. The defender can always prevent the attacker from losing by voluntarily failing the Bottle test, then fleeing the battlefield, preventing the attacker from placing more spy devices.

Solution: The attacker wins if the defender voluntarily bottles out OR flees the battlefield voluntarily.
