:::

## Battlefield

- Standard: 1-2 tiles (1"x1" or 1"x2").

## Crews

- Custom (4).

## Tactics Cards

- None.

## Deployment

Take turns placing fighters anywhere on the battlefield at least 3” from another fighter (the winner of a roll-off can choose to deploy first or second).

Take turns placing D3+3 Hive Dwellers anywhere on the battlefield at least 1” from any fighters from any gangs (starting with the winner of a roll-off).

## A NIGHT OF REVELRY

_All fighters have consumed several rounds of drinks before trouble started, making them mean drunks indeed! Both sides are attempting to be the last standing._

- No Group Activations.
- All fighters suffer from the Intoxicated condition:
  - -1” M.
  - -1 WS.
  - -1 BS.
  - Automatically pass Cool tests.

The first time a fighter is activated each round, roll a D6 to shake off the Intoxication:

- Round 1: 6+.
- Round 2 and onwards: 4+.

## Check Your Guns At The Door

_Most sensible saloon owners enforce a ‘no-guns policy’, to avoid situations like these rapidly escalating._

The following weapons can't be used:

- Ranged.
- Grenades.
- Unwieldy close combat weapons.

Fighters without any usable weapons are assumed to be equipped with a maul (representing a bar stool, table leg or other improvised weapon) for this battle.

## Patrons (Optional)

This battle uses D3+3 Hive Dwellers (slightly modified for this battle).

<FighterCard>

### Hive Dwellers

|  M  | WS  | BS  |  S  |  T  |  W  |  I  |  A  | Ld  | Cl  | Wil | Int |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 5"  | 5+  | 5+  |  3  |  3  |  1  | 4+  |  1  | 7+  | 8+  | 9+  | 9+  |

#### Special Rules

Hivers are treated as fighters and use the normal rules for movement, stray shots, being Engaged and pinning. However, if reduced to 0 wounds, they are taken Out of Action without rolling any Injury dice.

Hive Dwellers do not activate normally and instead react to the actions of nearby fighters. Hive Dwellers are triggered by the following actions:

- A fighter making a Fight action within 3”.
- A fighter ends a Move action within 2”.

</FighterCard>

After working out the effects of the action that triggered the hiver, roll a D6 on the table that follows (roll separately for each hiver that is triggered).

| D6  | Result                                                                                                                                                                            |
| --- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1-2 | **“Oh yeah?”:** Picks up a piece of furniture and takes a single Shoot action at the nearest fighter (even if that fighter didn’t trigger this event). Resolved as BS 5+, S2, D1. |
| 3-4 | **“Ok, take it Easy Fella!”:** Take no action.                                                                                                                                    |
| 5-6 | **“I’m getting outta here!”:** Flee the building (removed from the battlefield).                                                                                                  |

Unless triggered, a Hive Dweller takes no action.

During the End phase, take turns moving the hivers. Roll the
Scatter dice for each one:
Hit: The player moves the hiver its full Move in a direction of their choice.
Otherwise: Make a full Move in the direction indicated (stopping if contacting terrain or coming within 1” of another model).
