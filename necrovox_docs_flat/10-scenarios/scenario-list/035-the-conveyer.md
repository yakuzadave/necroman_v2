# 35. The Conveyer

_A battle between gangs as they descend through the hive._

**Source: Book of Peril**

## Attacked & Defender

The gang who chose this scenario is the attacker, the other is the defender. Otherwise, randomize one gang to choose who to be attacker and defender.

## Battlefield

Defender chooses a tile or a piece of terrain roughly 12” in diameter and sets it up in the centre of the table. This is the platform.

The attacker then sets up the rest of the board around the platform.

Finally, the attacker places 4 loot caskets within 12” of the edges of the platform.

## Crews

Custom (10).

## Tactics Cards

- Custom (2).
- Underdog (starting crew cost): +1 random per 100 credits.

## Deployment

The defender deploys on the platform. The attacker deploys at least 16” from the platform.

## Special Rule: The Platform

In each End phase, the defender rolls a D6 to see if the platform moves, adding a cumulative +1 to the result for each turn the platform remained stationary. On a 6+, the platform moves.

When the platform moves, remove any tiles or terrain from the board with the exception of the platform. Fighters not on the platform are removed from the board and any conditions on them are removed. They do not count as having gone Out of Action. The attacker then sets up the table around the platform in any configuration they choose, placing 4 new loot caskets (as described above) and deploys the fighters that were removed within 12” of the platform.

## Special Rule: Changing Environments

Each time the platform moves, replace the current Environment with a new random Environment. If the Dome Collapse Event is generated, the Platform immediately moves (as detailed above). While the Shutdown Event is in play, do not test to see if the platform moves.

## Ending the Battle

The battle ends when at least 1 condition is true:

- No more defenders remaining.
- After round 9.

## Victory

The attacker wins if there are no more defenders. The defender wins if all 9 rounds are played.

## Rewards

#### Experience

Scenario specific rewards:

- +1 for taking part.
- +1 to attacking fighters on the platform when it moves.
- +1 to defending fighters on the platform at the end.

Standard rewards:

- +1 for taking an enemy Out of Action.
- +1 for taking an enemy Leader or Champion Out of Action.
- +1 for killing an enemy (during the battle).
- +1 for Rallying.

#### Reputation

- +D3 to the winning attacker.
- +D3 to the winning defender.
