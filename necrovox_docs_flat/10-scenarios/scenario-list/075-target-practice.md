**Source: White Dwarf, April 2021**

## Battlefield

Standard. Should include some large open areas and numerous long-range firing lines where possible.

## Crews

- Custom (5).

## Tactics Cards

- None.

## Deployment

Take turns (starting with the winner of a roll-off):

- Deploy the entire crew 6” from the centre of the battlefield, each fighter 2” within another.

An Ammo-jack is then placed between the gangs.

## Shoot Out

_
The gangs test their aim in an Ammo-jack’s bullet emporium._

At the start of each round, each gang place the targets (markers) for the enemy gang on the battlefield. Starting the gang with priority, place 3 enemy targets as follows:

- Within LOS and weapon range of at least 1 enemy fighter.

Targets:

- Can be attacked as fighter.
- Benefits from cover.
- Removed when hit.

Score the following cumulative points per target hit:

| Attribute                                | Score |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----- |
| Long range                               | 2     |
| Partial cover                            | 1     |
| Full Cover                               | 3     |
| More than 24” away                       | 4     |
| Per friendly fighter risking Stray Shots | 2     |

Record the points per gang and per individual fighter.

In each End phase, the gang with the highest points total can:

- Move the Ammo-jack anywhere on the battlefield.
- Count the Ammo-jack as a friendly fighter the next round.

If a fighter attacks an enemy fighter:

- The Ammo-jack is moved within 6” of the offending fighter and attacks the offending fighter.
