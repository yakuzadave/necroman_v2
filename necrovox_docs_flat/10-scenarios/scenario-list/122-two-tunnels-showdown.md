:::info Narrative Variant

## Twins of Two Tunnels

If players wish, they may use this scenario to
represent Axon Hammer’s attempt to destroy the
Gunk Tank at the heart of Two Tunnels.

In order
to do this, make the following changes:

- The attacker’s gang should be a Goliath gang including a [Propagandist](/docs/gangs/gang-additions/hangers-on-and-brutes/hangers-on/#0-1-propagandist) and [Axon Hammer](/docs/gangs/gang-additions/hired-guns/agents#axon-hammer) using the Irontree Reavers rules (additions to [Gene-Smithing](/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-goliath/#gene-smithing-options) noted on their respective entries).
- The defender’s gang should be an Underhive Outcast gang including an [Agitator](/docs/gangs/gang-additions/hangers-on-and-brutes/hangers-on/#0-1-agitator) and led by [Gaen](/docs/gangs/gang-additions/hired-guns/hive-scum#gaen-the-gunk-queen-gorvos) and [Vunder Gorvos](/docs/gangs/gang-additions/hired-guns/hive-scum#vunder-gorvos).
- The War of Words special rule is in effect (see [Propagandist](/docs/gangs/gang-additions/hangers-on-and-brutes/hangers-on/#0-1-propagandist)/[Agitator](/docs/gangs/gang-additions/hangers-on-and-brutes/hangers-on/#0-1-agitator) profiles).
