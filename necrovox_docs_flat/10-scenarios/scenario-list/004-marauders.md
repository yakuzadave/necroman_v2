# 4. The Marauders / Settlement Raid v2

_Starting a fight in an enemy’s territory takes guts. Winning it builds a gang’s reputation!_

_Source: Necromunda 2018 Rulebook_  

## Attacker & Defender

The gang who chose this scenario is the attacker, the other is the defender. Otherwise, randomize one gang to choose who to be attacker and defender.

## Battlefield

- **Marauders (2d):** Standard (6 tiles).
- **Settlement Raid v2 (Ash Wastes):** Standard, one half should be the wastes, the other half should be a settlement.

## Crews

- **Attacker:** Custom (6) (Ash Wastes: Vehicles can be included\_.
- **Defender:** Random (D3+2) + Reinforcements (Ash Wastes: Vehicles can be included as Reinforcements).

## Home Turf Advantage

Defender:

- **Bottle tests:** Roll 2D6 and discard the highest.
- **Rally tests:** +1.
- **Hangers-on:** Included in the crew on a 4+ (roll individually).

## Desperation

**Defenders:** Automatically pass any Bottle tests (can still bottle out voluntarily).

## Tactics Cards

- Custom (2).
- Underdog (starting crew cost): +1 random per 100 credits.

## Deployment

- Marauders (2d): Standard.
- Settlement Raid v2 (Ash Wastes):
  1.  Defender: Entire crew in the settlement half.
  1.  Attacker: With 6" of the opposite edge (wastes).

## Objectives

Each gang scores points:

- 1 point per enemy fighter Out of Action.
- 2 points per enemy vehicle Out of Action (wrecked).
- D3 points for being the last gang on the battlefield.

The attacker has a special objective granting additional points, roll a D3:

1. Bushwack:

   - +1 point per enemy Champion Out of Action.
   - +2 points if the enemy Leader is Out of Action.

2. Scrag: After deployment, nominate 1 fighter in the enemy's crew to be the target.

   - +1 point if the target is Out of Action.
   - +1 point for Coup de Grace against the target.

3. Mayhem: After an attacker has Seriously Injured an enemy, the attacker can leave the battlefield by ending an action within 1" of their edge. The attacker counts as Out of Action for the purposes of Bottle tests.

   - +1 point if the attacker leaves.

If the attacker bottles out, points can no longer be scored from these objectives.

## Reinforcements

- Defender: D3.
- Start of each End phase.
- Within 1" of any battlefield edge and at least 12" from enemies (deployed by the controlling gang).

## Ending the Battle

The battle ends (at the end of any round) if max one gang remains on the battlefield.

## Victory

The gang that scored the most points is the winner. Otherwise it is a draw.

## Rewards

#### Credits

- D6x10 (win).
- D3x5 (lose).
- D3x10 (draw).

#### Experience

Scenario specific rewards:

- +1 for taking part.
- +1 to the winning Leader, regardless of whether they took part in the battle or not (in case of a draw, neither Leader gets this bonus).

- +1 for taking an enemy Leader or Champion Out of Action.
- +1 for killing an enemy (during the battle).
