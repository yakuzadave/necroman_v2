# 37. Toll Bridge

_Gangs fight over a vital bridge in the underhive._

**Source: Book of Peril**

## Battlefield

Standard. Leave a 12” wide corridor with no terrain or tiles down the middle of the board - this is the toxic river. Only a single bridge crosses the river - this is the toll bridge.

## Crews

- Custom (10).

## Tactics Cards

- Custom (2).
- Underdog (starting crew cost): +1 random per 100 credits.

## Deployment

Standard. Gangs must start on opposite sides of the river.

## Special Rule: The Toxic River

The gangs are fighting to control a valuable toll bridge spanning a toxic river.

Junk (barrels, barricades, loot caskets or ramshackle boats) can be spread across the river within a few inches of each other. This debris can be used to leap from one to the other, or as a makeshift boat. When standing on a piece of debris, a fighter can make a Row (Double) action.

:::info Row (Double)
Used in the Toll Bridge scenario. Use debris in the toxic river to move up to the Strength in inches. Then pass an Initiative test or fall into the river and go Out of Action.
:::

- Fighters can't voluntarily enter the river.
- Go Out of Action if falling into the river.
- If becoming Pinned while standing on debris, pass an Initiative test or go Out of Action.

#### Special Rule: The Bridge

The bridge uses an ancient mechanism to swing open or closed. It starts connected to the shore. In the 3rd End phase, and each subsequent End phase, roll a D6. On a 5, it pivots 90° to the left. On a 6, it pivotes 90° to the right. On any other result, it remains stationary.

:::note
The anchor point is probably at the centre of the bridge!
:::

When pivoting, fighters on the bridge within 1” of its ends must pass an Initiative test or fall from the bridge. If the ends were touching the shore before pivoting, fall onto the shore and become Prone. Otherwise, go Out of Action.

While the bridge is not connected to the shore, fighters on it can ignore the effects of failing a Bottle test (pass Cool test or flee). They have nowhere to go! However, when the bridge is connected to the shore, they must make tests as normal.

## Ending the Battle

The battle ends when at least 1 condition is true:

- Only one gang has fighters remaining.
- Only one gang has any fighters within 12" of the centre of the bridge.

## Victory

The winner is the remaining gang or the only gang with fighters within 12” of the centre of the bridge. Otherwise it is a draw.

## Rewards

#### Credits

- +3D6x10 to the winner.

#### Experience

Scenario specific rewards:

- +1 for taking part.
- +D3 for crossing the river.

Standard rewards:

- +1 for taking an enemy Out of Action.
- +1 for taking an enemy Leader or Champion Out of Action.
- +1 for killing an enemy (during the battle).
- +1 for Rallying.

#### Reputation

- +1 to each gang that took part in the battle.
- +D3 to the winner.

:::note Customised Bridge
The bridge may be fortified with barricades or a powerful brute or monster acting as its guardian. Fighters who crosses the bridge can escape off the enemy board edge to earn D6x10 credits.
