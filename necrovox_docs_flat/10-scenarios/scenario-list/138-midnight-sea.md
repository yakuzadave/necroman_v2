a special one that takes place in the depths of
the underhive. Vehicles and Wargear that grant
the Mounted condition may be included in any
gang’s crew.

## Battlefield

This scenario is designed to be played on a 4'x4'
battlefield. Starting with the winner of a roll-off,
players take turns placing 3+D3 large pieces of terrain
(between 6" and 12" in diameter) on the battlefield,
so they are at least 8" from the edge of the battlefield
or another piece of terrain (unless it would not be
possible to do so).

## Tactics Cards

## Deployment

Starting with the winner of a roll-off, players take turns placing their fighters and vehicles within 12"
of a battlefield edge and at least 6" from any enemy models. Only vehicles or fighters subject to the
Mounted condition may be placed on the battlefield
surface, all other fighters must be placed on a friendly
vehicle or piece of terrain.

:::info Narrative Variant

## Voyage of the Sump Queen

If players wish, they may use this scenario to represent the battle between the Carrion Queens and the Followers of the God of Many Mouths on the pitch-black sump sea beneath Hive Primus.

In order to do this, make the following changes:

- One gang should be represented by an Escher gang with at least one Sludge Barge to represent the Sump Queen.
- The other gang is represented by a Chaos Helot Cult gang, and must include a Chaos Spawn and at least three Scrap Skiffs.
- Both gangs can include Mounted fighters and vehicles as per the rules for creating Wasteland gangs.
