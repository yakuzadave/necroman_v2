# 82. Righteous Crusade

_A gang brings the fire of the Redemption to the underhive._

**Source: House of Faith**

:::info Designer's Note: Bringing Faith to the Faithless

While the scenarios provided here have been designed for House Cawdor gangs, there is no reason that, with the permission of the Arbitrator, they might not be
used for any gang.

Test of Faith lends itself well to multi-player games â€“ where
multiple gangs gather to test the strength of their newest members or even a
gathering of Cawdor gangs fight each other to weed out the weakest believers
among them. By contrast, Righteous Crusade can be used to represent any gang
that has been charged with clearing out an area of the underhive, whether in the
name of some unseen master, or perhaps in the employ of the Guilds, a criminal
syndicate or some other underhive power.

:::

## Attacker & Defender

Tie-breaker for determining the attacker:

1. Cawdor.
2. Lowest rating.
3. Roll-off (the winner can choose attacker/defender).

The other gang is the defender.

## Battlefield

Standard.

## Crews

- **Attacker:** Custom (10).
- **Defender:** Random (10).

## Tactics Cards

- Custom (2).
- Underdog (starting crew cost): +1 random per 100 credits

## Deployment

Standard.

## Cleansing The Underhive

_The attacker brings the fire of the Redemption, attempting to cleanse an area of the underhive and to drive out the faithless (chasing them from the battlefield)._

Starting with the End phase of the round 3 (and every subsequent End phase), the attacker can claim quarters:

- **Attacker:** A Standing fighter within 2" of the centre of a battlefield quarter.
- **Defender:** No fighters in that quarter (including Seriously Injured).

Once claimed, defending fighters cannot voluntarily enter it. Any defending fighters in a claimed quarter are removed from the battlefield in every End phase (counts as going Out of Action).

#### The Final Quarter

After 3 quarters are claimed, the attacker can flaim the 4th quarter even if there are defending fighters within its boundaries:

- **Attacker:** A Standing fighter within 2" of the centre of the battlefield quarter.
- **Defender:** No fighters within 3" of the centre of the battlefield quarter (including Seriously Injured).

Claiming the final quarter brings the battle to an end, but defending fighters do not go Out of Action.

## Ending the Battle

The battle ends when any of the following are true:

- Only one gang remains on the battlefield.
- All 4 quarters are claimed (by the attacker).

## Victory

The attacker wins if all 4 quarters are claimed. Otherwise the last remaining gang is the winner.

## Rewards

#### Credits

- 2D6x10 to attacker if claiming all 4 quarters.
- D6x10 to the defender if having fighters on the battlefield at the end of the battle.

#### Experience

Scenario specific rewards:

- +1 for taking part.
- +1 to each defending fighter still on the battlefield at the end of the battle.

Standard rewards:

- +1 for taking an enemy Out of Action.
- +1 for taking an enemy Leader or Champion Out of Action.
- +1 for killing an enemy (during the battle).
- +1 for Rallying.

#### Reputation

- +D3 to the winner.
- -1 for bottling out.
