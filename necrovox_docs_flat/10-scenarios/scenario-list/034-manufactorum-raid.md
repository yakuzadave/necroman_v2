# 34. Manufactorum Raid

_A raid against a rival House’s manufactorum._

**Source: Book of Peril**

## Attacked & Defender

The gang who chose this scenario is the attacker, the other is the defender. Otherwise, randomize one gang to choose who to be attacker and defender.

## Battlefield

Standard.

## Crews

- **Attacker:** Custom.
- **Defender:** Random (D3+5) + Reinforcements.

## Tactics Cards

- Custom (2).
- Underdog (starting crew cost): +1 random per 100 credits.

## Deployment

Standard. Then the attacker places 3 bomb markers at least 12” from another marker and at least 16” from the attacker’s deployment area. These are the points where the attacker must plant their bombs.

## Reinforcements

- Defender: D3.
- Each End phase (starting on the 2nd round).

## Special Rule: Bombs

The attacking crew is carrying a collection of homemade explosives to blow up machinery vital to the rival House.

Attackers must spend a Double action (Plant Bomb) if B2B with a bomb marker (including disarmed bombs):

- Gain 1 XP.

The planted bomb has a counter which starts with 1.

In the End phase, roll a D6 for each bomb, adding the result on its counter. On a 7+, the bomb explodes:

- Strength 6, Damage D3, Blast (5”), Knockback.

Otherwise, increase the counter’s number by 1.

Defenders can spend a Double action (Disarm Bomb) if B2B with a armed/planted bomb:

- Make an Intelligence test:
  - Success: Disarmed, gain D3 XP.
  - Fail: If the roll was a double, the bomb explodes.

A disarmed bomb must be rearmed by an attacker using the Plant Bomb (Double) action. The counter is reset to 1.

## Functioning Manufactorum

The Industrial Terrain in this scenario is fully functioning. Terrain activates on a 3+ rather than a 6+.

## Ending the Battle

The battle ends when at least 1 condition is true:

- Only one gang has fighters remaining.
- All 3 bombs explode.

## Victory

If all 3 bombs explode, the attacker wins. Otherwise, the defender wins.

#### Experience

Scenario specific rewards:

- +1 for taking part.
- +1 to each fighter that plants or rearms a bomb.
