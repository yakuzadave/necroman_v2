# 14. Downtown Dust-up

_Rival gangs fight it out for control of a settlement and its people._

_Source: Necromunda 2018 Rulebook_  

## Battlefield

Standard.

## Crews

- Random (D3+4).

## Tactics Cards

- Custom (2).
- Underdog (starting crew cost): +1 random per 100 credits.

## Deployment

Roll-off to see who deploys first. Alternate placing the fighters anywhere on the battlefield, at least 6” from an already deployed fighter (friend & foe). Then take turns placing D6+6 Hive Dwellers anywhere on the battlefield, at least 6” from the edge.

## Objectives

Each gang tries to run the other gang out of town, without too many of the locals caught in the crossfire.

## Special Rule: Hive Dwellers

Hivers are treated as fighters and use the normal rules for movement, stray shots, being Engaged and pinning. However, if reduced to 0 wounds, they are taken Out of Action without rolling any Injury dice.

| M   | WS  | BS  | S   | T   | W   | I   | A   | Ld  | Cl  | Wil | Int |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 5”  | 5+  | 5+  | 3   | 3   | 1   | 4+  | 1   | 7+  | 8+  | 9+  | 9+  |

Hivers do not activate normally and instead react to the actions of nearby fighters. Hivers are triggered by the following actions:

- A fighter makes a Shoot action within 12”
- A fighter makes a Fight action within 6”
- A blast is placed (after scatter) within 6”
- A fighter or hiver is hit by a ranged attack within 6”

After working out the effects of the action that triggered the hiver, roll a D6 on the table that follows (roll separately for each hiver that is triggered).

| D6  | Result                                                                                                                                          |
| --- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1-2 | **Damn Gangers messing up my Town!** Take a single Shoot action using a stub gun at the nearest fighter (even if they didn’t trigger the local) |
| 3-4 | **OK, take it Easy Fella**: Take no action                                                                                                      |
| 5-6 | **I’m getting outta here!** Become Broken (may rally in the End phase as normal by passing a Cool test)                                         |

During the End phase, take turns moving the hivers. Roll the Scatter dice for each one - on a Hit, the player moves the hiver its full Move in a direction of their choice, otherwise they make a full Move in the direction indicated (stopping if it contacts terrain or comes within 1” of another model).

:::note Alternative Variant (Hangers-on)

A Hangers-on could be mixed into the hive dwellers, perhaps the gunfight is taking place outside an Ammo-jack’s workshop or a Rogue Doc’s clinic.

:::

## Ending the Battle

The battle ends when only one gang has fighters remaining.

## Victory

If at least half of the hivers have been taken Out of Action or are Broken, it is a draw. Otherwise the winner is the gang with fighters left on the battlefield.
