# 73. Mercy Mission

_In the aftermath of a gang battle, both sides try to get their fallen fighters to safety._

**Source: White Dwarf, April 2021**

## Battlefield

Standard.

## Crews

- Random (5).

In addition, both teams add the following:

- 1 Rogue Doc (Hangers-on).
- 1 Hive Scum (Stub Gun).

## Tactics Cards

- None

## Deployment

Take turns (starting with the winner of a roll-off) in each of the following steps:

1. Place one of the 5 random enemy fighters anywhere on the battlefield, continue until all are deployed.
2. Place the friendly Rogue Doc & Hangers on a random battlefield edge. Then the other gang does the same on the opposite battlefield edge.

Note that the battlefield edge where the Rogue Doc and Hive Scum is placed counts as the gang’s edge for the purpose of XP rewards, ending and winning the battle.

## The Aftermath

_A brutal gang fight has taken place, and the battlefield is strewn with downed fighters._

All 5 random fighters from both teams begin:

- Seriously Injured (Recovery rolls are made as normal at the end of each round).
- Only 1 Wound remaining (if having more).
- All weapons counts as Out of Amo (can be reloaded as normal after recovering).

For this battle, all gangs (including all fighters) have the following effects:

- No Lasting Injuries if going Out of Action.
- No need to make Bottle tests.
