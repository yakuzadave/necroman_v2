:::info Narrative Variant

## Streets Of Cinderak City

If players wish, they may use this scenario to represent the street fighting as House Goliath moves in to take Cinderak City from House Escher.

In order to do this, make the following changes:

- One gang should be a Goliath gang made up of vehicles and transported fighters; the Goliath Mauler is especially appropriate.
- The other gang should be made up of Escher fighters with limited vehicles, though Escher
  Cutters are fitting for them to use.
