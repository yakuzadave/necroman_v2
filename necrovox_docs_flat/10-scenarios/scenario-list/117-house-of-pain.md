:::info Narrative Variant

## Fist Of The Over-Tyrant

If players wish, they may use this scenario to represent the fight for control of the House of
Chains between Djangar and Varran.

In order to do this, make the following changes:

- One gang should contain Djangar ‘Gunfists’ as its Challenger, the other a Goliath Tyrant equipped with equivalent levels of equipment. The rest of both gangs should be composed of Goliath gang members.
- At the end of each round, both Challengers heal up to their starting number of wounds.
- The two Challengers can only attack each other with close combat attacks.
