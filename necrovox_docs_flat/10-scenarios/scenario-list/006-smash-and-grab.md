## Attacker And Defender

In this scenario, one gang is the attacker and the other
is the defender. If this scenario is being played as part
of a campaign, then the gang that issued the challenge
is the attacker; otherwise, roll off with the winner
deciding whether they will attack or defend.

## Battle Type

This scenario is an Underhive battle, vehicles and
wargear that grant the Mounted condition cannot be
included in either gang’s starting crew.

## Battlefield

This scenario uses the standard rules for setting up
a battlefield, as described in the [Battlefield Set-up & Scenarios section](/docs/battlefield-setup/battlefield-set-up).

## Crews

This scenario uses the standard rules for choosing
a crew, as described in the [Scenario Rules: Choose Crew section](/docs/battlefield-setup/scenario-rules). The attacker uses the
Custom Selection (8) method to choose their crew. The
defender uses the Hybrid (3+D6) method to choose
their crew.

## Deployment

This scenario uses the standard rules for deployment as described in [Scenario Rules: Gang Tactics](/docs/battlefield-setup/scenario-rules#gang-tactics).

Additionally, the defender sets up five loot caskets
within their deployment zone, at least 4" from the edge
of the battlefield. No other loot caskets are used in
this scenario.

## Gang Tactics

This scenario uses the standard rules for gang tactics as described in [Scenario Rules: Gang Tactics](/docs/battlefield-setup/scenario-rules#gang-tactics).

## Ending The Battle

If either gang has no fighters left on the battlefield at
the end of any round, the battle ends immediately.

## Victory

The attacker wins if, at the end of the battle, they have
opened at least three loot caskets. Otherwise, the
defender wins.

## Rewards

#### Credits

The defender adds D6x10 credits to their Stash for
each loot casket which was not opened.

#### Experience

The victorious gang Leader earns D3 XP (regardless of
whether they took part in the battle or not).

#### Reputation

The victorious gang gains D3 Reputation.
If either gang bottled out, they lose 1 Reputation.

## Loot Caskets

The defender cannot open any loot caskets; they will
not be paid for any that are tampered with.

If the attacker opens a loot casket, instead of rolling on
the usual table, use the table below:

| &nbsp;D6&nbsp; | Result                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| :------------: | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|       1        | **Booby Trapped:** The loot casket was rigged to explode! Place the 5" blast maker centred over the loot casket, every model hit by it suffers a S4, AP -, D1 hit. Then remove the loot casket. |
|      2-5       | **Valuable Goods:** Add D6x10 credits to the attacking gang’s Stash. Then remove the loot casket.                                                                                               |
|       6        | **Jackpot:** Add 3D6x10 credits to the attacking gang’s Stash. Then remove the loot casket.                                                                                                     |

## Fleeing The Battlefield

If either gang voluntarily bottles out and subsequently
flees the battlefield, their opponent automatically wins
the scenario. If the attacker wins in this way, roll for
each remaining loot casket ignoring each result of
Booby Trapped.

_One gang is moving valuable merchandise for a Guilder contact. The other gang wants the loot!_

<h2> Attacker & Defender</h2>

The gang who chose this scenario is the attacker, the other is the defender. Otherwise, randomize one gang to choose who to be attacker and defender.

<h2> Battlefield</h2>

Standard: 6 tiles.

<h2> Crews</h2>

- **Attacker:** Custom (10).
- **Defender:** Random (D6+3).

<h2> Tactics Cards</h2>

- Attacker: Custom (2).
- Defender: Random (2).
- Underdog (starting crew cost): +1 random per 100 credits.

<h2> Deployment</h2>

Standard.

Additionally, the defender sets up 5 loot crates in their deployment zone, at least 4” from the edge of the battlefield.

- 3 ammo (ammo casket)
- 1 empty (no value)
- 1 frag trap (triggered when opened, then removed)

All are set up with the lids on, keeping the contents secret from the attacker until opened.

:::danger House Rule (Necrodamus)
This deployment is broken if defender sets up on an edge! Deploy loot caskets within the 3” deployment zone AND at least 4” from the edge of the battlefield? Also, having one gang march across the board, into or through the enemy gang, to open loot caskets is highly unrealistic! Apply this fix:

Deploy loot caskets within 2” of the middle line between both deployment zones.
:::

<h2> Objectives</h2>

The attacker wants to steal the Guilders’ loot crates. The defender is determined to drive off the attacker empty handed.

<h2> Special Rule: Loot Caskets</h2>

The defender can't open any loot caskets.

If the attacker opens a loot casket, do not roll to see what the contents are. Instead, remove the lid and apply the effects depending of the content.

<h2> Fleeing the Battlefield</h2>

If a gang voluntarily Bottles out and flees the battlefield, the other gang automatically wins the scenario. If the attacker wins this way, rewards are earned for the remaining loot caskets without risk of detonating a frag trap. If the defender wins this way, rewards are earned for any unopened loot caskets at the end of the battle.

<h2> Ending the Battle</h2>

The battle ends when only one gang has fighters remaining (at the end of a round).

<h2> Victory</h2>

The attacker wins they have opened more loot caskets containing ammo than are left unopened on the battlefield. Otherwise the defender wins.

<h2> Rewards</h2>

#### Credits

- D6x10 to the attacker for each opened ammo casket.
- 2D6x10 to the defender for each closed ammo casket.

#### Experience

Scenario specific rewards:

- +1 for taking part.
- +1 to the attacking Leader if at least 2 ammo caskets were opened (regardless of whether they took part in the battle or not).

Standard rewards:

- +1 for taking an enemy Out of Action.
- +1 for taking an enemy Leader or Champion Out of Action.
- +1 for killing an enemy (during the battle).
- +1 for Rallying.

#### Reputation

- +1 to the attacker for each opened ammo casket.
- -1 to the defender for each opened ammo casket.
- -1 to the attacker if the frag trap was opened.
- +1 to each gang if this was the first battle against each other.
- -1 to any gang that bottled out.
