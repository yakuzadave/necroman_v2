# 47. Ritual

_A tear in the veil._

**Source: Book of Ruin**

## Attacker & Defender

If only one gang is Chaotic, then that gang is the defender. Otherwise, the gang who chose this scenario is the attacker, the other is the defender.

## Battlefield

Standard.

## Crews

- **Attacker:** Custom (10)
- **Defender:** Random (10)

## Tactics Cards

- Custom (2).
- Underdog (starting crew cost): +1 random per 100 credits.

## Deployment

1. **Defender:** Within 12” of the centre of the battlefield.
2. **Attacker:** Base contact with any battlefield edge.
3. **Defender:** Choose a fighter to be the Ritual Leader.

## Ritual Leader

_The Ritual Leader must not be disturbed if the ritual is going to be completed._

The defender chooses any fighter to be the Ritual Leader:

- Can't activate or make actions.
- If Seriously Injured or taken Out of Action, nominate a different fighter as the Ritual Leader at the start of the following round (chosen by the defender).

## Daemonic Energies

_As the ritual nears completion, daemonic energies begin to ravage the battlefield._

Count how many turns there are an Active Ritual Leader on the battlefield in the End phase. After counting at least 1, roll a D6, adding the count to the result. Note that the Daemonic Ritual effects are cumulative. If the result is 10-12, also apply 7-9 and 4-6.

| D6 + Count | Result                                                                                                                   |
| :--------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
|    1-3     | **The Veil Weakens:** No effect (eerie noises and ethereal lights fill the battlefield).                                 |
|    4-6     | **Tendrils of Madness:** All fighters (except the Ritual Leader) gains Insanity.                                         |
|    7-9     | **Screams from Beyond:** All fighters suffer a -2 modifier to Willpower and Cool tests. Group Activations can't be made. |
|   10-12    | **Dancers on the Threshold:** A random fighter on the battlefield becomes possessed by a Daemon.                         |
|    13+     | **The Warp Vomits Forth:** All attackers must pass a Willpower or suffer an Injury roll. The battle ends.                |

:::note

After the Ritual Leader has remained Active until the End phase, a roll for Daemonic Ritual effect is always made. However, the counter doesn’t increase when the Ritual Leader is not Active in the End phase (Engaged, Seriously Injured or Out of Action).

:::

:::danger House Rule (Necrodamus)

This scenario is broken. The counter can never increase if the Ritual Leader is pinned, because the requirement of being Active (standing) and having no actions.

Solution: The Ritual Leader can never be Pinned. When nominating a new Ritual Leader, that fighter immediately stands up (if Pinned).

:::

## Ending the Battle

The battle ends when at least one of the following is true:

- Only one gang has fighters remaining (at the start of a round).
- The Warp Vomits Forth (13+ on the Daemonic Ritual table).

## Victory

- **Defender:** The Warp Vomits Forth.
- **Any:** Last remaining gang.

### Leaping

The Daemon leaps to another fighter on a 5+ each End phase. The next target is the closest Standing fighter (randomize if there are multiple fighters equally close). After the leap, the previous host gains Insanity.

### Creature Of The Warp

When rolling on the Perils of the Warp table, treat Daemonic Possession (11-12) as Warp Surge! (9-10). The fighter is already possessed, so can't be possessed again.

### Underhive Exorcism

The Daemon is exorcised on a 5+ if:

- Seriously Injured or taken Out of Action by a Melee weapon.
- Coup de Grace.

Otherwise, it leaps to the next target.
