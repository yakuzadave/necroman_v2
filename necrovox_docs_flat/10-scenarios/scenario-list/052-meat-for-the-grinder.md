# 52. Meat for the Grinder

_The weak become meat._

**Source: Book of Ruin**

## Battlefield

Standard.

## Crews

- The 3 lowest rated fighters in each gang.

## Tactics Cards

- Random (2).
- Underdog (lowest Gang Rating): Random (1).

## Deployment

1. Standard.
2. Take turns placing 2 loot caskets each (starting with the gang with Priority):
   - At least 10” from any fighter.
   - At least 4” from another loot casket.

## Desperation

_The weak become meat._

All fighters are considered to have:

- [True Grit](/docs/gang-fighters-and-their-weaponry/skills/#5-true-grit)
- [Iron Jaw](/docs/gang-fighters-and-their-weaponry/skills/#6-iron-jaw)
- [Unstoppable](/docs/gang-fighters-and-their-weaponry/skills/#6-unstoppable)

## Scavenged Weaponry

_Fighters must scavenge weapons from the battlefield._

- No weapon restrictions apply during the battle.
- Fighters begin without any weapons or wargear (considered to be safely back in the gang’s Stash).
- If a fighter is taken Out of Action after acquiring any weapons, leave the weapons on the fighter’s last position on the battlefield (can be scavenged by remaining fighters).

Fighters can spend a Basic action (Loot) if B2B with a loot casket or a dropped weapon. For loot caskets, roll 2D6, then remove the loot casket:

| D6  |                    Result |

|  2  |             Heavy Stubber |
|  3  |                    Flamer |
|  4  |                   Autogun |

:::note

Automatically fails any Ammo tests (scavenged weapons are of the poorest quality).

:::

All scavenged weapons are discarded after the battle.

## Ending the Battle

The battle ends when only one gang has fighters remaining (at the end of a round).

## Victory

The last remaining gang is the winner. If there are multiple gangs remaining:

- **Uprising:** The gang with Ascendancy is the winner.
- **Otherwise:** Draw.

## Rewards

#### Credits

- 2D6x10 to the winner.

#### Experience

Scenario specific rewards:

- +1 for taking part.
- +1 if on the battlefield at the end.

Standard rewards:

- +1 for taking an enemy Out of Action.
- +1 for taking an enemy Leader or Champion Out of Action.
- +1 for killing an enemy (during the battle).
- +1 for Rallying.

#### Reputation

- +D3 for winning.
- -1 to any gang that bottled out.

:::danger House Rule (Necrodamus)

For simplicity, Psychic Vomit (Basic) is treated like Scouring (Basic), as it has the same effect. At least as far as anything can have the same effect as Scouring, including Scouring itself, since there are already so many versions of this weapon profile.
