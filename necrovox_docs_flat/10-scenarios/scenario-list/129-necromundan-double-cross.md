# 129. Necromundan Double-cross

_“No doubt you’re all wondering why I called you here…”_  
\- Haera Helmawr, 13th Daughter of Gerontius Helmawr, House Helmawr

In this scenario, a group of gang leaders and champions are set up and betrayed by one of their rivals.

## Attacker & Defender

- One gang is the attacker, all others are the defender.
- The gang who chose this scenario is the attacker, the others are the defender. Otherwise, randomize one gang to choose who to be attacker and defender.

## Battlefield

Standard (Zone Mortalis), designed for a 2'x2' battlefield.

## Crews

- Custom (2).
- Requires leader and a champion.

No vehicles or mounts.

## Tactics Cards

- Custom (2).

## Deployment

Starting with the fighter with the highest credit cost,
the defending gangs deploy their fighters within 12"
of the centre of the battlefield, at least 3" away from
any already deployed fighter. The attacker then places
their fighters anywhere on the battlefield, at least 6"
away from any enemy fighters.

1. Defenders deploy within 12" of the centre of the battlefield, 3" away from another fighter.
   - Start with the highest credit cost fighter.
2. Attacker deploys anywhere on the battlefield, at least 6" away from any enemy fighters.

## Rising Tension

_The Leaders and their Champions have met on neutral ground, under a banner of truce. This means that weapons are limited, and neither side is willing to be the first to start the shooting._

Until the Double-cross is triggered (see below), when a fighter is activated
they must make a Cool check. If the check is failed, the fighter can only take one action this round instead of two.

Additionally, until the Double-cross is triggered, only weapons with the Melee trait may be used to make attacks.

## The Double-Cross

_The attacking gang knows this is a set-up and can choose their moment to spring the Double-cross._

At the start of any round, the attacker can trigger the
Double-cross. As soon as they do, the Rising Tension rule ceases to be in effect. If any fighter is taken Out of Action, the Double-cross is automatically triggered.

### Old Enmities

If this scenario is being played with three to six
players, each player rolls on the Old Enmities table to
see what scores their Leader has to settle. Players take
turns rolling, starting with the gang with the lowest
gang rating. If a Leader rolls a result already rolled by another Leader, re-roll the result.

In addition, such is the burning hatred the gangs have for each other they do not need to make Bottle tests in this scenario.

#### OLD ENMITIES

| --- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | **Pure Loathing:** Randomly select an enemy fighter. Your Leader may re-roll close combat attacks against that fighter.                                                                                                                               |
| 2   | **Gnawing Fear:** For the duration of the battle, your Leader counts their Initiative as 2+ when making the Retreat (Basic) action. In addition, enemy fighters may not make Reaction attacks against them when they make the Retreat (Basic) action. |
| 3   | **Haughty Disdain:** Once during the battle your Leader may activate first in a round, regardless of who has priority.                                                                                                                                |
| 4   | **Healthy Paranoia:** Randomly select an enemy fighter. Your Leader gains a 5+ field armour save against attacks from that fighter.                                                                                                                   |
| 5   | **Homicidal Urges:** Once during the battle, when your Leader activates, they may move D6" and perform a Coup de Grace (Simple) action without using an Action.                                                                                       |
| 6   | **Overdue Payback:** Randomly select an enemy Leader. If your Leader takes the selected Leader Out of Action then they gain an additional D6 XP.                                                                                                      |

:::info Narrative Variant

## Haera’s Bloody Banquet

If players wish, they may use this scenario to
represent the battle between Haera and her
siblings for control of House Helmawr.

In order to do this, make the following changes:

- The defending gangs should be represented by [Underhive Outcasts Leaders](/docs/gangs/gang-lists/outcasts) and Underhive Outcasts Champions, each with a single suit of armour and a single weapon with the Melee trait.
- Starting with the player with the lowest gang rating, each player may then choose an item from the Spire Black Market for their leader. No two Leaders may be equipped with the same item from this list.
- The attacking gang is represented by [Lady Haera Helmawr](/docs/gangs/gang-additions/hired-guns/agents/#lady-haera)
- Once during the battle, when Haera is Seriously Injured or taken Out of Action, place her to one side. At the start of the End phase of the current round, place her anywhere on the battlefield at least 3" from any other fighter, restored to her full complement of wounds.

#### Spire Black Market Items

- Archeo duelling pistol
- Barbed flabellum
- Camoelean elixir
- Digi-multi lasers
- Draconic scales
- Haemophagic blade
- Mirror Aegis
- Psychofamile pheromone
