## Attacker & Defender

The gang who chose this scenario is the attacker, the other is the defender. Otherwise, randomize one gang to choose who to be attacker and defender.

## Battlefield

Standard (Ash Wastes). Size approximately 3'x3' to 4'x4'.

## Crews

Vehicles can be included (defender must include at least 1 as the Broken Down vehicle).

- **Attacker:** Custom (8) + Reinforcements.
- **Defender:** Random (D3+2) + Reinforcements. Additionally, add 1 random vehicle to be the Broken Down Vehicle.

## Tactics Cards

- Custom (2).
- **Underdog** (starting crew cost): +1 random per 100 credits.

## Deployment

1. **Defender:** Set up the Broken Down Vehicle in the centre. Then set up the entire crew within 6" of the Broken Down Vehicle.
2. **Attacker:** Entire crew within 6" of any battlefield edge, at least 9" from enemies.

## Reinforcements

- Start of each End phase.
- X (where X is the round/turn number) per gang. 1 for the first end phase, 2 for the second end phase, etc.
- Within 3" of any battlefield edge.

## Broken Down Vehicle

_The defenders must protect the Broken Down Vehicle until the crew can make it running again and fend off an assault by the attackers._

The Broken Down Vehicle cannot move or shoot.

At the start of each round, roll a D6 + the round/turn number:

| &nbsp;&nbsp;D6&nbsp;&nbsp; | Result                                                                                                  |
| :------------------------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|            2-3             | **Still Busted:** No effect (roll again next round).                                                    |
|            4-5             | **Getting Closer:** +1 to the next roll.                                                                |
|            6-7             | **Gun Operational:** The guns are now functioning. If this result is rolled again, +1 to the next roll. |
|             8              | **False Start:** Move 2D6" in any direction.                                                            |
|             9              | **Fully Repaired:** Move & shoot normally (stop rolling to repair again).                               |

The vehicle escapes if contacting a battlefield edge.
