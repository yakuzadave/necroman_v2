# 60. The Beat Down

_Wrong place, wrong time._

**Source: House of Chains**

## Battlefield

Standard.

## Crews

- Random (D3+4).

## Tactics Cards

- Custom (2).
- Underdog (starting crew cost): +1 random per 100 credits.

## Deployment

1. Roll-off to see determine who deploys a fighter first. The first fighter can be placed anywhere on the battlefield (not in impassable terrain).
1. Alternate placing the remaining fighters within 12” of the first fighter.

If there is no room within 12” of the first fighter, or no room outside 1” of an enemy, deploy as close as possible to the first fighter.

:::danger House Rule (Necrodamus)

During deployment, the first fighter must be placed at least 6” from any battlefield edge.

## You Looking At Me?

_The gangs have chanced upon each other and are passing each other in the underhive when the violence starts. They may well have gone on their way if one of the fighters hadn’t decided they didn’t like the way their rivals were looking at them._

In round 1, only a single random fighter per team is Readied.
In each subsequent Priority phase, each gan can choose to Ready a number of fighters equal to the current round (not random). No fighters are required to be Readied.

Fighters without Ready markers:

- Take no part in the battle (only spectating).
- Provide no benefits (assists, Leading By Example etc.).
- Can't be targeted by attacks or damaged by blasts and templates.

However, all fighters still follow normal rules for:

- Counted for Bottle tests.
- Enemy fighters must stay more than 1” away.

If one gang choose to not Ready any fighters, the battle is effectively lost.

:::note Alternative Variant
Can be played with any gangs, not just Goliath.

This can also be used for multi-player battles. Perhaps multiple gangs have found themselves in a tense stand-off, after randomly running into each other in a seedy drinking hole, and now must prove their might without things getting ‘too’ out of hand.

## Ending the Battle

The battle ends when only one gang has Ready fighters remaining (after a Priority phase).

## Victory

The side with at least one fighter with a Ready marker when the battle ends is the winner.
