# 10. Sabotage

_A gang sneaks onto a rival’s turf, hoping to put one of their territories out of commission._

_Source: Necromunda 2018 Rulebook_  

## Attacker & Defender

The gang who chose this scenario is the attacker, the other is the defender. Otherwise, randomize one gang to choose who to be attacker and defender.

## Battlefield

Standard. The defender sets up a piece of terrain, which should be at least 2” square, to represent the attacker’s target. It is recommended that it is set up as close to the centre of the battlefield as possible.

## Crews

- **Attacker:** Custom.
- **Defender:** Custom (5 Sentries) + Reinforcements.
  If a sentry has multiple equipment sets, randomize which one is used.

## Home Turf Advantage

Defender:

- **Bottle tests:** Roll 2D6 and discard the highest.
- **Rally tests:** +1.
- **Hangers-on:** Included in the crew on a 4+ (roll individually).

## Tactics Cards

- Attacker: Custom (3).
- Defender: Random (2).
- Underdog (starting crew cost): +1 random per 100 credits.

## Deployment

1. Defender: Anywhere on the battlefield.
1. Attacker: Within 2” of any edges of the battlefield.

## Reinforcements

- Defender: 1.
- Each End phase (starting on the 2nd round).

## Objectives

The attackers are attempting to destroy their target and deal a blow to their target’s territory. The defenders are trying to stop this at all costs!

## Destroying the Target

The target has:

- Toughness 6.
- 5+ save.
- 4 Wounds.
- Large & stationary:
  - +2 hit modifier to all ranged attacks.
  - Any close combat attacks automatically hit.

## Reinforcements

- Defender: D6.
- Each End phase (starting on the round the alarm is raised).

## Taking Flight

Once the attackers have destroyed the target, they can take flight within 1” of an edge of the battlefield at the start of the End phase (even if Seriously Injured). They count as being Out of Action for the purposes of Bottle tests.

## Fleeing the Battlefield

If the defender voluntarily Bottles out and flees the battlefield, the attacker automatically wins the scenario. The target is destroyed but no XP is gained for doing so after the defenders have fled.

## Ending the Battle

The battle ends when only one gang has fighters remaining (at the end of a round).

## Victory

The attacker wins if they have destroyed the target and fewer than half of the crew has been taken Out of Action. If the target is not destroyed, the defender wins. Otherwise, the battle ends in a draw.

## Rewards

#### Credits

- D6x10 to the attacker if the target was destroyed.
- D6x10 to the defender if the target was not destroyed.

#### Experience

Scenario specific rewards:

- +1 for taking part.
- +1 for each Wound caused on the target.
- +1 for destroying the target.
- +1 to the attacking Leader if the target was destroyed (regardless of whether they took part in the battle or not).

Standard rewards:

- +1 for taking an enemy Out of Action.
- +1 for taking an enemy Leader or Champion Out of Action.
- +1 for killing an enemy (during the battle).
- +1 for Rallying.

#### Reputation

- +3 to the attacker if the target was destroyed.
- -1 to the defender if the target was destroyed.
- +1 to both gangs if this was the first battle against each other.
- -1 to any gang that bottled out.

:::danger House Rule (Necrodamus)
**Problem:** Infiltrate can be imbalanced or break this scenario.

**Solution:** If at least one player wants, Infiltrate can't be used in this scenario. Instead, Infiltrating fighters can make 1 or 2 move actions before the first round.
