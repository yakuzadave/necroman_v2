# 66. Road Block

_A bloody road to victory._

**Source: House of Iron**

:::info Designer's Note: Challenge Accepted!

While the scenarios presented here have been designed specifically for House
Orlock gangs, there is no reason that, with the permission of the Arbitrator, they
might not be used for any gang.

Both scenarios also lend themselves well to
multi-player scenarios – such as the Big Bar Brawl where multiple gangs punch
it out in a drunken free-for-all in the middle of some underhive drinking hole. Alternatively, Road Block can make for an interesting Arbitrated battle, with
the Arbitrator taking control of the road blocks and one or more gangs trying to
break through to the other side of the battlefield, or even with a gang in charge
of each road block as part of an uneasy alliance, their fighters under attack by
the forces of the Arbitrator.

## Attacker & Defender

Tie-breaker for determining the attacker:

1. Lowest rating.
2. Roll-off (the winner can choose attacker/defender). The other gang is the defender.

## Battlefield

The defender sets up the battlefield to represent a road going from one side to the opposite side. This road can twist and turn, can include doors and other obstacles, but must be traversable from one battlefield edge to the other. The rest of the battlefield is considered impassable.

The defender delegates one end of the road as the entrance and the other as the exit.

The defender sets up 3 road blocks along the length of the road (barricades or anything else that provides cover). Each road block should completely fill a section of the road.

## Crews

- **Attacker:** Custom (10).
- **Defender:** Random (10).

## Tactics Cards

- Custom (2).
- Underdog (starting crew cost): +1 random per 100 credits.

## Deployment

1. **Defender:** Within 6” of any road block. Each road block must have at least 1 fighter deployed within 6”.
2. **Attacker:** Within 6” of the road entrance.

## Road Blocks

_The attacker is trying to break through the defender’s trade route._

Fighters behind a road block gain full cover.

Can be targeted and destroyed by ranged or melee attacks:

- T5 and W5.
- Can be torn down by a B2B fighter in a similar way as forcing open a door:
  - D6+Str > 8

When destroyed or torn down, it is removed from the battlefield.

## Home Run

Any attacker that finishes a Move action B2B with the road exit can escape (removed from the battlefield). This does not count as having gone Out of Action, but is also not counted for the purposes of Bottle tests.

## Ending the Battle

The battle ends when only one gang has fighters remaining.

## Victory

The attacker wins if 3+ fighters escaped. Otherwise the defender wins.

## Rewards

#### Credits

- D6x10 to the attacker for each escaped fighter.
- D6x10 credits to the defender for winning.

#### Experience

Scenario specific rewards:

- +1 for taking part.
- +1 to each attacker that escaped.

Standard rewards:

- +1 for taking an enemy Out of Action.
- +1 for taking an enemy Leader or Champion Out of Action.
- +1 for killing an enemy (during the battle).
- +1 for Rallying.

#### Reputation

- +D3 to the attacker for winning.
- -1 for bottling out.

:::danger House Rule (Necrodamus)

The defender should probably not win if voluntarily failing a Bottle test or fleeing the battlefield before the attacker has reached the exit with 3+ fighters.
