## Battle Type

This scenario is an Underhive battle; vehicles
and wargear that grant the Mounted condition
cannot be included in either gang’s starting crew
or Reinforcements.

## Battlefield

This scenario uses the standard rules for setting up
a battlefield, as described in the [Battlefield Set-up & Scenarios section](/docs/battlefield-setup/battlefield-set-up).

## Crews

This scenario uses the standard rules for choosing a
crew, as described in the [Scenario Rules: Choose Crew section](/docs/battlefield-setup/scenario-rules). Both gangs use the Hybrid
Selection (D3+3) method to determine their crew. The
rest of each gang’s Fighter cards are shuffled together
to form the Reinforcements decks.

## Deployment

The players roll off and the winner picks one half of the
battlefield to be their turf, then draws a card at random
from their starting crew and sets up that fighter in their
turf, 1" away from the centre of the battlefield. The
other player then does the same in the opposite half of
the battlefield (their turf).

Then, starting with the player that set up the first
fighter, the players take turns setting up the remaining
fighters in their starting crew using the standard rules
for deployment.

Finally, each player places a gang relic in their own turf.
This can either be a generic token or a small terrain
feature. The gang relic must be set up at least 5" away from any edge of the battlefield.

## Gang Tactics

Unless one player has a lower Gang Rating than their
opponent, as follows, neither player has any gang
tactics at the start of the battle. Instead, at the start
of each round after the first, each player randomly
determines a gang tactic.

If, during the pre-battle sequence, one player’s Gang
Rating is less than their opponent’s, then they may
randomly determine a gang tactic during step 7 of
the pre-battle sequence for each full 100 credits
of difference.

## Ending The Battle

If either gang has no fighters left on the battlefield at
the end of any round, the battle ends immediately.

## Victory

If one gang has any fighters on the battlefield – not
including Prone and Seriously Injured fighters – at the
end of the battle, and their gang relic has not been
defiled, they are victorious. Any other result is a draw.

## Rewards

#### Credits

If a gang’s relic was not defiled, they add D6x10 credits
to their Stash. Otherwise, they add D3x10 credits to
their Stash.

#### Experience

If a fighter defiles an enemy gang’s relic, they earn
D3 XP.

The victorious gang’s Leader earns D3 XP (regardless of whether they took part in the battle or not).

#### Reputation

If one gang’s Relic was defiled and the other's was not,
the gang with the defiled Relic loses D3 Reputation
and the other gang gains D3 Reputation.
If either gang bottled out, they lose 1 Reputation.

## Gang Relics

Add 2 to the result of any Cool tests and Leadership
tests made for friendly fighters within 6" of their
gang relic.

## Defile The Relic

A fighter within 1" of an enemy gang’s relic may
perform the Defile Relic (Double) action.

**Defile Relic (Double):** The relic is defiled by the
activating fighter. Once a relic has been defiled, it no
longer offers any bonuses to Cool tests and Leadership
tests, and cannot be defiled again.

## Reinforcements

At the start of each End phase, each player rolls a
D3 and receives that many Reinforcements. These
are deployed one at a time, starting with the player
that has the Priority marker and alternating until all
Reinforcements are deployed.

## Fleeing The Battlefield

If either gang voluntarily bottles out and flees the
battlefield, their opponent automatically wins the
scenario. Additionally, if the losing gang’s relic hasn’t
been defiled, a random fighter from the winning gang is
considered to have defiled it.
