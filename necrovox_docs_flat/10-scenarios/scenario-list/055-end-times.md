## It’S The End Of The World

_The last hours are at hand and all that remains is for the remaining survivors to battle it out to the bitter end._

At the start of each round, apply the End Times effects depending of the current round. Note that the effects are cumulative, so in round 4-6, also apply effects from round 1-3.

| Round | End Times                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| :---: | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  1-3  | **Insanity Reigns:** All fighters must pass a Willpower test or gain Insanity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|  4-6  | **Spontaneous Mutation:** Roll a D6 for all fighters with Insanity and apply the following bonus for this round: <br /><br /><table><thead><tr><th>D6</th><th>Result</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>+2 S</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>+2” M</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>+1 A</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>+1 I</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>+2 T</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>+3 A</td></tr></tbody></table> |
|  7+   | **Daemonic Incursion:** When taken Out of Action, place a 5” blast on this fighter before being removed. All fighters hit become possessed by a Daemon. Note that these Daemons will not jump between bodies and remain until exorcised or the battle ends.                                                                                                                                        |

## The Last Stratoplane

_What little hope survives for the gangs is to reach the last stratoplane fleeing the dying hive._

In each End phase, starting on the 3rd round, a transport arrives on a 5+. The cargo ramp scatters 12” from the centre of the battlefield (closest approximation not in impassable terrain).

Fighters can embark on the transport and be removed from the battlefield if ending a movement B2B with the cargo ramp. A fighter may not embark or disembark in the same round.

#### Departure

In each End phase, the transport can depart or remain grounded. If there are fighters from more than 1 gang embarked, roll-off to determine who can decide to attempt to depart or remain grounded:

1. **More than 1 gang:** Roll-off, adding the number of embarked fighters to results (re-roll ties). The winner can choose to attempt to take off or remain grounded.
2. **Attempt to take off:** Pass a single Intelligence test for an embarked fighter (in control) to depart.

## Ending the Battle

The battle ends when at least one of the following is true:

- Only one gang has fighters remaining (at the start of a round).
- The transport departs.

## Victory

The gang with the most departing fighters in the transport is the winner. Tiebreaker: The gang with the most surviving fighters on the battlefield.

## Rewards

#### Experience

Scenario specific rewards:

- +D3 for embarking the transport.
- +D3 per Daemon destroyed.

Standard rewards:

- +1 for taking an enemy Out of Action.
- +1 for taking an enemy Leader or Champion Out of Action.
- +1 for killing an enemy (during the battle).
- +1 for Rallying.

#### Reputation

- +D6 for winning.
- +D3 for having fighters embarked on the transport at the end of the battle.
