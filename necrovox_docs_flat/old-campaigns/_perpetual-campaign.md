# Perpetual Campaign

:::info
You are viewing the archived rules from before the 2023 Core books. Use the menu to navigate to the current rules.
:::

The phases of a single campaign can be looped where each loop is a full campaign. Gangs can simply continue without any modifications.

### Refreshing Territories

Territories may be refreshed between campaigns. Each gang may retain 1 territory per 1000 Gang Rating. The rest of the territories are lost, and a new set of territories is determined.

#### Dominion

Only add random gang specific Territories for each House from new gangs that join. The total number of Territories is determined as usual, counting all gangs - new and old.

### Changing Campaign Type

If the next campaign is of a different type, discard all specific elements from the previous campaign.

## Maximum Starting Crew Sizes

Additional crew size limits may be used in scenarios with Unlimited Crew selection:

| Gang Rating | Max Crew Size |
| ----------- | ------------- |
| 1001-2000   | 15            |
| 2001-3000   | 20            |
| 3001+       | 25            |

## Patronage

The underdog may purchase temporary benefits for each 100 credits of difference in startin crew cost or Gang Rating (depending on scenario), rounding down. This replaces the normal underdog bonus of drawing additional Tactics cards. Any credits not spent are lost.

| Limit | Benefit                        | Cost |
| ----- | ------------------------------ | ---- |
| 0-5   | Tactics card (Random)          | 100  |
| 0-2   | Tactics card (Custom)          | 200  |
| 0-1   | Sub-plot (Random)              | 100  |
| 0-1   | Sub-plot (Custom)              | 200  |
| 0-\*  | Underdog Tactics card (Random) | 200  |
| 0-\*  | Hanger-on                      | \*   |
| 0-3   | Ganger                         | \*   |
| 0-\*  | Juve                           | \*   |
| 0-1   | Dramatis Personae              | \*   |
| 0-1   | Bounty Hunter                  | \*   |
| 0-5   | Hive Scum                      | \*   |

All benefits are temporary for this battle only, so for example Bounty Hunters are not subject to “We’ll Get Our Bit…” special rule.

Any normal restrictions must be kept, for example gang composition and hangers-on limit.

Hired fighters:

- Not limited by any Crew size restrictions.
- Automatically included in crew (regardless of selection method).
- Can't be activated as part of a Group Activation.
- Does not count as present at the start of the battle for the purpose of Bottle tests.

:::note Minimum Difference
A minimum difference of 400 credits between gangs may be used. If the difference is less, the underdog may draw tactics cards instead as normal.
:::

## Going Out In a Blaze of Glory

A gang with Gang Rating above 4000 (or any other agreed-upon limit) can decide to either retire or to go out in a Blaze of Glory.

The gang takes part in the Escape the Hive scenario:

- The entirety of the gang is used (including Hangers-on).
- Any hired Special Characters and Bounty Hunters leave the gang and give no support to the gang (for example Bounty Hunters with “We’ll Get Our Bit…”).
- Any leftover credits may be spent as usual.
- Hired Guns may be purchased.

:::danger House Rule (Necrodamus)
The original rules released in White Dwarf (May 2019) was extremely messy with numerous problems and contradictions. To make any kind of sense of this, a few decisions were made here:

- Applied standard restrictions when hiring any temporary fighters. For example it was impossible to determine if temporary juves were restricted by gang composition or not.
- Removed the possibility to auto-include hangers-ons in the crew. Otherwise Ammo Jacks with Boltguns and BS 3+ for 50 credits would be much better than similar options.
