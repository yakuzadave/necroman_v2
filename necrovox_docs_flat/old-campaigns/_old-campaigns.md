# Campaigns

You are viewing the archived rules from before the 2023 Core books. Use the menu to navigate to the current rules.
:::

There are currently six types of campaigns. Each campaign is based around gangs fighting battles for the control of resources of some type, from Territories to Road Section to Sympathisers.

Most battles in the campaign are fought for control of a one of these resources. The resource being fought over is the stake of a battle, and most battles have a resource at stake on the outcome. Instead of fighting over a resource, the stake may instead be Captives held by the opponent gang.

## Gang Attributes

Gangs have the following attributes (tracked on the roster):

1. **Gang Rating:** The total cost of all of the fighters in the gang.
2. **Reputation:** Starts at 1 and can't drop below 1.
3. **Wealth:** The total cost of all fighters, credits and equipment in the stash.
4. **Alignment/Allegiance:** Campaigns can divide gangs into sides, although this isn't used in all campaigns. Teams on the same side can still fight each other.

## Trading Post & Black Market

Even if a campaign doesn’t use the Trading Post or Black Market, they are optional and can be included.

## Challenges

Each gang can issue any number of challenges.

- If declined, the stake is automatically claimed by the challenger.
- Challenges may be declined without penalty by a gang that has received at least 1 challenge (this cycle).
- Can use Rescue Mission to free Captives instead of nominating a Resource as the stake of a battle.

The winner of the challenge takes control of the Resource at stake. If the result is a draw, the Resource is not transferred (remains uncontrolled or with the controlling gang).

## Campaign Phases and Cycles

All campaigns are divided into 3 phases. Each phase lasts a number of cycles, which is an arbitrary amount of time that can be agreed upon.

### Phase 1 (3 Cycles)

Each battle is rewarded by a single uncontrolled Resource. The gangs decide which currently available Resource is at stake when issuing and accepting challenges.

### Phase 2 (1 Cycle)

Most campaigns complete the following steps. Note that some have an additional 5th step (these are detailed on the relevant campaign page), and Law & Misrule does not do step #2.

#### 1. Fighters Recover

Fighters are no longer In Recovery.

#### 2. Captives Are Returned

Any Captured fighters are released. The gang that had captured them receives half their credits value (rounding up to the nearest 5 credits). This is paid by friends and family, not the gang the Captured fighters belong to.

#### 3. Experienced Juves Are Promoted

Juves with 5+ Advancements are promoted to Champions. Their characteristics and credits value are unaffected, but their Type is changed. From now on, they are treated as a Champion in all respects.

#### 4. Fresh Recruitment

All gangs gain 250 credits to recruit new fighters and/or Hangers-on. These credits must be spent now and can't be added to the gang’s Stash. Gangs may supplement these credits with extra credits from their Stash.

:::tip YAQ
Can only be spent on hangers-on, fighters and equipment for those fighters. Equipment can be purchased the same way as it is when founding the gang (can only be purchased from the House Equipment List, must be equipped to one of the fresh recruits) except there is no limitation on the number of special weapons you can get for your new gangers.

#### Side Battles

After the effects of Downtime are applied, gangs can fight side battles. Fighters can earn Experience and suffer Lasting Injuries as normal, but no Income, Credits or Reputation is gained, awarded or earned. Instead, special rewards, an unique drug or custom Tactics cards can be created as rewards for winning side battles.

### Phase 3 (3 Cycles)

Challengers nominate a Resource currently controlled by their opponent.

### Ending the Campaign

After Phase 3, the campaign ends. There are a number of Triumphs depending on campaign type that are listed on their respective campaign pages. A gang may earn more than one, and in case of a tie, no one is awarded it.

New Splinter gangs created based on the old gain bonuses for the next cycle. Triumphs only last for a single cycle.

## Running a Campaign

### The Arbitrator

A campaign requires one of the
players to take on the role of an Arbitrator. It is the
Arbitrator’s job to:

- Organise the players and making a list of all of the gangs involved in the campaign.
- Keep track of victories.
- Set the rules of the campaign, being clear around what house rules are in place.
- Keep the players informed as to the progression of the campaign and keeping track of the control of the resources at stake.
- Decide when each phase of the campaign begins and ends, as well as when the overall campaign starts and finishes.
- Offer guidance for the players and control any random events or elements.
- Try to ensure that everyone has a fun, memorable campaign experience!

:::info Yaktribe

While not the only way to manage a campaign, the go-to standard is to use [Yaktribe](https://yaktribe.games/underhive) for all administration needs. Here players can create and maintain their gangs, and an arbitrator can create a campaign and add these gangs to it. It'll then allow players to maintain their progress, and do all the bookkeeping on battles, Territories, and leaderboards such as reputation, wealth or power.
