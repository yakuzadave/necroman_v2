# Lasting Injuries & Damage

:::info
You are viewing the archived rules from before the 2023 Core books. Use the menu to navigate to the current rules.
:::

When going Out of Action, a model will suffer one of the following (depending on type):

- Fighter: Lasting Injury roll.
  - Chaotic: Mutation (conditional).
- Vehicle:
  - Crew Lasting Injury roll.
  - Lasting Damage roll (suffer 2 rolls if reduced to 0 Wounds and rolling over at the same time).

If an Injury roll results in more than 1 Out of Action result, roll separately on the Lasting Injuries table for each.

:::danger House Rule (A&A)
Only take one Injury roll per fighter
:::

### Going Into Recovery

When going Into Recovery, miss both the post-battle sequence of the current battle and the next battle in order to recover. This means that Leaders and Champions going Into Recovery can't perform post-battle actions after the battle they received the injury. No matter how many Lasting Injury rolls are made, the effect only applies once (does not stack).

### Characteristic Penalties

A fighter can gain a decrease in a Characteristic. This does not decrease the cost. Note that a decrease in a characteristic that is depicted as a target number actually increase this number. For example if WS 4+ is decreased, it becomes WS 5+.

### Minimum Characteristics

Characteristics can't be reduced beyond a certain level. If reduced below this level, go Into Recovery, but suffer no additional penalty.

#### Fighters

|                       |              |
| --------------------- | ------------ |
| WS, BS and I:         | Minimum 6+.  |
| Cl, Ld, Will and Int: | Minimum 12+. |
| S, T, M & W:          | Minimum 1.   |

#### Vehicles

|            |                              |
| ---------- | ---------------------------- |
| Toughness: | Minimum 3 (front/side/rear). |
| Sv:        | 6+.                          |
| Hnd:       | 10+.                         |

### Succumbing To Injuries

Seriously Injured fighters at the end of a battle survive without Lasting Injuries on a 3+. On a 1-2, they succumb to their injuries and are treated as having gone Out of Action (suffer a Lasting Injury roll as normal).

## Mutations

_Open wounds are a gateway for more than just disease and rot._

The following gangs have additional effects when suffering Lasting Injuries:

- Corpse Grinder Cult
- Chaos Cult
- Corrupted gang

If a Lasting Injury has a Mutation effect, roll a D6 and apply the following modifiers:

- +1 if inflicted by a Chaos Cult, Corpse Grinder Cult or Corrupted gang.
- +1 if the fighter is a Daemon or daemonically possessed.
- +1 if already having mutation(s).

If the result is 6+, the Lasting Injury is replaced by a Mutation. Each mutation can only be gained once. If the mutation is a duplicate, choose another.

When a fighter gain a number of Mutations equal to the Toughness, they become a Chaos Spawn. If the gang is a Chaos Cult, Corpse Grinder Cult or Corrupted gang, it is added to the gang.

:::note
Pets shouldn't be able to gain Mutations. The official rules doesn't prevent this, but it won't work well.
