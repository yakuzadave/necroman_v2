## Being Captured

If only one gang has fighters on the battlefield at the end of a battle, roll 2D6 and add modifiers:

- +1 per enemy fighter taken Out of Action (including those who succumbed to their injuries).
- +1 per friendly hired Bounty Hunter.
- +1 per webbed enemy fighter that went Out of Action.
- +1 per restrained enemy fighter (Enforcer skill).
- +1 per friendly Water Guild fighter not Out of Action if the Master Nautican (Leader) has not gone Out of Action.

### Capture Levels

**Default (Dominion, Uprising & Outlander):** 13+<br />
**Law & Misrule:** 11+

If the result is higher than the capture level, one random fighter that went Out of Action is captured. Critically Injured fighters can't be captured (randomize another fighter).

A captured fighter is unavailable until freed.

**Hired Guns:** Can be sold without any rescue attempt.

### Captured Enemies
Any time the same two gangs fight, the captured fighterâ€™s gang can declare a rescue mission, superseding any step to Determine Scenario. If failed, this can be repeated next battle.

If a gang fails to rescue the Captive, or the gang doesn't want to rescue, the capturing gang can choose any of the following:
- Trade back to the gang (or any other gang that wants the Captive).
- Sell to the Guilders (not Uprising campaign).
- Gain half the cost (rounded up to nearest 5 credits).
- Law Abiding: Claim a bounty on Outlaw Captives.
- Gain the full cost.
- Outlaw: 'Dispose' of the Captive.

Gangs can trade back Captives at any time, regardless of whether a rescue mission has already been attempted. The two gangs can try to negotiate a trade for the Captive. This could be a payment of credits, a trade for another Captive, a Resource, an item, equipment or anything else - this is entirely up to the two gangs, and the capturing gang is free to refuse an offer. If an agreement is reached and the trade is made, the captured fighter is immediately handed over to the other gang.
