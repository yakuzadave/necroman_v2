- Using Skirmish rules.
- Resurrection: No Lasting Injuries.
- First round is random, later rounds uses Swiss draw.

## Tournament Scoring

Each individual battle is won as determined by the scenario. The points scored are as follows:

- Win: 3 points
- Draw: 1 point
- Loss: 0 points

Bonus points may be awarded if certain criteria are met. For example if winning by a large margin, the winner gains +1 point, or if only winning by a minor margin, the loser may gain +1 point.

Further bonuses may be awarded for taking Captives, as this is an integral part of campaign play and should be recognised in tournament play. For example award +1 point whenever they take an enemy fighter Captive.

Use Reputation and Wealth as tiebreakers.

## Campaign Events

Feel free to add Campaign events for less competitive tournaments.

### House War

Gangs of the same type are grouped together, adding requirements to matchups to ensure no gang of the same type fights each other.

### Map-Based Event

Another option, and an expansion of the above, might be to group gangs into different clans who control a map. Over the course of the event, a clan’s territory can shrink or grow based on its member’s wins and losses.
