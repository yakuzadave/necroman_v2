# Resurrection

:::info
You are viewing the archived rules from before the 2023 Core books. Use the menu to navigate to the current rules.
:::

Resurrection Packs are optional rules that can be used when a fighter is killed (Memorable Death or untreated Critical Injury). Resurrection should be restricted to important fighters (for example Leaders and Champions). Players should agree when a fighter can be resurrected and what package to use (choose or randomize). It is recommended that each gang only has a single fighter with a Resurrection Package at a time and fighters only use the option once.

There are a total of 8 Resurrection Packages to choose from. All Resurrection Packages has 3 special rules:

- Benefits
- Price
- End Game

## Resurrection Packs

### 1. Archeo-Rebirth

_A living piece of abominable technology has attached itself to the fighter's body, burrowing mecha-tendrils deep inside the flesh. Whatever dark technology is keeping the fighter alive has also burrowed its way into the brain. Eventually the fighter will become more machine than human and vanish into the underhive, never to be seen again._

#### Benefit

Treat any Lasting Injuries that would reduce a characteristic (46, 51-56) as Out Cold (12-26). Make a note each time a Lasting Injury is avoided this way.

#### Price

When activated, roll a D6. If the result is equal to or less than the total number of times a Lasting Injury has been avoided, gain Insanity.

#### End game

If the fighter has ever avoided 6+ Lasting Injuries (Benefit), the fighter is removed.

### 2. A Debt of Blood

_There are few things that create loyalty like the gift of unexpected life. The moment when souls believe they will plunge into the abyss but then find themselves still hanging by a thread is a moment that the powerful can use to create servants who will be loyal for the rest of their lives. For some it is a gunshot that they thought would end their lives but instead saw their killers dead at the hands of an angel with a smile and an offer. No matter what, a debt of blood is a path back to a life lived still at the end of a string._

#### Benefit

Choose an Alliance (Criminal, Guild or Noble). The gang immediately enters into this alliance, forsaking all other allies. The gang will always have this alliance while the resurrected fighter is alive. Fighters gained from the allies:

- Ignore the Band Apart rules.
- Count as part of the resurrected fighter's gang.
- Gain experience and suffer Lasting Injuries.

#### Price

- Must change alignment to match that of the alliance.
- Can never voluntarily Test the Alliance.

:::danger House Rule
Only use alliances the gang could normally take.
:::

#### End Game

After each won battle, a fighter is removed from the gang (joins the allies). This can be the resurrected fighter or any other fighter (except hired guns or allied fighters).

### 3. Daemonic Possession

_There is a supernatural horror that emanates from the fighter, infecting all around them. The Daemon within the fighter demands souls as it gets stronger. Once the Daemon has consumed its weak mortal vessel, it will no longer need the fighter and it breaks free. It is the will of the Dark Gods to bestow terrible gifts upon the servants._

#### Benefit

- Gain the [Fearsome](/docs/gang-fighters-and-their-weaponry/skills/#2-fearsome) skill (if not having it).
- Enemy fighters must pass a Cool test to target this fighter with ranged weapons.
- Become Unsanctioned Psyker.
- Can generate a random psychic power from the Chaos Cult psychic powers list.

#### Price

After every battle (whether the fighter took part or not), at least one of the following must be done:

- The fighter performed a Coup de Grace (during the battle).
- Sacrifice a friendly fighter (as if suffering a Memorable Death).
- Lose 1 Toughness.

The fighter dies for good when the Toughness is reduced to 0.

#### End Game

Each time the fighter takes a soul (performs a Coup de Grace or sacrifices a friendly fighter), make a note. After each battle, before deciding whether or not to sacrifice a friendly fighter, roll 2D6. If the result is equal to or lower than the number of souls the fighter has consumed, the fighter is immediately killed (as the Daemon breaks free).

### 4. Dark Pact

_There are things that listen to the dreams and fears of mortals, things that live beyond the shadow line that separates reality from that which lies beyond. Some call these things gods, others call them Daemons. In the depths of Hive Primus there are those that whisper of the Seven Pale Spinners, the Burning Ones, the Lord of Skin and Sinew and the Horned Darkness. No matter their name, or why mortals call to them, there is one truth to them: they listen. And should a lost soul desire to live beyond their allotted span, the Daemons and gods can grant that last wish â€¦ for a price._

#### Benefit

- Can perform a Dark Ritual (post-battle action) (as if part of a Chaos Cult).
- If already part of a Chaos Cult, the fighter can add +2 to the result.
- Become Unsanctioned Psyker.
- Generate a random psychic power from the Chaos Cult psychic powers list.

#### Price

The gang can't sell Captives to the Guild and must instead sacrifice them to the Dark Gods just like a Chaos Cult. If already a Chaos Cult, this has no effect.
The gang immediately becomes Outlaws.

#### End Game

After sacrificing 3 Captives, the fighter is transformed into a Spawn (the gang can retain it as if a Chaos Cult).

### 5. Cannibal Corpse

_The fighter is inexorably driven to create more zombies. Eventually the entire egang will be disbanded, and all zombies wander off into the underhive looking for fresh meat..._

#### Benefit

- Can't be Pinned.
- Ignores Flesh Wounds.
- Automatically passes any Cool tests.
- Can activate normally while ablaze (still takes damage).

:::danger House Rule
When randomising new zombies, randomise from fighters who are not currently zombies!
:::

#### Price

- Can only ever perform a single action in each activation.
- -4 hit modifier (except Melee or Versatile).
- Must Charge or Coup de Grace if able.
- Can't perform Group Activations with fighters who are not also zombies.

#### End Game

- After each battle, one random fighter in the gang becomes a zombie.
- Zombies can't be deleted from the gang during the post-battle sequence.
- The gang is disbanded once all fighters are zombies.

### 6. Revenant

_Revenge is a power that can deny the dead the peace of the grave. Driven by immortal hate, the revenant is a figure who lives again to perform one deed alone: to pull those that wronged them into death with them._

#### Benefit

Note down which enemy fighter responsible for the resurrected fighter's death. If the fighter wasn't killed by an enemy fighter, choose the Leader of the enemy gang the resurrected fighter was facing when dying. The resurrected fighter can re-roll failed hit and wound rolls, as well as injury dice, when attacking the chosen enemy.

#### Price

The fighter must try to kill their killer. Each time the gang doesn't face the enemy's gang in a battle (whether or not the chosen enemy is part of the opponent's crew), roll a 4+ or lose 1 Strength. The fighter dies for good when the Strength is reduced to 0.

#### End Game

If the resurrected fighter kills the chosen enemy (Memorable Death or untreated Critical Injury), the fighter retires and is removed from the gang. If the enemy is killed by someone else or retires, choose a new fighter from the enemy gang instead to be the chosen enemy.

### 7. Xenos-resurrection

_There are always ways back from death open to those who are willing to leave their humanity behind. Each time an injury is avoided, the fighter becomes more alien. Eventually the fighter's humanity is consumed by the alien within and the fighter becomes something else entirely._

#### Benefit

All Lasting Injuries except Memorable Death and Critical Injury counts as Out Cold (12-26) instead. Make a note each time a Lasting Injury is avoided this way.

#### Price

Each time a Lasting Injury is avoided, apply the following cumulative effects:

- **1:** Can't use or benefit from Leading By Example.
- **2:** Can't make or take part in Group Activations.
- **3:** Can't be targeted by friendly Tactics.
- **4+:** Other friendly fighters can never voluntarily be deployed or move within 3" of this fighter.

#### End Game

After surviving 4+ Lasting Injuries (since being resurrected), each time a new Lasting Injury is suffered, roll 2D6. If the result is equal to or lower than the current number of survived Lasting Injuries, the fighter immediately transforms into a Beast's Lair (or a different creature if other players agree), and will always attack the nearest fighters (friend & foe) on their activation (or move towards the nearest fighter if transforming into a different creature). After the battle, the fighter is permanently removed.

### 8. Skin-deep Doppelganger

_The fighter is not quite the same and is following a personal secret agenda. Other members of the gang are a little unnerved by the Doppelganger. Remorphic aliens, witch-bred assassins, neuro-mimic cultists and other shape-changers may take the death of an individual as an opportunity to slip into the space left by the departed._

#### Benefit

When resurrected, the fighter can alter any skill advances already received, effectively gaining back any spent experience points on skills and spending them again on new skills. When choosing skills (including the starting skill for Leader or Champion), choose from any skill category (not limited to those available to the gang).

#### Price

- Can't make or take part in Group Activations.
- Can't use or benefit from Leading By Example.

#### End Game

After each battle the fighter takes part in, roll 3D6. If a double is rolled, the fighter goes Into Recovery (disappears for a battle). If a triple is rolled, the fighter is removed from the gang (vanishes entirely).
