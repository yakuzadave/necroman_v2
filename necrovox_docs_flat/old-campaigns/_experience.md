# Experience

You are viewing the archived rules from before the 2023 Core books. Use the menu to navigate to the current rules.
:::

### Gaining Experience

There are some standard ways of gaining Experience (scenarios can offer additional ways):

- 1 XP for each enemy (fighter or vehicle) taken Out of Action. This must be a direct cause during an activation (for example setting a booby trap which later takes an enemy Out of Action would not count). A single attack that takes multiple enemies Out of Action grants multiple XP (for example Blast).
  - +1 XP if taking Leaders & Champions Out of Action.
  - +1 XP for killing an enemy.
- 1 XP for Rallying (does not apply to pets that automatically rally after running back to the owner).

:::danger House Rule (A&A)
Additonal ways to earn XP:

- D3 XP for the MVP of each playing team. This is nominated by your opponent at the end of the match.
- D3 XP for each fully painted model. This is awarded at the start of the campaign (or when they join your gang). If a model is unpainted, it gains the D3XP when it becomes painted.
- +1 additional XP when taking a Brute Out of Action.

:::

## Advancements

Spend XP to gain Advancements. Update the fighter’s Advancements with 1 per purchase. The cost of each characteristic Advancement of the same type taken is increased by 2XP for each Advancement of that type the fighter already has.

### Starting Advancement

Note that Leaders and Champions start with 1 Advancement as they have an initial skill. This is free and does not affect cost or Gang Rating.

### Fast Learner

Juve and Juve (Specialist) ignore the additional cost of advancements and always use the cost shown in the table, regardless of the number of identical characteristic Advancements they have (up to the maximum).

### Promotions

- Promotions are always optional.
- If a gang has a hard limit on a fighter class, no fighters can be promoted to that class until the gang has available slots.
- A fighter can can keep any current equipment (even if it breaks any restrictions of the new fighter class), but can only gain new equipment according to the new class restrictions.
- Access to the old skill set (if any) is replaced by access to the new skill set.
- Characteristics and value (rating) are unaffected.
- Treated as the new fighter type in all respects.
- Any special rules for the old class are lost and any special rules for the new class are gained.

:::tip YAQ
The fighter keeps improved stats above the new class maximum characteristics (for example Movement). However, if the fighter (after promotion) later receives stat decrease injury bringing them back to the current class max, the fighter will forever be unable to go above the max again (with future advancements or bionics).
:::

Examples:

- A Corpse Grinder Cult Juve can only be promoted to Champion if the gang has less than 3 Champions (the gang can have 0-3 Champions).
- A Corpse Grinder Cult Juve promoted to Champion lose Infiltration (Infiltrate skill) and gains Dervish.

### Juve

Can be Promoted during Downtime (phase 2) if having 5+ Advancements (unless otherwise specified).

Juve → Ganger (Specialist)

### Juve (Specialist)

Can be Promoted during Downtime (phase 2) if having 5+ Advancements (unless otherwise noted).

Juve (Specialist) → Champion (any)

### Gangers

Gangers gain Advancements during the pre-match sequence if they have reached 6 XP. Spend 6 XP to roll 2D6 and see what Ganger Advancement they get. Update their value accordingly.

Ganger → Ganger (Specialist)

### Ganger (Specialist)

When becoming a Ganger (Specialist), the fighter is a Ganger for all rules purposes, but spend Experience and gain Advancements in the same way as any other non-ganger.

Ganger (Specialist) → Champion (any)

### Minimum/Maximum Characteristics

Each stat has a maximum value. If a roll on the Advancement table for a Ganger has no option but to increase a Characteristic beyond its maximum, treat it as a roll of 12 instead.

### Skills

Skills can be obtained by the following fighters:

- Leader.
- Champion (including Specialist).
- Juve (including Specialist).
- Ganger (Specialist only).
- Crew.

Skill access is divided into 2 types:

- Primary (easiest to gain).
- Secondary (higher cost).

To determine a random skill, declare a set and roll a D6 to see which skill is gained. Re-roll if the fighter already has that skill or cannot take that skill. When gaining skills that are not random, simply choose one from a relevant set.
