# Hangers-On And Brutes

Once a gang establishes itself, its hideout can become
as well known as any other local landmark. Some
gangs’ hideouts become centres of activity, with loyal
hivers granted the freedom to come and go as they
please, while others are more like fortresses. In either
case, they are sought-after destinations for merchants
and tradesmen seeking a reliable base of operations
and offering their services to the gang.

Hangers-on are primarily used in Campaign play, although some will prove particularly useful in Skirmish
play. Brutes are purchased specifically to add some
extra muscle and prowess on the battlefield and can
be fielded alongside the rest of the gang normally. Either at gang creation or in the Update Roster step of
the post-battle sequence, players can recruit Hangers- on and Brutes. These are purchased with credits from
the gang’s Stash in the same way as new fighters. A
Fighter card is filled out for each and they are added
to the gang roster. Most Hangers-on and Brutes have
various options for their equipment – these must
be decided when they are recruited and cannot be
changed later.

During Campaign play, both Hangers-on and Brutes
can be taken captive in the post-battle sequence,
just like any other fighter. In such cases, the gang
can attempt to rescue them or make a trade with
the captor to have them returned. Should they fail to
rescue them or secure a trade, the captor may sell
them as if they were a normal fighter.

The maximum number of Hangers-oFn and Brutes a
gang can have is limited by its Reputation, as shown
by the table below. If a gang’s Reputation drops to the
point that it does not have enough for its Hangers-on
or Brutes, it must remove one or more of them from
its roster until it is back within the limit. Also, note that
there is a limit on each type of Hanger-on and Brute –
a gang can have up to two Rogue Docs, but only one
Dome Runner, for example. Hangers-on and Brutes do
not count towards the number of fighters in the gang
for the purposes of determining how many fighters of
other types the gang may contain.

| Reputation | Maximum Hangers-on and Brutes |
| :--------: | :---------------------------: |
|    1-4     |               1               |
|    5-9     |               2               |
|   10-14    |               3               |
|   15-19    |               4               |
|    20+     |               5               |

## Hangers-On

Each of the different types of Hanger-on brings a
specific benefit or a special rule to the gang that
employs them. Hangers-on do not normally take part
in battles; their role is a non-combat one. However, should a battle take place on the gang’s own turf
(i.e., when the gang has the Home Turf Advantage
in a scenario), roll a D6 for each Hanger-on before
choosing a crew. On a roll of 1, 2 or 3, the Hanger-on
is unfortunate enough to be around when the fighting
starts, and must be included as part of the crew.

Hangers-on cannot gain Experience or Advancements;
if they suffer a Lasting Injury that would make a change
to their Fighter card, they decide that the hideout is no
longer safe and move on – they are removed from the
gang roster. They cannot be given any equipment other
than what is listed.

## Brutes

Unlike other Hangers-on, Brutes are purchased with
the express intention that they be fielded in battle and
are treated like any other fighter when selecting a crew. Unlike other Hangers-on, Brutes will gain Experience
and Advancements in the same manner as a Specialist
(see [Experience: Gangers](/docs/the-rules/gaining-experience#gangers)). Unlike Hangers-on, Brutes will not
leave the gang should they suffer a Lasting Injury that
makes a change to their Fighter card.
