## Vehicle Characteristic Profiles

Similar to fighters, each vehicle has a ‘characteristics profile’, which details its strengths and weaknesses. For example, here is the profile for a Goliath Road Thug driving a Goliath Mauler:

<table>

        <tr>
            <td colSpan="7">Vehicle Characteristics</td>
            <td colSpan="5">Crew Characteristics</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td></td>
            <td colSpan="3">Toughness</td>
            <td colSpan="3"></td>
            <td colSpan="5"></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>M</td>
            <td>Front</td>
            <td>Side</td>
            <td>Rear</td>
            <td>HP</td>
            <td>Hnd</td>
            <td>Sv</td>
            <td>BS</td>
            <td>Ld</td>
            <td>Cl</td>
            <td>Wil</td>
            <td>Int</td>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>7"</td> 
            <td>5 </td>
            <td>4 </td>
            <td>4 </td>
            <td>3 </td>
            <td>5+</td> 
            <td>5+</td> 
            <td>4+</td> 
            <td>8+</td> 
            <td>5+</td> 
            <td>9+</td> 
            <td>8+</td>
        </tr>

Vehicle Profiles appear slightly differently on Necrodamus, for sake of brevity.

## Example Vehicle

| M   | Front | Side | Rear | HP  | Hnd | Sv  |
| --- | ----- | ---- | ---- | --- | --- | --- |
| 7"  | 5     | 4    | 4    | 3   | 5+  | 5+  |

</div>

</VehicleCard>

:::

Each of these characteristics represents a different trait or attribute of either the vehicle itself or of its crew, and
each characteristic is used differently within the game. In some cases a low number is better, but in other cases, a high number is better:

- Movement (M), Toughness (Front, Side and Rear) and Hull Points (HP) are all shown as simple numbers, in which case a higher number is better.
- Save (Sv), Ballistic Skill (BS) and Handling (Hnd) are all shown as target numbers; a number followed by a ‘+’ symbol, as described in [Rolling Dice](/docs/general-principles/rolling-dice). In which case, a lower number is better.

In addition, a vehicle card will have all four psychology characteristics assigned to it, just like a fighter;
Leadership (Ld), Cool (Cl), Willpower (Wil) and Intelligence (Int). In the case of a vehicle, these represent the
psychological traits of the crew rather than the vehicle itself. These are also all shown as target numbers;
a number followed by a ‘+’ symbol. In the case of all four psychology characteristics, a lower number is better.

During Campaign play, characteristics may be improved or reduced as vehicles are upgraded and as the crew
gains experience or suffers injuries. No characteristic may ever be improved beyond the maximum shown on the
table below. No characteristic may ever be reduced below the minimum shown on the table below:

#### Vehicle Characteristics

|         |  M  | Front | Side | Rear | HP  | Hnd | Sv  |
| :-----: | :-: | :---: | :--: | :--: | :-: | --- | --- |
| **Max** | 12" |  10   |  10  |  10  |  8  | 3+  | 2+  |
| **Min** | 1"  |   3   |  3   |  3   |  1  | 10+ | 6+  |

#### Crew Characteristics

|         | BS  | Ld  | Cl  | Wil | Int |
| :-----: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| **Max** | 2+  | 3+  | 3+  | 3+  | 3+  |
| **Min** | 6+  | 10+ | 10+ | 10+ | 10+ |

## Vehicle Characteristics & Characteristic Tests

A vehicle’s characteristics are defined as follows:

### Movement (M)

This is the distance, in inches, the vehicle can move
when making a standard Move action.

### Toughness (Front, Side, Rear)

All vehicles have three Toughness characteristics:
Front, Side and Rear, corresponding to their vision arcs
(see [Vehicle Vision Arcs](/docs/general-principles/line-of-sight-and-cover#vehicle-vision-arcs)). This shows how sturdily built a vehicle
is; the higher a vehicle’s Toughness characteristic, the
less likely it is to be damaged by an attack.

### Hull Points (Hp)

A vehicle’s Hull Points characteristic is a measure
of how much punishment it can sustain before it
is Wrecked.

### Handling (Hnd)

This represents how manoeuvrable a vehicle is and
how responsive it is to the crew’s commands. Handling
is used to avoid damage from dangerous terrain, maintain control after suffering damage, and when
attempting to Restart a Stalled vehicle.

### Save (Sv)

This indicates how heavily armoured a vehicle is.

### Ballistic Skill (Bs)

This characteristic represents the proficiency of the
vehicle’s crew with ranged weapons fitted to
the vehicle.

### Leadership (Ld)

A vehicle’s Leadership characteristic represents the
ability of its crew to issue or follow commands in the
heat of battle.

### Cool (Cl)

A vehicle’s Cool characteristic represents the capacity
of its crew for keeping calm under fire.

### Willpower (Wil)

Willpower is a measure of the crew’s mental fortitude
and resilience against the horrors of Necromunda.

### Intelligence (Int)

This represents the mental acuity and ability of the
crew to apply knowledge.

### Modifying Characteristics

Sometimes, the rules will modify a characteristic. If the
characteristic is given as a simple number, the modifier
is applied as written – for example, if a vehicle with
a Front Toughness of 6 is given a +1 modifier to its
Toughness, its Front Toughness counts as 7.

If the characteristic is given as a target number
(for example, a characteristic of 4+ means a dice roll
of 4 or higher would be a success), the modifier is
applied to the dice roll rather than the characteristic.

### Characteristic Tests

Players will often be called on to make a characteristic
test for a vehicle – for example, a Ballistic Skill test is
made when a vehicle attacks with a ranged weapon. Characteristics tests are made as follows:

- Ballistic Skill tests are made by making a target number roll on a single D6 (as described in [Rolling Dice](/docs/general-principles/rolling-dice)). If the result is equal to or higher than the characteristic, the test is passed.
- Handling, Leadership, Cool, Willpower and Intelligence tests are made by making a target number roll on 2D6. If the result is equal to or higher than the characteristic, the test is passed.
- To check against a vehicle’s Toughness, roll a D6. If the result is less than or equal to the Toughness characteristic for that facing, the check is passed. A natural roll of a 6 is always a fail.

## Vehicle Cards

As with fighters, each vehicle within a player’s gang is represented by a model on the
battlefield and a Vehicle card filled in with their characteristics, upgrades, special
rules and other useful reference information. Blank Vehicle cards with the logo of
each House can be found in the various Gang Tactics card packs.

Each Vehicle card is split into several areas:

1. The vehicle’s name.
2. The vehicle’s type.
3. The vehicle’s cost, in credits.
4. The vehicle’s characteristics. The last five (BS, Ld, Cl, Wil, Int) are shaded as a reminder that they are the characteristics of the crew rather than the physical characteristics of the vehicle (see [Vehicle Profiles](/docs/gang-fighters-and-their-weaponry/vehicle-profiles)).
5. The weapons the vehicle is equipped with.
6. Any special rules the vehicle has, as described in its entry in the gang list.
7. Any upgrades the vehicle has been equipped with.
8. Any Wargear the vehicle has been equipped with.
