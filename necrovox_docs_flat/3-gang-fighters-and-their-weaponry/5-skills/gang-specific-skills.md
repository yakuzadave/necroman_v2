### 1. Lord of the Rats

Friendly Juve (or Prospect) fighters that are within 12"
of this fighter and can draw line of sight to them may
apply a +2 modifier to their Cool checks and Willpower
checks. Rats, including Necromunda Rats, Bomb
Delivery Rats and any rats that feature in a battle due
to a scenario or environment special rule, that end
their movement within 3" of the fighter are immediately
moved by the smallest amount possible so they are at
least 3" away from the fighter.

### 2. Scavenger's Eye

During any scenario that features loot markers,
scrap or any kind of harvested goods that are then
transformed into credits at the end of the battle, the
fighter’s gang may add an additional +1 to the dice roll
for determining their worth. For example, if a scenario
called for the gathering of loot and each loot marker
held by the gang at the end of the battle was worth
D3x10 credits, then each one would grant the fighter’s
gang (D3+1)x10 credits.

### 3. Blazing Faith

Should this fighter ever become subject to the Blaze
condition, they may continue to act normally rather
than acting as determined by the Trait and the
condition – though they may still suffer damage each
time they activate as normal. In addition, this fighter
ignores the effects of the Insanity condition.

### 4. Unshakable Conviction

This fighter may make reaction attacks while Seriously
Injured and cannot be the target of a Coup De Grace
(Simple) action. In addition, whilst Seriously Injured
this fighter may perform the Flock Together (Double)
action:

**Flock Together (Double):** This fighter may move a
distance equal to their Movement characteristic plus
D3", provided they move directly towards a friendly
House Cawdor fighter.

### 5. Devotional Frenzy

When this fighter is activated, their controlling player
may declare they will use this skill. Until the start of
their next activation, improve their Weapon Skill, Cool,
Leadership and Willpower characteristics by D3, rolling
separately for each characteristic. At the end of their
activation, the fighter immediately suffers an automatic
Damage 1 hit which cannot be saved. Devotional
Frenzy can only be declared once per round.

### 6. Restless Faith

During the Choose Crew step of the pre-battle
sequence, this fighter may be taken out of Recovery
(see the Necromunda Rulebook) and included in the
deck of available fighters. If this is done and the fighter
takes part in the battle, they begin the battle with a
single Flesh Wound.

## Obfuscation

_Source: House of Shadows_

### 1. Faceless

From the start of each round until after this fighter has
activated, enemy fighters must pass a Willpower check
to target them with a ranged attack, or place a Blast
marker so that it is touching their base. If the check is
failed, the enemy fighter may choose another target.

### 2. Psi-touched

The fighter may re-roll Willpower checks when
attempting to activate Wyrd Powers or to resist them.
When visiting the Black Market as part of the postbattle
sequence, the fighter may always choose
to purchase Ghast without the need to make an
Availability roll.

### 3. Take Down

When this fighter takes an enemy fighter Out of Action,
place that enemy fighter to one side. At the end of the
battle, if this fighter’s gang has won the scenario, then
instead of using the normal method for determining if
enemy fighters are captured, roll a D6 for each enemy
fighter that was taken Out of Action and placed aside
by this fighter. On a 4+, this fighter has the choice of
automatically capturing that enemy fighter. As normal,
a gang cannot capture more than a single fighter after
a battle.

### 4. Rumour-monger

The fighter can perform the Despicable Rumours postbattle
action during the post-battle actions step of the
post-battle sequence:

**Despicable Rumours:** Make an Intelligence check
for the fighter. If they pass, reduce the Reputation
of the gang(s) they just faced by D3 and increase
the Reputation of this fighter’s own gang by an
equal amount.

### 5. Fake Out

When making the roll to determine the scenario during
the pre-battle sequence, this fighter’s gang may roll
three D6 rather than the usual two. One of these dice
(chosen by the player) must be discarded.

### 6. Doppelganger

During the Select Crews step of the pre-battle
sequence, this fighter’s gang may attempt to
include an extra fighter than normally allowed by the
scenario. Have the leader of the enemy gang make an
Intelligence check. If they fail, this fighter’s gang may
include one extra fighter in their starting crew.

## Finesse

_Source: House of Blades_

### 1. Acrobatic

While this fighter is Active, they may ignore enemy
fighters when making a Move (Simple) action or a
Charge (Double) action. In effect, this allows them
to move over other fighters. Note that they must
still adhere to the 1" rule once their movement is
complete. This fighter may also cross any barricade or
linear terrain feature up to 2" high without a reduction
in movement.

### 2. Combat Focus

For every enemy fighter either Out of Action or
Seriously Injured, place a token on this fighter’s Fighter
card. This fighter adds 1 to their Willpower and Cool
checks for each token on their Fighter card. Note that a
result of 2 for either a Willpower or Cool check is still a
failure regardless of modifiers.

### 3. Combat Virtuoso

Any chainswords, fighting knives, power knives, power
swords, stiletto knives and stiletto swords wielded by
this fighter gain the Versatile trait with a Long range
equal to this fighter’s Strength characteristic.

### 4. Hit & Run

After making a Charge (Double) action, this fighter
may make a Retreat (Basic) action for free before their
opponent makes any reaction attacks. Note that even
if the Retreat action is unsuccessful, this fighter’s
opponent may only make reaction attacks once.

### 5. Lightning Reflexes

When this fighter is Engaged by an enemy fighter, this
fighter may attempt to make a Retreat (Basic) action
for free before the enemy fighter makes any attacks or
additional actions.

Whether or not the Retreat action was successful, this
fighter may only use this skill once per round. Note
that if this fighter has a Ready marker, they may still
activate as normal.

### 6. Somersault

This fighter gains the ability to perform the Somersault
(Basic) action while they are Standing and Active:

**Somersault (Basic):** Place the fighter anywhere
within 6" of their current position, provided they can
see the point they wish to move to before they are
placed. Note that the fighter must still adhere to the
1" rule when being placed. Using this action does not
count as moving for the purposes of effects that are
triggered by movement and for the firing of weapons
with the Unwieldy trait.

## Muscle

_Source: House of Chains_

### 1. Fists of Steel

Unarmed attacks made by this fighter count as having
a Strength 2 higher than normal and inflict 2 damage.

### 2. Iron Man

This fighter’s Toughness is not reduced by Flesh
Wounds. However, if this fighter suffers a number of
Flesh Wounds equal to their Toughness characteristic,
they will go Out of Action as normal.

### 3. Immovable Stance

This fighter may perform the Tank (Double) action
during their activation:

**Tank (Double):** Until the start of this fighter’s next
activation, this fighter increases their armour save by
2 to a maximum of 2+ and cannot be moved from
their current location by any skills such as Hurl or
Overseer, or any weapon traits such as Knockback or
Drag, nor can they be Pinned.

### 4. Naaargah!

During this fighter’s activation they may attempt to
perform a third action after completing their first two.
Roll a D6. If the dice roll is equal to or less than their
Toughness then they perform the action. If the roll is
greater than their Toughness, or is a 6, their activation
ends immediately. Whether or not they were
successful, when their activation ends, this fighter is
automatically Pinned (this Pinning cannot be negated
by skills such as [Nerves of Steel](/docs/gang-fighters-and-their-weaponry/skills/#4-nerves-of-steel)).


### 5. Unleash the Beast

This fighter may perform the Flex (Simple) action
while they are Active and Engaged:

**Flex (Simple):** All fighters (friend or foe) in base
contact with this fighter must pass a Strength check
or be pushed D3" directly away from this fighter,
stopping only if they come into contact with another
fighter or an impassable terrain feature. If there are
multiple enemies being pushed, the player controlling
this fighter chooses in which order they are moved.

### 6. Walk It Off

Should this fighter perform two or more Move
(Simple) actions during their activation, they can
make a Toughness check at the end of their activation.
If this check is passed, this fighter may recover one
lost Wound or discard a single Flesh Wound.

## Bravado

### 1. Big Brother

Whilst this fighter is Standing and Active, any friendly
fighter with the Gang Fighter (X) special rule that is
within 9" and line of sight of this fighter may use this
fighter’s Cool characteristic for Nerve tests instead of
their own.

### 2. Bring it on!

The fighter gains the ability to make the Issue Challenge
(Basic) action:

**Issue Challenge (Basic):** Choose an enemy fighter
within 12". Until the end of this round, or until the
chosen fighter is attacked by a friendly fighter,
they must make a Willpower check if they wish to
make a ranged or close combat attack that targets
any fighter other than the fighter who issued the
challenge (fighters that have been challenged ignore
the normal rules for target priority as detailed in the
Necromunda Rulebook).

### 3. Guilder Contacts

Any Bounty Hunters and Hive Scum hired by this fighter’s gang will reduce their hiring fee by D6x10 credits to a minimum of 20 credits. Roll separately for each Bounty Hunter and Hive Scum hired.

### 4. King Hit

When making an unarmed attack this fighter may choose to roll a single Attack dice, irrespective of their Attacks characteristic or any
other bonuses. If they choose to do so, the attack gains the Knockback, Shock, Pulverise and Concussion traits.

### 5. Shotgun Savant

When armed with a shotgun of any type (including
combat shotguns and sawn-off shotguns), this fighter
may choose to use the shotgun’s Short range Accuracy
modifier when making shots at Long range. In addition,
when rolling the dice to determine the number of hits
from a shotgun with the Scattershot trait, this fighter
may roll two D6 and choose the highest.

### 6. Steady Hands

When this fighter is activated, before declaring their first
action, this fighter may perform a Reload (Simple) action
for free. This does not prevent them from performing the
same action once or twice more during their activation
should they choose.

## Tech

### 1. Cold & Calculating

Once per round, when making a Cool or Willpower
check, this fighter may make the check against their
Intelligence characteristic instead.

### 2. Gadgeteer

If this fighter is in the starting crew, prior to the first
turn, they may modify the Weapon Traits of any weapon
they carry that has the Plentiful trait. If they do so, until
the end of the battle the weapon loses the Plentiful
trait and gains one of the following, as chosen by the
controlling player: Knockback, Pulverise, Rending or
Shock. Alternatively, a Plentiful weapon with the Rapid
Fire (X) trait can add one to the X value. E.g., a Rapid
Fire (1) would become Rapid Fire (2).

### 3. Mental Mastery

This fighter cannot become subject to the Insane
condition. In addition, if this fighter is chosen as the
target of a Wyrd Power, and is Standing and Active or
Prone and Pinned, they may attempt to Disrupt the
power as if they were a Psyker.

### 4. Photonic Engineer

This fighter may apply a +1 modifier to the Strength
characteristic of all las weapons used by them. Doing
so, however, causes the weapon to gain the Unstable
trait. In addition, this fighter may re-roll failed Ammo
checks with las weaponry, provided the weapon does
not have the Unstable trait.

### 5. Rad-phaged

When this fighter is hit by a weapon with the Gas or
Toxin traits, the opposing player must roll two D6 and
discard the highest roll when rolling to see if this fighter
is affected.

In addition, should this fighter suffer a hit from a
weapon with the Rad-phage trait, roll an additional
D6 as normal. However, on a roll of 4 or higher, they
do not suffer an additional Flesh Wound. Instead, the
fighter may discard a Flesh Wound they have already
suffered.

Finally, in any scenario that uses the Pitch Black rules,
this fighter always counts as being Revealed.

### 6. Weaponsmith

Any weapons this fighter is equipped with lose the
Scarce trait if it has it. Any weapons this fighter is
equipped with will gain the Plentiful trait if it does not
have the Scarce trait. Weapons that already have the
Plentiful trait gain no additional benefit from this skill.
