# Fighter Profiles

## Fighter Characteristics Profiles

Each fighter has a ‘characteristics profile’, which details their capabilities in battle. For example, here is the profile
for an Orlock Gunner:

|  M  | WS  | BS  |  S  |  T  |  W  |  I  |  A  | Ld  | Cl  | Wil | Int |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 5"  | 4+  | 4+  |  3  |  3  |  1  | 4+  |  1  | 6+  | 7+  | 7+  | 7+  |

Each of these characteristics represents a different trait or attribute, and each characteristic is used differently
within the game. In some cases a low number is better, but in other cases, a high number is better:

- Movement (M), Strength (S), Toughness (T), Wounds (W) and Attacks (A) are all shown as simple numbers, in which case a higher number is better.
- Weapon Skill (WS), Ballistic Skill (BS) and Initiative (I) are all shown as target numbers; a number followed by a ‘+’ symbol, as described in [Fighter Characteristics](/docs/gang-fighters-and-their-weaponry/fighter-profiles#fighter-characteristics--characteristic-tests). In the case of WS, BS and I, a lower number is better.
- In addition, all four of a fighter’s psychology characteristics, those contained within the shaded section of their profile: Leadership (Ld), Cool (Cl), Willpower (Wil) and Intelligence (Int), are also all shown as target numbers; a number followed by a ‘+’ symbol. In the case of all four psychology characteristics, a lower number is better.

During Campaign play, characteristics may be improved or reduced as fighters gain experience and suffer injuries. No characteristic may ever be improved beyond the maximum shown on the table below. No characteristic may
ever be reduced below the minimum shown on the table below.

|         |  M  | WS  | BS  |  S  |  T  |  W  |  I  |  A  | Ld  | Cl  | Wil | Int |
| :------ | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| **Max** | 8"  | 2+  | 2+  |  6  |  6  |  6  | 2+  | 10  | 3+  | 3+  | 3+  | 3+  |
| **Min** | 1"  | 6+  | 6+  |  1  |  1  |  1  | 6+  |  1  | 10+ | 10+ | 10+ | 10+ |

In addition to these maximums, no fighter may improve their Movement, Strength or Toughness characteristics
more than twice beyond that given in the basic profile for a fighter of their current type. No fighter may improve
their Wounds or Attacks characteristics more than once beyond that given in the basic profile for a fighter of their
current type.

Players should note, however, that this does not mean these characteristics cannot be improved by more than 1
or 2 throughout a fighter’s career. During Campaign play, many fighters are eligible for promotion, causing their
category to change.

## Fighter Characteristics & Characteristic Tests

A fighter’s characteristics are defined as follows:

### Movement (M)

This is the distance, in inches, the fighter can move
when making a standard Move action.

### Weapon Skill (WS)

This shows the fighter’s proficiency in close combat
when using weapons that have either the Melee trait or
the Sidearm trait.

### Ballistic Skill (BS)

This characteristic represents the fighter’s proficiency
with ranged weapons.

### Strength (S)

How strong the fighter is. The higher a fighter’s
Strength characteristic, the more likely they are to
inflict damage on an opponent in close combat,
for example.

### Toughness (T)

This represents how tough the fighter is. The higher a
fighter’s Toughness characteristic, the less likely they
are to be wounded by an attack.

### Wounds (W)

A fighter’s Wounds characteristic is a measure of how
much punishment they can take before succumbing to
their injuries.

### Initiative (I)

A fighter’s Initiative characteristic provides a measure
of their agility and dexterity, and the quickness of
their reflexes.

### Attacks (A)

This is a measure of a fighter’s speed and ability in
melee. When a fighter is engaged in close combat,
their Attacks characteristic determines how many dice
are rolled, with each dice representing one attack
made against their enemies.

### Leadership (Ld)

A fighter’s Leadership characteristic represents
their ability to issue or follow commands in the heat
of battle.

### Cool (Cl)

A fighter’s Cool characteristic represents their capacity
for keeping calm under fire.

### Willpower (Wil)

Willpower is a measure of a fighter’s mental fortitude
and resilience against the horrors of Necromunda.

### Intelligence (Int)

This represents a fighter’s mental acuity and ability to
apply knowledge.

### Modifying Characteristics

Sometimes, the rules will modify a characteristic.
If the characteristic is given a simple number, the
modifier is applied as written – for example, if a fighter
with Strength 3 is given a +1 Strength modifier, their
Strength counts as 4.

If the characteristic is given as a target number
(for example, a characteristic of 4+ means a dice roll
of 4 or higher would be a success) the modifier is
applied to the dice roll, rather than the characteristic.
For example, if a fighter with Initiative 4+ is given a
+1 Initiative modifier, the characteristic would be 3+
because a roll of 3 with a +1 modifier applied becomes
a roll of 4.

### Characteristic Tests

Players will often be called on to make a characteristic
test for a fighter – for example, a Ballistic Skill test is
made when a fighter attacks with a ranged weapon. Characteristics tests are made as follows:

- Weapon Skill, Ballistic Skill and Initiative tests are made by achieving a target number roll on a single D6 (see [Rolling Dice](/docs/general-principles/rolling-dice)). If the result is equal to or higher than the characteristic, the test is passed.
- Leadership, Cool, Willpower and Intelligence tests are made by achieving a target number roll on 2D6. If the result is equal to or higher than the characteristic, the test is passed.

To check against a characteristic presented as a
simple number, such as Strength or Toughness, roll a D6. If the result is equal to or lower than the
characteristic, the check is passed.

## Fighter Cards

Each fighter within a player’s gang is represented by a model on the battlefield and a
Fighter card filled in with their characteristics, equipment and other useful reference
information. Blank Fighter cards with the logo of each House can be found in the
various Gang Tactics cards packs, perfect for Leaders and Champions.

Each Fighter card is split into several areas:

1. The fighter’s name. If they are a Leader or Champion, it will also be shown here.
2. The fighter’s cost, in credits.
3. The fighter’s characteristics. The last four (Ld, Cl, Wil, Int) are shaded as a reminder that they are psychological characteristics rather than physical (see [Fighter Profiles](/docs/gang-fighters-and-their-weaponry/fighter-profiles)).
4. The weapons the fighter is carrying.
5. Any skills the fighter may have.
6. Any equipment (including armour) carried by the fighter.
