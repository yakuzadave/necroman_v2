## Weapon Profiles

In the same way as a fighter, each weapon has its own characteristics profile, detailing the range of its attacks, the damage it deals and so forth. For example, here is the profile of a heavy stubber:

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <td></td>
            <td colspan="2">Range</td>
            <td colspan="2">Accuracy</td>
            <td colspan="7"></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Weapon</td>
            <td>S</td>
            <td>L</td>
            <td>S</td>
            <td>L</td>
            <td>S</td>
            <td>AP</td>
            <td>D</td>
            <td>Am</td>
            <td>Traits</td>
            <td>AL</td>
            <td>Credit Cost</td>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Heavy stubber</td>
            <td>20"</td>
            <td>40"</td>
            <td>-</td>
            <td>-1</td>
            <td>4</td>
            <td>-1</td>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>4+</td>
            <td>Rapid Fire (2), Unwieldy</td>
            <td>R7</td>
            <td>130</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

Weapon Profiles appear slightly differently on Necrodamus, for the sake of brevity.

| Weapon        | Rg S | Rg L | Ac S | Ac L |  S  | AP  |  D  | Am  | Traits                   | AL  | Cost |
| :------------ | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :----------------------- | :-: | :--: |
| Heavy stubber | 20"  | 40"  |  -   |  -1  |  4  | -1  |  1  | 4+  | Rapid Fire (2), Unwieldy | R7  | 130  |

A weapon’s characteristics are defined as follows:

### Range (Rng)

Each weapon has two ranges: Short (S) and Long (L), usually presented as a number of inches. Weapons
cannot hit models outside of their Long range. There
may be other effects associated with an attack being
within either the Long or Short range of a weapon, these will be described when they come up.

Some weapon ranges are shown as a letter rather than
a number of inches. If a weapon’s range is listed as an
‘E’, it can only be used in close combat against targets
that are Engaged with the wielder. If a weapon’s range
is ‘T’, it uses the [Flame template](/docs/the-rules/shooting#flame-templates). Weapons with range E or T normally only have a Long
range given, not a Short range, indicating that this is
the furthest range at which the weapon can be used.

### Accuracy (Acc)

This shows the modifiers that are applied to the hit roll
when attacking with the weapon within Short range
or Long range. The ‘S’ modifier applies if the weapon
is being used to attack a target within its Short range, and the ‘L’ modifier applies if the weapon is being used
to attack a target beyond Short range but within Long
range. Most such modifiers are positive, but some may
be negative.

### Strength (Str)

This is the weapon’s Strength, which is used when
making wound rolls against the target. For most
weapons, particularly ranged weapons, this is a simple
number. For close combat weapons – those with a
range of E – this may be shown as ‘S’, meaning the
Strength of the wielder should be used, or as S with a
modifier, meaning the Strength of the wielder is used
but with a modifier applied.

### Armour Piercing (AP)

This shows how good the weapon is at punching
through a target’s armour. This is a modifier which is
applied to the dice rolled to make an armour save. Most often, this will be a negative modifier, but in some
cases it may be a positive modifier or even a ‘-’ which
denotes no modifier.

### Damage (D)

This represents how much damage the weapon inflicts. This in turn indicates how many Wounds a fighter loses
or how many Injury dice are rolled against them as a
result of the attack. This is explained in more detail in [Inflicting Damage](/docs/the-rules/resolve-hits#3-inflict-damage). Against a vehicle it determines how many
Damage dice are rolled. This is explained in more detail in [Resolving Hits Aginst Vehicles: Making Wound Rolls](/docs/the-rules/resolve-hits-against-vehicles#2-make-wound-roll).

### Ammo (Am)

If this characteristic is presented as a target number, a Firepower dice must be rolled as well as the hit
dice when attacking with it, as there is a chance
of it running Out of Ammo, jamming or otherwise
malfunctioning. This is explained in more detail in [Resolving Hits: The Firepower Dice](/docs/the-rules/shooting#the-firepower-dice).

### Traits

Most weapons have one or more Traits, each of which
gives the weapon a unique bonus or changes the way
in which it works.

### Availability Level (Al)

This indicates how easily available a weapon is
from the Trading Post, either Rare (R), Illegal (I) or
Exclusive (E). This is explained in more detail in [The Post-Battle Sequence: Visiting the Trading Post](/docs/the-rules/the-post-battle-sequence#b-visit-the-trading-post).

### Credit Cost

This indicates how much it costs to purchase the
weapon from the Trading Post. This is explained in
more detail in [The Post-Battle Sequence: Visiting the Trading Post](/docs/the-rules/the-post-battle-sequence#b-visit-the-trading-post).
