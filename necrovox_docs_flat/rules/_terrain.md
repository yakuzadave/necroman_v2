Terrain plays a vitally important role. During setup, any terrain may have the following designations.

### Dangerous Terrain
Vats of molten metal, spinning turbines set into the floor and more  -  any  terrain  feature  designated  as  dangerous  when setting  up  the  battlefield  can  pose  a  huge  risk  to  fighters crossing it.

A  model  can  cross  dangerous  terrain  in  the  same  way  as difficult  terrain.  However,  a  test  must  be  passed  to  avoid injury:
- Fighter: Pass an Initiative test or go Out of Action.
- Vehicle:  Pass  a  Handling  test  or  suffer  a Catastrophic hit to the Drive.

### Difficult Terrain
Pools of toxic sludge, areas of fallen rubble and broken or missing walkways sections - there are numerous things in the underhive that can make the terrain difficult to cross.

Every 1” counts as 2" when moving through difficult terrain.

### Ductways
Ductways can be up to 2” in length and can be placed across any  2”  wide  wall  or  any  other  terrain  features  that  would otherwise  be  impassable. Their  presence  allows  fighters  to crawl  or  shoot  through  a  narrow  duct  using  the  following actions.

:::info Action
**Crawl Through Ductway (Double):** If within 1” of a  ductway,  place  the  fighter  within  1”  of  the  other  end, provided they can be set up so that they are not within 1” of an enemy fighter and so that their base does not overlap that of another friendly fighter or an obstacle.
:::

:::info Action
**Fire Through Ductway (Basic):** If  within  1”  of  a ductway, make a ranged attack against an enemy fighter that is within 1” of the other end of the same ductway. The attack  will  hit  on  a  5+,  regardless  of  BS  or  modifiers. Weapons   that   normally   use   a   Template   instead automatically hit all fighters within 2” of the other end of the ductway.
:::

### Ductway: Firing Port
Related to the Gang Stronghold terrain, intended to have one gang as defender.
- Provides full cover.
- Can  be  moved  through  like  a  Ductway  (Double action).

### Impassable Terrain
Impassable terrain can't be moved across.

### Obstacles
Obstacles are any free standing terrain feature measuring no more than 2” high and no more than 2” across, although they may be far longer, such as barricades, barrels and pipelines.

:::info
### Attacking Over Barricades (N17)
A fighter who is in base contact with a barricade counts as being Engaged with a fighter that is in base contact with the other side of the barricade, even though their bases are not touching, as long as the two fighters are within ½" of each other. Any  close  combat  attack  made  across  a  barricade (regardless of range, Versatile etc.) has a -1 to hit modifier.
:::

### Railings
If  the  nearest  edge  of  a  level  or  platform  is  bounded  by  a railing or similar barrier at least ½“ tall, the chance of falling is reduced. When a fighter goes from Standing to Prone, add +1 modifier to the Initiative test to see if the fighter falls.

### Solid Terrain Features
Solid terrain features completely block line of sight and can't be measured across. 

### Stairs
If going Prone on stairs, pass an Initiative test or fall down to the bottom of the stairs (or mid-staircase landing). If falling 3” or more down the staircase, suffer a S3 D1 hit. A falling fighter is immediately Pinned and the activation ends.

### Structures
Structures  are  any  terrain  feature  measuring  more  than  2” high  and  more  than  2”  across,  be  they  free  standing  or connected to other terrain features in some way. Structures may feature many different levels, platforms and walkways on which fighters may be placed.

Other  than  the  difference  in  size,  there  is  little  difference between obstacles and structures.

Fighters may climb over obstacles or up onto structures as described  in  the  movement  rules,  but  be  aware  that movement  may  be  reduced  or  not  possible  over  obstacles and structures.

### Walls
Walls are impassable terrain and solid terrain.
