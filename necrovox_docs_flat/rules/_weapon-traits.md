:::info
You are viewing the archived rules from before the 2023 Core books. Use the menu to navigate to the current rules.
:::

### Backstab

+1 Strength when outside the target’s vision arc.

### Blast (3”/5”)

The weapon utilises a Blast marker.

### Blaze

A target not taken Out of Action catch fire on 4+. When activated while subject to this condition, act as follows (cannot make any actions):

1. Suffer a S3, AP -1 hit.
2. Move:
   - If Engaged or Seriously Injured, no move is made.→ Go to step 3.
   - If Pinned, become Active.
   - If Active, move 2D6” in a random direction.
     - Movement stops if contacting impassable terrain.
     - If within ½” of an edge, pass an Initiative test to avoid falling.
     - If moving beyond an edge, fall down.
   - At the end of this move, the fighter can choose to become Pinned.
3. Roll a 6+ to put out flames (with modifiers):
   - +2 if Pinned.
   - +1 per friendly Active fighters within 1”.4) Then the activation ends.

:::tip YAQ
Inorganic targets are not affected.
:::

Vehicles:

- Suffer a S3, AP-1 hit against Rear Toughness.
- Make a Cool test:
  - Pass: Activate normally.
  - Fail: Act according to Lose Control. If Stationary, make a Burn Out (Double) action. Then the activation ends.
- After the activation, flames go out on a 4+.

### Burrowing

Can be used against targets outside LOS:

- Place the Blast (3") anywhere on any level (ignoring LOS).
- Scatter 2D6” (instead of hit roll).
- If scatter result is a 'Hit', the Blast doesn't scatter.
- Otherwise, ignore impassable terrain (when scattering 2D6").
- No effect if scattering off the battlefield (wasted).

At the start of the End phase of the round this weapon was fired, any fighters touched by the blast is hit by the weapon.

### Chem Delivery

Declare what type of equipped chem is used. If the weapon also has Toxin or Gas, these Traits can be used instead.

Instead of making a wound roll, roll equal to or higher than the Toughness (inverse Toughness test) to inflict the dose. A result of 6 (before modifiers) always succeeds.

### Combi

A combi-weapon has 2 profiles. When fired, pick a profile for the attack.

- Roll twice for Ammo tests and apply the worst result.
- If one profile runs Out of Ammo, the other can still fire (unless also Out of Ammo).

In addition, some weapons are worsened when part of combi:

- Plasma: Only low power mode.
- Grenade launcher ammo that get Single Shot:
  - Anti-plant
  - Frag
  - Flare
- Flamer and hand flamer: Unstable.
- Needler/Needle rifle: Decrease Short Range Accuracy and AP by 1.

:::tip YAQ
Additional ammo can be loaded in to combi-weapons:

- Dumdum rounds gain Combi.
- Grenades gain Combi and Single shot.

Hotshot las pack can't be fitted to combi weapons.
:::

### Concussion

-2 Initiative/Handling (minimum 6+) until the end of the round.

### Cursed

When hit, pass a Willpower test or become Insane.

### Defoliate

Deals D3 Damage to Carnivorous Plants. Brainleaf Zombies lose a wound and are removed from the battlefield if they suffer an Out of Action result on the Injury dice.

### Demolition

Can use the Grenade in close combat attacks against scenery targets (doors/objectives). Apply a single automatic hit (regardless of Attack dice).

### Digi

Mounted on a ring or hidden inside a glove. Can be used in addition to any other Melee weapons, granting an additional close combat attack. Does not count towards the maximum number of weapons a fighter can carry. A fighter can carry up to 10 Digi weapons.

### Disarm

If the hit is 6 (before modifiers), the target can't use any weapons when making Reaction attacks for the rest of the round - they make unarmed attacks instead.

### Drag

If hit (and not taking the target Out of Action), the target can be dragged closer to the attacker. Roll a D6, if the result is equal to or higher than the target’s Strength, the target is dragged D3” straight towards the attacker, stopping if they hit any terrain. If they move into another fighter (other than the attacker), both fighters are moved the remaining distance towards the attacker.

If the weapon also has the Impale trait, only the last fighter to be hit can be dragged.

### Entangle

Hits can't be negated by the Parry trait. In addition, if the hit is a 6 (before modifiers), any reaction attacks from the target suffer a -2 modifier.

### Fear

Instead of suffering an Injury roll, the target must pass a Nerve test with a -2 modifier or immediately become Broken (run for cover).

### Fixed

Represented by a weapon on its own base (not equipped by a fighter). A fighter beginning the activation B2B can spend a Double action (Move Weapon) to make a single Move, then place the weapon in B2B (after moving).

If B2B with a fixed weapon (and no enemies in B2B with the fixed weapon), a fighter can aim, shoot and reload it as normal.

### Flare

A fighter hit becomes Revealed (if in darkness). If using Blast, leave it in place. While on the board, all models at least touched by it are illuminated and are Revealed. In the End phase, the flare goes out and is removed on a 4+.

### Flash

Instead of making a wound roll for models hit, pass an Initiative/Handling test or become subject to the Blind condition. If Ready, the model is no longer Ready. Or if not Ready, the model is not readied at the start of the following round. Reaction attacks only hit on a 6 (before modifiers). No other attacks can be made until the next activation.

### Gas

Instead of making a wound roll, roll equal to or higher than the Toughness (a 6 before modifiers always succeeds) to inflict an Injury roll (regardless of Wounds). No save roll can be made.

- Fighters: Not Pinned when hit.
- Vehicles: Use the Rear Toughness. If successful, inflict a Driver Wounded result.

Notes:

- The target's Wounds are not affected.
- YAQ: Inorganic targets are not affected.

### Graviton Pulse

Instead of making a wound roll:

- Fighter: Pass a Strength test or suffer Damage. No save roll can be made.
- Vehicle: Roll equal to or higher than the Toughness (against the facing hit) to inflict a hit to the Body. Save roll can be made.

Leave any Blast marker in place for the rest of the round. It counts as difficult terrain and can't be ignored (for example by vehicle special rules).

### Grenade

Grenades are Wargear (not a weapon), but treated as a special type of ranged weapon that can be thrown as a Shoot (Basic) action. Grenades do not have Short range. Long range is determined by multiplying the fighter’s Strength.

Do not roll Firepower dice for Grenades, instead always make an Ammo test. Grenades can't be reloaded - once they are gone, they are gone for the entire battle.

### Gunk

Gain the Gunk condition:

- -1” M (minimum 1”).
- Don’t add D3” when making a charging.
- -1 modifier to Initiative tests.
- Catch fire on 2+ (rather than 4+) when hit by Blaze weapons.

The Gunked condition lasts until the End phase or the fighter catches fire after being hit by a Blaze weapon.

### Haemophagic

When resolving a Toxin attack with this weapon, apply a +1 modifier if this weapon has previously hit
the target

### Hexagrammatic

Hits ignore Psychic power saves. 2x damage against Psykers.

### Impale

If a target is wounded, the projectile continues through and might hit another fighter! Trace a straight line from the target, directly away from the attacker. If there are any fighters within 1” of this line, and within the weapon’s Long Range, the one that is closest to the target is hit on a 3+ with -1 Strength per subsequent hit. The projectile can continue through multiple fighters until the Strength is reduced to 0.

### Ironhead (Weapon Variant)

Improved version: Rapid Fire (+1).

Heavy Flamer also reduce Ammo to 6+.

Note: Probably can't take any additional ammo.

### Knockback

If the hit roll is equal or higher than the target fighter’s Strength, the target is moved 1” directly away.

If the target can't be moved the full 1” (because of walls, obstacles or other models), move as far as possible and increase the Damage by 1.

If any part of the base is knocked back over an edge, pass an Initiative test or fall.

If a Blast weapon has the Knockback trait, roll a D6 for each fighter that is hit. If the centre of the Blast was over the centre of the base, roll a Scatter to determine the direction to move.

In Melee, the attacking fighter can choose to follow up, moving directly towards them to remain in B2B. If the attack was made across a barricade, the attacker can't do this.

### Lance

+1S while Mounted when Charging or Ride By.

### Lance-bomb

The first successful hit scored by this weapon each battle is resolved using the Primed profile, all subsequent hits are resolved using the Spent profile.

### Limited

When limited ammo run out, that type is permanently lost and can't be used again until more is purchased. The weapon can still be reloaded using any remaining profile(s).

:::tip YAQ
Only a single ‘dose’ of ammo can be carried per weapon. Reduce fighter’s cost accordingly after the ammo is lost.
:::

### Master-crafted (Weapon Variant)

Once per battle, re-roll a single failed hit roll.

### Melee

Applies to all weapons with range E (Engaged). Can be used during close combat attacks.

### Melta

Applies to short range hits (or any hit if there is no short range):

- Fighters: If reduced to 0 Wounds, any Injury dice are automatically Out of Action (no need to roll).
- Vehicles: +1 Damage dice.

### Paired

Applies to all weapons explicitly purchased as “paired”.

Counts as being equipped with dual Melee weapons when calculating the number of Attack dice. Double the base Attacks characteristic when charging.

### Parry

In close combat, the defender can force the attacker to re-roll one successful hit. If armed with two Parry weapons, two successful hits can be re-rolled instead.

### Phase

Ignore saves from armour and field armour (saves from special rules can still be used).

### Plentiful

Ammo tests are automatically passed (no roll is required) when reloading.

### Power

- Can't be parried except by other Power weapons.
- A hit roll of 6 gives:
  - Ignores Save rolls (except Field armour).
  - +1 Damage (does not apply in combination with certain other traits like Toxin).
- Pitch Black: Revealed (when used).

- Fighter: Change an Injury dice from Flesh Wound to Serious Injury.
- Vehicle: +1 Damage dice.

### Rad-phage

After fully resolving all hits, roll 4+ per fighter hit to inflict a single Flesh Wound.

### Rapid Fire (X)

A successful hit scores a number of hits equal to the number of bullet holes on the Firepower dice. The amount of dice that can be rolled is up to the number shown in brackets (for example, Rapid Fire (2) allows for up to 2 Firepower dice to be rolled). Make an Ammo test for each Ammo symbol that is rolled. If any of them fail, the gun runs Out of Ammo. If two or more fail, the gun has jammed and can't be used for the rest of the battle.

The first shot must be allocated to the original target. Additional shots can be allocated to other targets that are within range, in line of sight and within 3” of the original target. Additional targets can't be harder to hit than the original target. Allocate all hits before making any wound rolls.

Blasts (roll hit & Rapid Fire as normal):

- Hit: Place any extra Blasts within 3" of the original target.
- Miss: All Blasts scatter separately from the original target.

Template (roll Rapid Fire as normal):

- The additional hits applies to the first target (closest to the attacker).

### Reckless

Ignores Target priority. Randomize the target from all eligible targets (friend & foe).

- Ranged: Targets in the attacker’s LOS and range of the weapon.
  - Rapid Fire: Additional hits must be distributed among the maximum number of eligible targets. If there are more hits than eligible targets, choose where any spare hits are allocated.

### Scattershot

If hit, inflict D6 wound rolls instead of 1.

### Seismic

A wound roll of 6 (before modifiers) ignores save rolls.

- Fighter: Always Pinned - even if an ability would normally allow to avoid being Pinned by ranged attack hits.
- Vehicle: Pass a Hnd test or Lose Control.

:::note
It seems the Pinning effect of Seismic is mainly used to deny the Nerves of Steel skill. The Chaos Spawn is unaffected.
:::

### Sever

Injury rolls inflicted with this weapon are automatically Out of Action.

### Shock

If the hit roll is a 6 (before modifiers), the attack automatically wounds.

### Shield

Grants improved save against attacks from the 90° front.

- Melee attacks: +2 Save modifier.
- Ranged attacks: +1 Save modifier.

- Max 1 attack per sidearm.

### Silent

- Sneak Attack (scenario special rule): No test to see whether the alarm is raised when this weapon is fired.
- Pitch Black (scenario special rule): A Hidden fighter is not Revealed when using this weapon.

### Single Shot

Can only be used once per battle. Counts as having automatically failed an Ammo test. There is no need to roll the Firepower dice unless the weapon also has the Rapid Fire (x) trait.

### Smoke

Does not cause hits, Pinning or Wounds. Instead, mark the hit location with a counter. The smoke extends 2.5” vertically and horizontally from the centre. Fighters can move through smoke, but it blocks line of sight, so attacks can't be made into, out of or through it. In the End phase, roll a 5+ or remove the cloud.

### Template

Applies to all weapons with range T (Template).Use the Flame template to determine how many targets are hit.

### Toxin

Instead of making a wound roll, roll equal to or higher than the Toughness (a 6 before modifiers always succeeds) to inflict an Injury roll (regardless of Wounds).

- Fighter: Out of Action
- Vehicle: The weapon can't be used again this battle and suffer a Catastrophic hit to the body (lose 1 wound, or 2 if no weapons remain, pass a Hnd test or Lose Control).

The attack is still resolved against the target.

:::note
When used with an effect which forces an Ammo roll without Firepower dice (for example Grenade), the 4+ Unstable test must always be made.
:::

### Twin-linked (Weapon Variant)

Re-roll any number of ammo dice.

### Unwieldy

- Ranged: A Shoot action counts as a Double action (instead of Basic).
- Melee: Requires 2 hands so a second weapon can't be used at the same time (dual wielding).

:::danger House Rule (Necrodamus, A&A)
Apply -1 hit modifier if shooting Unwieldy weapons as anything other than Double action.
:::

### Versatile

Applies to all Melee weapons with a long range.A fighter with a Versatile weapon does not need to be B2B with an enemy fighter to Engage and attack in melee (can stop within the versatile range to fight). The extended melee range only applies for:

- The attackers activation.
- When making Reaction attacks.

Note that the target must be within vision arc and Long range.

The target is considered to be Engaged, but may not in turn be Engaging the attacker (with Versatile) unless also having a Versatile weapon, and so may not be able to make Reaction attacks.

At all times other than during this fighter’s activation or when making Reaction attacks, Versatile has no effect.

:::note
Only fighters B2B can grant assists!
:::

### Vortex

A fighter who is hit by a weapon with the Vortex trait must make an Initiative test. If successful, move them the shortest distance to avoid the Blast marker. Otherwise, they immediately go Out of Action. Any obstacles touched by a Vortex Blast marker are also removed from the battlefield. If a vehicle is hit by a weapon with the Vortex trait, they are immediately Wrecked and removed from the battlefield.

After working out the effects of an attack with a weapon with the Vortex trait, leave the blast marker on the battlefield. At the start of each End phase, roll on the Vortex Stability table for each Vortex Blast marker:

#### Vortex Stability Table

| &nbsp;&nbsp;D6&nbsp;&nbsp; | Result                                                                                                                                      |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1-2                        | The vortex vanishes with no further effect. Remove the Blast marker.                                                                        |
| 3-4                        | The vortex remains unchanged. Any models coming into contact with the Vortex Blast marker in the subsequent round count as being hit by it. |
| 5-6                        | Move the Vortex Blast marker D6+2" in a random direction (as determined by the Scatter dice).                                               |

Any models or terrain in its path or under the Blast marker when it stops count as being hit by it.

### Web

A successful wound roll inflicts an automatic Seriously Injured result (Webbed). No save roll can be made. Roll for Recovery during the End phase and apply the result as normal, with the following exceptions:

- Flesh Wound: No longer webbed.
- Seriously Injured: Still webbed.
- Out of Action: 'Out Cold' (no Lasting Injury roll).

**Note:** Flesh Wound are applied as normal.

A Webbed fighter does not succumb to their injuries and will automatically recover. When rolling to determine if any enemy fighters are captured at the end of the battle, add +1 to the dice roll for each enemy fighter currently Webbed and add them among any eligible to be Captured.

Vehicles: Not affected.
