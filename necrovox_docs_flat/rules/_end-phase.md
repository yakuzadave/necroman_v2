# End Phase

:::info
You are viewing the archived rules from before the 2023 Core books. Use the menu to navigate to the current rules.
:::

After all models that wish to activate have activated, the Action phase ends

:::note 
### Remove Temporary Effects

**Smoke:** Roll a D6 per smoke cloud: on a 1-4 it is removed.  
**Graviton Pulse:** Remove any Graviton Pulse blasts.  
**Toxic Sludge:** Roll a 2+ for each Prone fighter that is at least partially in a pool of toxic sludge, or go Out of Action.

:::


## End Phase Order

1. Bottle tests.
2. Fleeing the Battlefield (if Bottled out).
3. Recover & Restart.
4. Rally tests (Broken models)

## Bottle Tests

Make a Bottle test for gangs with at least one model Seriously Injured or Out of Action (including wrecked vehicles). The player with Priority starts.

**D6 + Seriously Injured + Out of Action > starting crew**

Roll a D6 and add the number of models in the gang who are either Seriously Injured or Out of Action. If the result is higher than the total number of models in the starting crew (the number of models present at the start of the battle), the gang has bottled out (no need to test again as the gang remains bottled out for the rest of the battle).

Alternatively, a gang can choose to automatically fail.

:::info N17 (Improved Version)
Include all models when making bottle tests (models present at the start of the battle and any that have joined since).
:::

:::danger House Rule (A&A)

- Reinforcements count towards bottle tests.
- A voluntary fail automatically loses the match.
  
:::

## Fleeing the Battlefield

Once a gang has Bottled Out, models may begin to flee the battlefield.

Starting with the gang with Priority, every model must pass a Cool test, regardless of Status, Secondary Status or any Conditions. Models that fail will flee the battlefield:

- Fighter:
  - Standing or Pinned: Removed with no ill effect.
  - Seriously Injured: Removed and must test succumb to their injuries after the battle.
- Vehicle: Wrecked (without risking any damage). The crew abandons the vehicle and returns after the battle to collect it.

For the purposes of the scenario being played, models that flee in this way are considered to have gone Out of Action (unless the scenario states otherwise).

#### Leading by Example

Fighters draw courage from their leaders.

After the gang bottles out, if a model with the Leading By Example ability passes the Fleeing the Battlefield (Cool) test in the End phase, any friendly model within X” automatically pass the Cool test and will not flee.

- _Leader:_ 12” (any other model).
- _Champion:_ 6” (models without LBE).

Notes:

- Only fighters from the same “group” are affected, for example Alliance or Gang.
- Keep in mind the role of walls and solid terrain features when measuring the distance between fighters.

:::info N17-N21 (Improved Version)
Champions can only use Leading By Example for models without this ability
:::

#### Voluntarily Fleeing

Once bottled out (either voluntarily or failing a Bottle test), any model (not Seriously Injured) can flee the battlefield at the start of any Action phase:

- **Active, Pinned or Vehicle:** Flee automatically.
- **Engaged:** Pass an Initiative test to flee, or be Seriously Injured instead.
- **Seriously Injured:** Cannot voluntarily flee.

Once the gang only has Seriously Injured fighters remaining, the battle ends. Roll for Seriously Injured fighters succumbing to their injuries as normal.

## Recovery & Restart

Models with the following statuses can attempt to recover once per End phase for a single condition:

- Fighter: Seriously Injured.
- Vehicle:
  - Stationary.
  - Driver Black Out.
  - Flesh Wound.

#### Fighter (Seriously Injured)

Each Seriously Injured fighter must make a Recovery test by rolling an Injury dice:

- **Flesh Wound:** Suffers a Flesh Wound and become Pinned.
- **Seriously Injured:** The fighter remains as they are (Prone and Seriously Injured).
- **Out of Action:** The fighter is Out of Action (suffering a Lasting Injury roll as normal).

#### Assistance

When making a Recovery test, one Active friendly fighter within 1” of the recovering fighter can assist:

- +1 Injury dice (choose one to resolve and discard the others).

A fighter can only assist one recovering fighter in each End phase.

#### Vehicle: Stationary

Pass a Handling test (+1 modifier if having 2+ Wounds remaining) to become Mobile.

#### Vehicle: Driver Black Out

Roll a 4+ to recover and suffer a Flesh Wound.

#### Vehicle: Flesh Wound

Roll a D6:

| D6      | Result                                    |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **1**   | Suffer a Driver Black Out (Crew Damage)\* |
| **2-3** | No effect (the Flesh Wound remains).      |
| **4+**  | Remove 1 Flesh Wound                      |

\*Suffering a Driver Black Out incurs the following:

- Automatically Lose Control.
- Become Stationary.
- Lose any Ready condition.
- Cannot become Ready (at the start of a round) until the driver regains consciousness.

## Rally Tests

After making Recovery tests in the End phase, Broken models can attempt to Rally (no longer Broken):

- Pass a Cool test (+1 modifier per friendly model within 3" that are not Broken or Seriously Injured).

If failed, remain Broken until the Rally Test in the next End phase

:::note Flooded Passage (Special Terrain Feature)
At the end of each End phase, roll 2+ for each Seriously Injured fighter in the Flood Water or they are taken Out of Action (their injuries are too great to keep their head above water).
:::

:::note Badzone Environments
If using Badzone Environments, roll to see if the current is discarded. If discarded, generate a new Event.
:::

:::note
Leading by Example is not affected by any status or condition (Broken, Seriously Injured, Blaze etc.)
