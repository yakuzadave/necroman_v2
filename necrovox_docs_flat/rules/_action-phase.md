## Activate Fighters

:::note
A  Standing  fighter  may  turn  to  face  any  direction  when activated, before making actions.
:::

Starting with the gang with Priority, take turns to pick one of the Ready fighters to activate and make up to 2 actions with them. 

Note  that  the  actions  a  Ready  fighter  can  perform  are governed  by  their  current  Status  and  Secondary  Status. Some  Conditions  will  also  limit  the  actions  a  fighter  may make, for example Broken.

If one gang runs out of fighters to activate, the other gang can activate all of their remaining fighters in any order. Once all fighters have been activated, even if they performed no actions during their activation, the Action phase ends.

## Insanity
If subject to the Insane condition, roll a D6:

| &nbsp;&nbsp;**D6**&nbsp;&nbsp; | **Result** |
|:---:|:---|
| **1-2** | The fighter is immediately Broken, if already Broken, they flee (even if their gang has not failed a Bottle test). |
| **3-4** | An opposing gang (roll-off if multi-player) can control that fighter  this  turn,  treating  them  as  part  of  their  gang.  As soon as the activation ends, the Insane fighter no longer counts as being part of the opposing gang. |
| **5-6** | The fighter act as normal. Once the activation is over, pass a Willpower test to lose the Insanity. |


## Group Activations
When activating a fighter with the Group Activation (X) ability, additional  Ready  friendly  Faction  fighters  within  3”  can  be activated  at  the  same  time.  Most  Leaders  and  Champions have this:
- **Leader:** 2 additional Ready fighters.
- **Champion:** 1 additional Ready fighter.

If a Leader or Champion is activated in this way, they may not then perform a Group Activation themselves!

All fighters must be nominated before any of them makes an action. Then activate each fighter in the group as normal, fully resolving their activation before picking the next fighter. Each fighter   activates   individually,   groups   never   activate simultaneously.

### Group Activation (Pets)
All  owners  automatically  gain  this  ability,  even  if  they  don’t have Group Activation initially. All pets automatically join their owner in a Group Activation (does not count towards the limit for other fighters), even if the owner itself was activated as part of a Group Activation.

### Exceptions
- Champion  (Specialist)  does  not  have  Group Activation.
- Slave Ogryn Leader only has Group Activation (1).
- Slave  Ogryn  Champion  does  not  have  Group Activation.
- Greim Leader does not have Group Activation.

:::note
Group  Activations  are  not  affected  by  any  status  or condition (Broken, Seriously Injured, Blaze etc.).
