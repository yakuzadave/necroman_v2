# Vehicle Movement

## Vehicles And Difficult Terrain

How a vehicle interacts with difficult terrain depends
upon how the vehicle moves. This will be indicated in
the vehicle’s rules, normally based on their type of Locomotion.

### Locomotion Special Rules

All vehicles must have a Locomotion special rule – this dictates how they interact with terrain. The four
Locomotive special rules are Skimmer, Tracked, Walker and Wheeled.

#### Wheeled

For every 1" a walker moves through difficult terrain, it counts as having moved 2".

#### Tracked

Ignore movement penalties when moving over difficult terrain.

#### Skimmers

Ignore all difficult & dangerous terrain. If ending an activation on difficult or dangerous terrain, pass a Handling test or suffer a Catastrophic hit to the Drive.

#### Walker

Make any amount of turns during an activation.

For every 1" a walker moves through difficult terrain, it counts as having moved 2".

## Vehicles And Dangerous Terrain

A vehicle may cross dangerous terrain in the same way
as difficult terrain. However to safely do so, a vehicle
must also pass a Handling check. If this check is
passed, the vehicle crosses the terrain safely. If it fails, a vehicle will suffer an immediate [Catastrophic Hit to its Drive](/docs/the-rules/resolve-hits-against-vehicles#drive-damage-table).

## Fighter Movement On Vehicles

In the ash wastes, gang members scramble over
vehicles as they race along, engaging in rooftop fights
and leaping from one vehicle to another.

To represent this, fighters treat vehicles like terrain for
the purposes of movement, climbing up the sides and
leaping onto them from gantries (though falling and
ending up Prone next to a vehicle is a very dangerous
position to be in).

However, trying to balance on the roof of a speeding
vehicle is a tricky proposition. Whenever a vehicle
moves, any fighters on it, except those on designated
transport spaces, must immediately pass an Initiative
check or fall. If they fall, place them 1" away from the
vehicle in a direction determined by the Scatter dice
after the vehicle has finished moving. If this causes
them to land within ½" of the edge of a platform, they
must test again to avoid falling. If it would cause them
to hit impassable terrain, move them the shortest
distance so as to be able to be placed. They only need
to test once during each vehicle’s activation, though
will also have to test if the vehicle they are on is moved
as part of a collision.

Note that objects such as Loot caskets will
automatically fall off a vehicle if not placed in a
designated transport area, unless it is in base contact
with a fighter which passes its Initiative check.

## Obstacles

Obstacles are any free standing terrain feature
measuring no more than 2" high and no more than 2"
across, such as barricades, barrels and pipelines.

Vehicles may cross obstacles as they move, and in
doing so will destroy the obstacle and cause it to be
removed from the battlefield. However, when moving
across an obstacle in this way, a vehicle may take
damage – see [Colliding with Terrain](/docs/rules/vehicles/vehicle-impacts#colliding-with-terrain).

## Structures (Sturdy & Flimsy)

Structures are any terrain feature measuring more
than 2" high or more than 2" across, be they free
standing or connected to other terrain features in some
way. Vehicles may not climb up onto structures as
they move.

Structures can be either sturdy or flimsy. Vehicles may
suffer damage when colliding with a structure, and if
flimsy the structure will be destroyed, a sturdy structure
cannot be destroyed (see [Colliding with Terrain](/docs/rules/vehicles/vehicle-impacts#colliding-with-terrain)).

## Vehicles And Falling

Sometimes, whether due to a particularly foolhardy
driver deliberately driving off or a vehicle losing control/
being rammed, a vehicle will fall off an elevated height.
When this happens the vehicle must pass a [Loss of Control test](/docs/rules/vehicles/vehicle-resolve-hits#loss-of-control-tests) with a cumulative -1
modifier for every 3" fallen, rounding up to the nearest
inch. In addition they take a hit (see [Determining Damage](/docs/rules/vehicles/vehicle-resolve-hits#2-make-wound-roll)) resolving Damage against the Rear
Toughness and Drive location.
