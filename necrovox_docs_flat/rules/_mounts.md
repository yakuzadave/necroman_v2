_In the vast wastes there is a dizzying array of personal transport options used by gangers. The mounts represented here can be used to represent anything you wish from humble dirtbike to choppers, exotic cyber-animals or anything else!_

## Mounted Condition

Mounts can't be purchased for or be combined with the following:

- Vehicle crew.
- Ash Waste Nomads (except when the mount is included for the fighter).
- Wargear that affects movement (for example jump booster or grav-cutter).

The following applies to all mounted fighters:

#### Hands Full

- -1 Weapon slots.
- Cannot equip non-Lance Unwieldy weapons.
- Cannot use more than 1 weapon in close combat.

#### Ride By

Attack while moving:

- Can move within 1" of a single enemy (during movement).
- Can interrupt movement to make a single close combat attack against an enemy if moving within 1" (or Versatile range).
- Target may attempt to make a single Reaction attack. If hit, use the distance they have moved during this activation instead of their last activation to determine the strength of the hit they take (see [I Get Knocked Down…](#i-get-knocked-down)).

#### Quick Retreat

- +2 Initiative to Retreat (Basic).

#### Grounded

- Cannot climb terrain or vehicles.

#### My Mount Is My Life

The fighter can join battles with or without the Mount, but cannot dismount mid-battle.

#### "I Get Knocked Down…"

If Pinned when hit by a ranged attack, make an Initiative test (-1 modifier if hit by Blast or Knockback):

- Pass: Avoid being Pinned.
- Fail: Become Knocked Down (Pinned).

When Knocked Down, suffer an automatic hit. The severity is determined by how far the fighter moved during their last activation, rounded up to the nearest inch \[Think of this as their speed - servo_scribe\]. If this happens during the Mounted fighter's own movement, use the currently moved distance instead.

| Distance Moved | Strength | AP  | Damage |
| -------------- | -------- | --- | ------ |
| 0"-5"          | 3        | -   | 1      |
| 6"-9"          | 5        | -1  | 1      |
| 10"+           | 7        | -2  | 2      |

#### Pinned & Stand Up

When Pinned, a Stand Up (Basic) action requires passing an Initiative test. If failed, the action is wasted (remain Pinned).

:::note Vehicle Upgrades & Wargear

If all gangs agree, mounts can be customized by vehicle Upgrades & Wargear (up to one Upgrade per area). However Weapon Hardpoints cannot be added to a Mount (use the Custom Vehicle rules instead).
