# Characteristics Profiles

:::

Each model (fighters & vehicles) and weapon has a characteristics profile, which details their capabilities in battle. For vehicles,  the  stats  represent  the  vehicle  &  crew  combined. A  vehicle  is  a  single  entity  (regardless  of  how  many  crew members the vehicle has).

## Shared

### Move
Distance in inches the model can move (up to) when making various move actions.

### Ballistic Skill (BS)
Proficiency with ranged weapons.

### Toughness (T)
The ability to not be wounded by an attack.
Vehicles:
- Facings: Hits  must  determine  which  facing  they originate from to determine the Toughness.

### Wounds (W)
A measure of how much punishment a model can take.
Vehicles: Represents Hull Points.

### Initiative (I)
The model’s dexterity and reflexes.

### Leadership (Ld)
The fighter’s ability to issue or follow commands in the heat of battle.

### Cool (Cl)
A fighter’s capacity for keeping calm under fire.

### Willpower (Wil)
The fighter’s mental fortitude and resilience.

### Intelligence (Int)
Intelligence represents a fighter’s mental acuity and ability to apply knowledge.

## Fighter-specific

### Weapon Skill (WS)
Proficiency with melee weapons (and pistols when used in close combat).

### Strength (S)
The ability to inflict damage in close combat.

### Attacks (A)
The number of dice rolled when attacking in close combat.

## Vehicle & Crew Specific

### Save (Sv)
The save is included in the stats for vehicles.

### Handling (Hnd)
Equivalent to Initiative, but uses 2D6 instead (like other mental stats).

## Modifying Characteristics
Sometimes,  the  rules  will  modify  a  stat.  If  a  model  with Toughness 3 is given a +1 modifier, the Toughness counts as 4.  If  the  stat  is  given  as  a  target  number,  the  modifier  is effectively  applied  to  the  dice  roll.  For  example,  if  a  fighter with BS 4+ is given a +1 modifier, the BS would effectively be improved to 3+.

## Characteristic Tests

- **Weapon Skill, Ballistic Skill and Initiative**<br />
Roll  a  D6.  If  the  result  is  equal  to  or  higher  than  the characteristic, the test is passed. A result of 1 (before or after modifiers) is always failed.
- **Leadership,  Cool,  Willpower,  Intelligence  & Handling**<br />
Roll  2D6.  If  the  result  is  equal  to  or  higher  than  the characteristic, the test is passed. A result of 2 (before or after modifiers) is always failed.
- **Strength or Toughness**<br />
Roll  a  D6.  If  the  result  is  equal  to  or  lower  than  the characteristic, the test is passed.Vehicles: Since Toughness is separated in facings, Toughness tests must be relative to the facing.

## Minimum/Maximum Characteristics

Each stat has a maximum value. If a roll on the Advancement table for a Ganger has no option but to increase a Characteristic beyond its maximum, treat it as a roll of 12 instead.

|     | M   | WS  | BS  | S   | T   | W   | I   | A   | Ld  | Cl  | Wil | Int |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | --- |
| Max | 8”  | 2+  | 2+  | 6   | 6   | 6   | 2+  | 10  | 3+  | 3+  | 3+  | 3+  |
| Min | 1”  | 6+  | 6+  | 1   | 1   | 1   | 6+  | 1   | 10+ | 10+ | 10+ | 10+ |

- Max 2+ for Weapon Skill, Ballistic Skill and Initiative.
- Max 3+ for Leadership, Cool, Willpower and Intelligence.
- Max +2 Movement, Strength and Toughness (compared to the fighter’s current type).
- Max +1 Wound and Attack (compared to the fighter’s current type).

### Range (Rng)
Each weapon has two ranges: Short (S) and Long (L). If a weapon’s  range  is  listed  as  an  E,  it  is  a  close  combat weapon only usable against targets that are Engaged with the wielder. Otherwise, it is a ranged weapon. Template: All weapons with short range ‘T’ has the Template trait  and  uses  flame  template  when  fired. These  weapons never have a long range.Melee: All weapons with short range ‘E’ (Engaged) has the Melee trait and is used in close combat against targets that are B2B.Versatile: All weapons with short range ‘E’ and a long range (other  than  ‘-’)  has  the  Versatile  trait  and  can  be  used  in close combat even if the target is not B2B

### Accuracy
Modifiers that are applied to the hit roll when attacking with the weapon. The ‘S’ modifier applies at Short range and ‘L’ applies at Long range.

### Strength (Str)
The  weapon’s  Strength  used  when  making  wound  rolls.  If listed as a modifier, this is applied to the wielder’s Strength.

### Armour Penetration (AP)
The weapon’s ability to punch through armour. This modifier can increase or reduce the target’s save roll.

### Damage (D)
The weapon’s chance of damaging or taking a target Out of Action.

### Ammo (AM)
If this characteristic is a numerical value, a Firepower dice must be rolled when attacking with it, as there is a chance of it running Out of Ammo or jamming.

### Traits
Most weapons have one or more traits, each of which gives the weapon an unique bonus or changes the way it attacks.

## Damage ‘-’ Weapons
Weapons with Damage characteristic of ‘-’ do not cause Damage in the usual way and will not cause a fighter to lose a Wound.Consequently, if any Injury dice are rolled against a fighter as the result of an attack made by a Damage ‘-’ weapon, the result(s)  of  the  Injury  dice  are  applied  as  normal.  No Wounds are removed from the fighter.
