:::

## Types of Actions

There are 3 types of actions. Each action may be fully resolved before declaring the second action.

#### Basic Action

Can only be made once during a fighter’s activation.

#### Simple Action

Can be made more than once during their activation, each time still uses up one of their actions for the turn.

#### Double Action

Making a Double action counts as making two actions - meaning it takes up the fighter’s entire turn. If a fighter only has one action available for any reason, they can't make a Double action

## Standing: Active

### Move (Simple)

Make a Standard move.

- Move a distance up to their Movement characteristic.
- Climb vertically up or down.
- Cross any gap no wider than their base.
- Attempt to leap across a bigger gap provided they have enough movement left to do so.
- Attempt to jump down to a level below.

### Charge (Double)

Make a Move (Simple) action, adding D3” to the distance. During a charge, the fighter can move within 1” of a Standing (Active or Engaged) or Prone (Pinned or Seriously Injured) enemy (or more than one if they wish), but if they do, they must have sufficient movement to get into B2B with at least one enemy, becoming Engaged. If not, they must stop 1” away. If Engaged at the end of the action, the attacker must immediately make a free Fight (Basic) action. If ending up within 1” of a Seriously Injured enemy, they can make a free Coup de Grace (Simple) action instead.

When equipped with a versatile weapon, the charging fighter can end the move within the versatile weapon's range and must then make the free Fight action.

Vehicles: A fighter within 1" of a vehicle counts as being Engaged (it is sufficient to end the Charge within 1").

### Shoot (Basic)

Make an attack with a ranged weapon.

### Aim (Basic)

+1 hit modifier to any hit rolls in a subsequent Shoot / Fire All (Basic) action this activation.

### Reload (Simple)

Pick a weapon that is Out of Ammo and make an Ammo test. If passed, the weapon is reloaded and no longer Out of Ammo.

:::danger House Rule
Reload is Double action (instead of Simple).
:::

### Coup de Grace (Simple)

Requires the fighter to not be Engaged with any other fighters. Pick a Seriously Injured enemy fighter within 1” and within the vision arc of the fighter making the action. That fighter immediately goes Out of Action.

A fighter making a Charge (Double) action can make a Coup de Grace (Simple) action instead of a Fight (Basic) action if they end their move within 1” of a Prone and Seriously Injured fighter and not Engaged by any enemy fighters.

If making a fight action and the target becomes Seriously Injured, the fighter may end the action with a free Coup de Grace.

:::tip YAQ
Do not make a 2nd Nerve test for fighters that became Seriously Injured and then taken Out of Action by a free Coup de Grace action in the same activation.
:::

### Take Cover (Basic)

Move up to half Movement, then become Pinned.Note: Voluntarily becoming Pinned never triggers an Initiative test to prevent falling (edge, pitfall or similar).

### Ductways: Crawl Through Ductway (Double)

If within 1” of a ductway, place the fighter within 1” of the other end, provided they can be set up so that they are not within 1” of an enemy fighter and so that their base does not overlap that of another friendly fighter or an obstacle.

### Ductways: Fire Through Ductways (Basic)

If within 1” of a ductway, make a ranged attack against an enemy fighter that is within 1” of the other end of the same ductway. The attack will hit on a 5+, regardless of BS or modifiers. Weapons that normally use a Template instead automatically hit all fighters within 2” of the other end of the ductway.

:::tip YAQ
For Blasts, target a fighter within 1" of the ductway or any point within 1" of the ductway. Then roll to hit (5+) and scatter if it misses as normal.
:::

### Door: Operative (Simple)

If within 1”, either open a closed door or close an open door.

### Access Terminal (Basic)

Otherwise the attack fumbles and this fighter suffers a hit instead (both dice are less than the target's Toughness):

- S and D1 (use the attacker's Strength)

:::danger House Rule
Can be used instead of a Fight action, so it can be used in combination with a Charge.
:::

### Hurl (Basic)
