## Chem Suppliers

Chems are bought as single doses and can only be used once. After buying the first item of a specific chem, the gang has found a supplier for that chem, and it now counts as having a Legality/Rarity of Common.

After buying chems, roll a 2+ for each type, or the supply has run out (or, more likely, the supplier has been killed!), it is no longer automatically Common and must be bought using the original Legality/Rarity as normal.

#### Duration

- Lasts for the duration of a single battle (unless otherwise noted).
- Can be used before the battle begins, or during the battle by performing the Use Chem (Simple) action.

#### Mixing Chems

When taking a chem while already under the effect of a different chem, roll a D6. If the result is equal to or less than the number of chems the fighter has taken (including the one just taken), a bad reaction has occurred. Immediately go Out of Action and Into Recovery (no Lasting Injury roll). If multiple chems are taken before the battle, make this test at the start of the first activation.

## List of Chems

### Frenzon

Gain the Nerves of Steel, True Grit, Unstoppable and Berserk skills. All weapons gain the Reckless trait. Unless Engaged or Seriously Injured, must make at least 1 move action toward the nearest enemy, or Charge (Double) action against a visible enemy if one is within range.

#### After the Battle

Pass a Toughness test with a -2 modifier, or become addicted. Once addicted, can only be included in a crew if taking a dose. Pay 2D6x10 credits for anti-addiction chems to shake this addiction.

### Ghast

Roll a D6:<br />
**1:** Insanity.<br />
**2-5:** A random psychic power.<br />
**6:** Insanity and a random psychic power. <br />

Random psychic power (from this list or any universal discipline):<br />
**1:** Assail (Basic)<br />
**2:** Flame Blast (Basic), Continuous Effect<br />
**3:** Freeze Time (Double)<br />
**4:** Weapon Jinx (Simple)<br />
**5:** Terrify (Double)<br />
**6:** Quickening (Basic), Continuous Effect

#### After the Battle

Pass a Willpower test or suffer -1 Willpower. If the result is 12 (before modifiers), the mind is permanently damaged, gain Insanity at the start of all future battles.

### Icrotic Slime

Pass a characteristic test for each of the following to gain the increase:

- +D3” Movement
- +D3 Strength
- +D3 Toughness
- +D3 Initiative
- +D3 Attacks
- +D3 Cool

Reduce the following characteristics (unless already worse):

- 10+ Leadership
- 10+ Intelligence
- 10+ Willpower

#### After the Battle

Roll 2D6:

**2:** Immediately killed.<br />
**3-11:** Into Recovery.<br />
**12:** Suffer a Lasting Injury roll (re-roll 61-66).

### Kalma

Can be given to captives during the Rescue scenario. When making an action, roll 2D6 + Toughness. If the result is 11 or less, the action is wasted. On a 12+, the action is made as normal and the chem has no more effect.

### Obscura

Can be given to captives during the Rescue scenario.

- D6” Movement. Must move full distance, even if this would take them over the edge of a ledge or into B2B with an enemy (become Engaged). If the move is insufficient to reach B2B with the enemy fighter, stop 1” away.
- All weapons gain Reckless.

A fighter can try to shake off the effects in the End phase. Roll 2D6 + Toughness. On a 12+, the chem has no more effect. For the rest of the battle, only a single action may be performed per activation.

#### After the Battle

Pass a Toughness test, or become addicted. Once addicted, can only be included in a crew on a 4+ (prior to the battle). Pay 2D6x10 credits for anti-addiction chems to shake this addiction.

### ‘Slaught

- 2+ WS
- 2+ Initiative
- +1 Attack

#### After the Battle

Pass a Toughness test, or become addicted. Once addicted, reduce the following characteristics (unless worse):

- 5+ WS
- 5+ Initiative
- 1 Attack

If taking a new dose, the effects are reduced (no bonus to attacks):

- 3+ WS
- 3+ Initiative

Shake the addition by going into Recovery.

### Spur

- +2” Movement.
- 2+ Initiative

In each End-phase after taking the chem, roll 2D6 + Toughness. If the result is 10+, the chem has worn off.

### Stinger Mould

Must be used after suffering a Lasting Injury roll (other than Memorable Death) to ignore the result. Positive results are also ignored, such as 11 (Lesson Learned).

#### After the Battle

Alternatively, after the battle, roll a 5+ to remove an existing Lasting Injury.
