# Armoury & Trading Post

_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_


The following pages contain rules for all of the Weapons and Wargear available to
gangs and fighters in Necromunda.

~~Players should note that, unless they are included alongside special ammo types, the various weapons unique to the Clan Houses of Necromunda (such as the advanced las weapons of Van Saar or the iconic polearms of Cawdor) are not included in this list. Such weapons are available only to gangs belonging to the Houses that manufacture them and can be found within the gangâ€™s own equipment lists. Such weapons are not normally available through the Trading Post and gangs of rival Houses would not consider using such weapons. These weapons are so closely linked to the cultural identities of the Houses that using such a weapon is simply not done in Necromundan culture. Profiles and rules for these weapons can be found in the relevant supplements.~~

:::note

Unlike in the 2023 Core Rules, this Section lists _all_ items available in Necromunda.

This section includes everything from the Trading Post, gang lists and other sources such as gear unique to characters or scenarios.

Each page is divided into two sections: 'Trading Post' and 'Exclusive'. Trading Post items are available via the trading post, whereas Exclusive items are only available through other means (and are often restricted to a particular gang or fighter).

Items that are available on the Trading Post will be marked with their Availability Level (AL), such as C (Common), R9 (Rarity 9) or I6 (Illegal 6).

If an items is available to a gang via their gang list _cheaper_ than on the Trading Post, it is marked as follows. Note that you should reference your Gang Equipment list during gang creation, as some items are _more expensive_ on their gang lists.

| Profile  | ... | AL  | Credits |
| :------- | :-: | :-: | :-----: |
| Chainaxe | ... | R9  |  30\*   |

\* House Goliath: 25 Credits

Some items are were on a previous Trading Post but not listed in the 2023 Core Rules. These are marked as follows, and are listed in the 'Exclusive' section. Discuss with your arbitrator if these are available in your campaign:

| Profile  | ... | AL  | Credits |
| :------- | :-: | :-: | :-----: |
| Chainaxe | ... | R9^ |   30    |
