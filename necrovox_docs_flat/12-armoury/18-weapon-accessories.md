### Gunshroud (Basic Weapons And Pistols)

_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

A weapon fitted with a gunshroud gains the Silent trait.

### Hotshot Las Pack (Lasgun And Laspistol only)

**20 Credits**  
_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

At the expense of reliability, a lasgun or laspistol (not
including las carbines, las sub-carbines or suppression
lasers) can be fitted with a hotshot las pack, increasing
its Strength to 4 and Armour Piercing to -1. However, the weapon loses the Plentiful trait and its Ammo value
is reduced to 4+.

### Infra-Sight (Pistols, Basic, Special And Heavy Weapons)†

**40 Credits – Rare (8)**  
_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

Weapons with the Rapid Fire (X) or Blast (3"/5")
trait cannot be fitted with an infra-sight. A weapon
with an infra-sight can be used to attack through
smoke clouds, and increases the value of X" in the
Visibility (X") rule by 9". In addition, there is no hit
modifier when the weapon targets a fighter in partial
cover, and a -1 modifier (instead of -2) when it targets
a model in full cover.

### Las-Projector (Pistols, Basic And Special Weapons)

**35 Credits – Rare (9)**  
_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

The weapon’s Short range accuracy bonus is improved
by 1 (for example, if it is +1, it becomes +2; if it is -, it
becomes +1; if it is -1, it becomes -).

### Mono-Sight(Basic, Special And Heavy Weapons)†

**35 Credits – Rare (9)**  
_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

If a model attacks with this weapon after making an
Aim action, add 2 to the result of the hit roll instead
of 1.

### Psi-Amplifier (Melee Weapons)†

**75 Credits – Rare (15)**  
_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

In order for a psi-amplifier to be fitted to a weapon, a specialist must be found. To attempt to find one, Leaders and Champions may make the Psi Attune
post-battle action. This is carried out the same way as
a [Trade action](/docs/the-rules/the-post-battle-sequence#trade), though its only benefit
is if you roll a 15 or more for the Availability level, you
may fit the psi-amplifier to a weapon. Once fitted, the
weapon gains the Force trait.

### Suspensors (Weapons With the Unwieldy Trait Only)

**60 Credits – Rare (10)**  
_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

An Unwieldy ranged weapon fitted with suspensors
is far more manoeuvrable. Firing it becomes a Basic
action rather than a Double action.

An Unwieldy close combat weapon fitted with
suspensors can be used single-handedly, allowing the
fighter to use a second close combat weapon.

### Telescopic Sight (Pistols, Basic and Special Weapons)†

**25 Credits**  
_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

If a model attacks with this weapon after making
an Aim action, the weapon’s Short range accuracy
modifier is used even if the target is within the
weapon’s Long range.
