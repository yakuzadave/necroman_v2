# Mounts

For Mount rules, see the [Mounted](/docs/general-principles/conditions#mounted) condition.

Mounts can't be purchased for or be combined with the following:

- Vehicle crew.
- Ash Waste Nomads (except when the mount is included for the fighter).
- Wargear that affects movement (for example jump booster or grav-cutter).

:::note Vehicle Upgrades & Wargear

If all gangs agree, mounts can be customized by vehicle Upgrades & Wargear (up to one Upgrade per area). However Weapon Hardpoints cannot be added to a Mount (use the Custom Vehicle rules instead).
