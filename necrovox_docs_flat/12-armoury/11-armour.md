# Armour

Unless stated otherwise, a fighter may only be equipped with one type of armour at a time. However, certain types of armour can be combined with others. Where this is the case, the rules will state it.

## Trading Post Armour

### Ablative Overlay

**20 Credits**  
_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_


_Sometimes, the best way to improve a suit of armour is to add even more armour over the top. An ablative overlay is a layer of armour that can be worn in addition to another suit of armour, or can be worn on its own. It can range from sophisticated gel coatings and reactive plates, to more primitive furs quilted with ballistic cloth and fragments from ruined armour pieces._

The first time a fighter wearing an ablative
overlay is required to make a save, their save is 2
better than normal (i.e., a model with a 5+ save would
gain a 3+ save). A model without a save gains a 5+
save. The second time they must make a save, it
becomes 1 better than normal or 6+ if they did not
already have a save.

After the fighter has been hit twice, the ablative overlay is spent and has no further effect on the battle, but is retained by the fighter and may be used again in future battles.

### Archaeo-Carapace

**120 Credits – Rare (12)**

_An ancient device from the Dark Age of Technology, the Archaeo-carapace is a piston-driven rig that grafts itself to the user. It offers impressive protection, but at the same time slowly begins to take over the wearer, until there is little distinction between them and the machine._

An Archaeo-carapace grants its wearer a 4+ save.

If the wearer suffers a Lasting Injury
result of Humiliated, Head Injury, Eye Injury, Hand
Injury, Hobbled, Spinal Injury or Enfeebled, instead of
suffering the effects of the injury they gain a bionic (see [Bionics](/docs/armoury/bionics)) appropriate to the location damaged
(i.e., if a Head Injury was suffered, they would gain a
Cortex-cogitator bionic). These bionics do not increase
the fighter’s characteristics. Unlike normal bionics, they
cannot be damaged or destroyed, and if the fighter
suffers an injury to a location already replaced by a
bionic then the injury is ignored.

Transformation into a blasphemous cyber-creature is
not without its perils, however. Whenever the fighter
activates they must roll a D6. If the result is less than
the number of bionics they currently have, they gain
the Insane condition. If the fighter ever has six or more
bionics, they vanish into the underhive never to be
seen again – the player must remove the fighter from
their gang roster

### Armourweave

**20 Credits – Illegal (9)**  
_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_


_A product of xenos science, the armourweave suit combines psycho-reactive plastics and kinetic bafflers to deaden blows. Armourweave is also practically impossible to tear or cut, meaning even against the most powerful attacks it will offer some measure of protection._

Armourweave grants its wearer a save of 5+. This save cannot be reduced to lower than 6+ by AP
or other modifiers, though attacks that do not allow a
save will ignore Armourweave as normal.

### Carapace  

_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_


_Carapace armour falls into two broad categories. Light carapace armour offers good protection all over but falls short of covering the wearer from head to toe. Heavy carapace armour is a more complete suit of armour and offers extra protection._

**Light:** _80 credits – Rare (10)_ Light carapace armour
grants a 4+ save roll.

**Heavy:** _100 credits – Rare (11)_ Heavy carapace
armour grants a 4+ save roll. This is increased to 3+
against attacks originating within the fighter’s vision
arc (the 90° arc to their front); check this before the
fighter model is placed Prone and is Pinned. If it is not
clear if the attacker is within the fighter’s front arc, use
a Vision Arc template to check – if the centre of the
attacker’s base is within the arc, use the 3+ save roll. Against attacks with the Blast trait, use the centre of the Blast marker in place of the attacker. If the fighter
does not have a facing (for example, if they are prone), use the 4+ save roll. However, due to the extra weight of this armour, the fighter’s Initiative is reduced by -1 and
their movement by 1" when making a Charge action.

### Ceramite Shield

**40 Credits – Rare (8)**  
_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_


_Ceramite shields are made from scavenged armoured plating destined for the military vehicles of the Imperium. As much mobile cover as personal protection, they are lugged into battle by burly gangers who don’t mind the weight compared to the benefits the shield affords._

A fighter with a Ceramite shield adds +2 to their save against attacks originating in
their line of sight provided they are Standing, however
for the wielder the Move action becomes a (Basic)
action rather than a (Simple) action.

A fighter with a Ceramite shield ignores the effects of the Melta trait if
an attack originates in their line of sight. A fighter can
be equipped with a Ceramite shield in addition to a suit
of armour, however a fighter carrying a Ceramite shield
reduces the number of weapons they can carry by one.

### Flak

_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_


_Flak armour is perhaps the most common type seen in the underhive. Made with layers of thick, protective material bonded together, it offers protection against cuts and abrasions without hampering mobility. Certain improved types, however, are only readily available to Lord Helmawr’s Enforcers, though versions (sometimes with the blood of fallen Enforcers still on them) do appear on the Black Market._

**Flak Armour:** _10 credits_ Flak armour grants a 6+ save
roll. Against weapons that use a Blast marker or Flame
template, this is increased to a 5+ save roll.

### Gutterforged Cloak

**15 Credits**  
_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_


_Made from fragments of ruined armour, a Gutterforged cloak provides protection at a very modest price. Common among badzones settlers, the cloak is also designed to offer some measure of defence against the hazards of the underhive or ash wastes._

A Gutterforged
cloak grants its wearer a save of 6+, or a save of 5+
against damage resulting from Underhive Perils or
environmental effects.

### Hazard Suit

**10 Credits – Rare (10)**   
_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_


_The ash wastes are a hostile place, their dunes frequently toxic or corrosive, and strong winds whip up regular ash storms capable of blasting any exposed skin raw in minutes. Consequently, those such as ash crust miners and the poor wretches who maintain a hive’s outer armoured skin frequently wear heavy suits of rubberised canvas with vulcanised plates that protect them from the dangers of their working environment._

A hazard suit grants a 6+ save roll.

Additionally, when a hazard suit is combined with a
respirator, the fighter’s Toughness is increased by 3 against Gas attacks, rather than the usual 2. Finally, a fighter wearing a hazard suit is immune to the Blaze and Rad-phage traits.3

### Mantle Malifica

**75 Credits – Illegal (13)**  
_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_


_Constructed from pieces of gore-forged metal, a Mantle Malifica incorporates profane icons and Warp-infused materials to protect its wearer from harm. Unfortunately, wearing such a tainted garment will slowly erode the mind and soul of all but the most strong-willed – or those already insane._

A Mantle Malifica grants its wearer a 5+ save, or an unmodifiable 4+ save against the effects of psychic
powers.

Note that this save, if successful, does not cancel the use of a psychic power, it only renders the wearer immune to the power’s effects. In the End phase of each round, the wearer must make a Willpower test or gain the [Insane condition](/docs/general-principles/conditions#insane).

### Mesh Armour

**15 Credits**  
_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_


_Constructed from tiny metal rings linked together, mesh armour offers more protection than flak without sacrificing any of the wearer’s mobility. Worn in large quantities however, it can become extremely heavy._

Mesh armour grants a 5+ save roll.

### Reflec Shroud

**30 Credits – Rare (8)**  
_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_


_Created from layers of reflective metals, a reflec shroud provides an effective ward against energy weapons._

A reflec shroud grants its wearer a save of 5+.

The wearer also counts the AP of las, plasma and melta weapons as ‘-’ regardless of their actual AP.

### Scrap Shield

**15 Credits**  
_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_


_Sometimes, fighters fashion crude shields from bits of barricades or simply panels prised from tunnel walls. These are then painted in gang colours and affixed to other suits of armour, either strapped to an arm or mounted over a shoulder._

A fighter can be equipped with a scrap shield in addition to a suit of armour. The scrap shield offers no protection against ranged attacks, but while Standing and Engaged, the fighter increases their save by 1 against Reaction attacks.

## Exclusive Armour

### Armoured Bodyglove

**Van Saar only**  
_Source: House of Artifice_

The fighters of House Van Saar are somewhat protected from the effects of their own rad weapons by their armour and are therefore immune to the effects of the Rad-phage Weapon Trait (i.e., they will not suffer the additional Flesh Wound) unless otherwise noted.

In addition, if a fighter is wearing an armoured bodyglove, their save roll is improved by 1. For example, if they are wearing flak armour and an armoured bodyglove, they would have a 5+ save, which would be increased to 4+ against Blasts. If a fighter does not already have a save roll, an armoured bodyglove grants a 6+ save.

Unlike other types of armour, an armoured bodyglove may be combined with other types of armour. It may not, however, be combined with an armoured undersuit.

### Armoured Undersuit

See [Personal Equipment: Armoured Undersuit](/docs/armoury/personal-equipment#armoured-undersuit).

### Furance Plates

6+ save (5+ in the front vision arc).

### Flak (Hardened, Layered)

**Hardened Flak Armour:** 6+ save (5+ against Blast/Template). Reduce the AP by 1 (to a minimum of -1).

**Layered Flak Armour:** 5+ save (4+ against Blast/Template).

**Hardened Layered Flak Armour:** 5+ save (4+ against Blast/Template). Reduce the AP by 1 (to a minimum of -1).

### Plate Mail

Plate mail grants a 6+ save roll. This is increased to a 5+ save roll against attacks
originating within the fighter’s vision arc (the 90° arc to their front); check this
before the fighter model is placed Prone and is Pinned.

If it is not clear if the
attacker is within the fighter’s front arc, use a Vision Arc template to check – if the
centre of the attacker’s base is within the arc, use the 5+ save roll. Against attacks
with the Blast trait, plate mail always grants a 5+ save roll.

### Shield (Energy/Assault)

- Melee attacks: +2 front.
- Ranged attacks: +1 front.

:::note

This is a close combat weapon (Str S, Knockback).
