# Field Armour

Any fighter may wear one or more types of field armour. These provide an alternative to conventional armour and may be worn as well as conventional armour. The save they offer cannot be modified by a weapon’s Armour Piercing value. However, a fighter can only make one save attempt per attack, therefore the controlling player must choose to either make a save attempt using the fighter’s armour save, or using a field.

### Conversion Field

_A conversion field works by transforming the kinetic energy of an attack into light energy, absorbing the impact in a blinding flash._

When a fighter wearing a conversion field is hit by an attack, roll a D6. On a
5+, the conversion field works and the attack has
no further effect. However, any fighters, friend or
foe, within 3" of the wearer count as being hit by a
weapon with the Flash trait as the field flares up in
a tremendous burst of light. Note that the wearer is
unaffected by this flash of light as they are inside
the field.

### Displacer Field

_A displacer field reacts to the energy of an impact by teleporting the wearer a safe distance away. The harder the impact, the further the wearer will be moved._

For each hit a fighter wearing a displacer field
suffers, roll a D6. On a 4+, the fighter is protected from
harm by the field and the hit is ignored (even if any part
of the fighter is still under the template – if the attack
used one – after being displaced as described below).

- If a fighter is saved from one or more hits by a
  displacer field, they will be moved once as the field
  displaces them. The fighter is moved a number
  of inches equal to the Strength of the attack
  in a random direction, determined by rolling a
  Scatter dice.
- A displacer field will not deposit its wearer inside a
  terrain feature – the fighter will move by the shortest
  route possible so that it can be placed clear of any
  impassable terrain features.
- Similarly, the fighter’s base cannot overlap another
  fighter’s base and the wearer must be moved by the
  shortest route possible until its base can be placed
  without overlapping.
- Note that the wearer may not end up within 1" of
  an enemy fighter as a result of being displaced and
  must be moved by the shortest possible route so
  that they can be placed 1" away.

However, displacer fields are notoriously oblivious
to safe footings. A fighter wearing a displacer field
may simply be flung into the open air. If, after being
displaced, any part of the fighter’s base is overhanging
a hazard or overhanging a platform edge, the fighter
must pass an Initiative test or will fall, following all
of the rules for falling as required by the terrain type
being fought over. If the entirety of the fighter’s base is
over a hazard or in the open air, they will simply fall.

If a fighter wearing a displacer field is transported
off the battlefield, they immediately go Out of Action. Do not roll on the Lasting Injury chart, they are
automatically Out Cold.

If an attack does not have a Strength value, then a
displacer field cannot work against it.

### Refractor Field

_A refractor field bends the energy of an attack around the wearer, harmlessly distributing it over a large area and robbing the attack of its lethal force._

When a
fighter wearing a refractor field is hit by an attack, roll a
D6. On a 5+, the hit is ignored.

However, should the field work and the hit be ignored, roll another D6. If the result is a 1, then the field has
been overburdened by the attack and its generator
is burned out. Remove the refractor field from the
fighter’s card – it no longer works.
