# Personal Equipment

This section covers equipment carried by fighters to help them survive the rigours
of battle and the harsh environments of the underhive and ash wastes. As well
as the equipment readily available in the Trading Post, fighters make use of more
outlandish items found in the badzones, and many are not above using illegal items
secured through underhanded means.

## Trading Post Personal Equipment

### Archaeotech Device

**120 Credits – Rare (13)**  
_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

_The underhive is filled with ancient treasures, strange objects from previous ages and wondrous technological devices Mankind has long since lost the ability to create. Of course, these rare pieces of archaeotech, as they are known, are hidden beneath thousands of years of debris and waste, and even should a fighter be fortunate enough to find a genuine archaeotech device, they still need to figure out how it works._

When a player buys an Archaeotech Device from the Trading Post, they won’t know
what it does. They must allocate it to one of their fighters and roll on the Archaeotech
Device table to determine its type. If an Archaeotech Device is given to a different
fighter in the gang for any reason, the new fighter must pass an Intelligence test the
first time they wish to activate it. If they pass, they may use the device as normal
from now on. If they fail, they must wait until their next battle to try to activate the
device again.

| D6  | Type           | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

|  1  | Dangerous      | _The fighter accidentally triggers the device as they’re messing about with it._ They immediately go into Recovery and the archaeotech is reduced to a pile of worthless molten slag.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|  2  | Viewer         | _The fighter can use the device to view different places, shifting their perspective to almost any point, even if it’s beyond closed doors and solid walls._ A fighter with this device can make the Scan (Simple) action to place a Revealed marker on an enemy fighter within 18". If the fighter is selected to be a sentry, when they are activated, roll a D6 for them. On a 6, they automatically raise the alarm as they spot the enemy sneaking around.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|  3  | Cutting Beam   | _The device can be used to focus a cutting beam of great power on a stationary object. Unfortunately, it’s useless as a weapon because both the target and the fighter have to be perfectly still for the beam to focus, but it makes for a good can opener!_ A fighter with this device can make the Laser Cut (Double) action if they are within 1" of a door, loot casket or other damageable piece of terrain. This action inflicts a single automatic hit against the chosen target, resolved with Strength 8 and Damage 3.                                                                                                                                                                       |
|  4  | Lifter         | _The device is a sophisticated form of suspensor which can negate or lessen gravity for its bearer, allowing them to float up or down for a limited period._ When making a Move or Charge action, the fighter ignores all terrain, may move freely between levels without restriction, and can never fall. They may not, however, ignore impassable terrain or walls, and may not end their movement with their base overlapping an obstacle or another fighter’s base.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|  5  | Holo Projector | _The device functions as a holo projector and can be used to make the fighter appear a short distance away from where they really are._ This gives the fighter a 4+ field armour save. As soon as the saving throw is failed, the projector stops working for the rest of the battle. Also note that the holo projector is useless against close combat attacks and weapons with the Template or Blast traits.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|  6  | Weapon         | _The device is a powerful and compact weapon. It is only pistol-sized but it is as effective as a much larger piece of ordnance._ Roll a D6 to find out what it is:<table><thead><tr><td>D6</td><td>Result</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1-2</td><td>Boltgun</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Flamer</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Meltagun</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Plasma gun</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Grenade launcher with frag grenades.</td></tr></tbody></table>The weapon has the standard profile for a weapon of its type but with the addition of the Sidearm trait. Because the weapon is compact and self- maintaining it can be used by anyone, not just Specialists, Champions or Leaders. |

### Armoured Undersuit

**25 Credits – Rare (7)**  
_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

An armoured undersuit may be worn in addition to any armour type, with the exception of an armoured bodyglove.

If a fighter is wearing an armoured
undersuit, their save roll is improved by 1. For example,
if they are wearing flak armour and an armoured
undersuit, they would have a 5+ save, which would be
increased to 4+ against Blasts. If a fighter does not
already have a save roll, an armoured undersuit grants
a 6+ save.

### Bio-Booster

**35 Credits – Rare (8)**  
_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

The first time in each battle that an Injury roll is made
for a fighter with a bio-booster, one less Injury dice is
rolled. If only one dice was being rolled, two dice are
rolled and the player controlling the fighter with the biobooster can discard one of them.

### Bio-Scanner

**30 Credits – Rare (8)**  
_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

If a fighter with a [bio-scanner](/docs/armoury/personal-equipment#bio-scanner) is a sentry in a scenario
that uses the Sentries special rule, they can attempt
to spot attackers even if the attackers are not within
their vision arc. In addition, the D6 roll to see whether
a fighter is spotted has a +1 modifier (a natural 1
still fails).

### Blind Snake Pouch

**60 Credits – Rare (12)**  
_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

_Sump shamans are strange underhive mystics believed to be able to commune with the spirits of the hive. Whether or not this is true, the fetishes they make are highly sought after and reputed to be able to protect a fighter from harm._

A fighter with a Blind Snake Pouch gains the Dodge skill. If they already have the Dodge skill then they will successfully dodge attacks on a D6 roll of 5 or 6 rather than just a roll of 6. In addition, when making a dodge against an attack made by a fighter using the [Overwatch](/docs/gang-fighters-and-their-weaponry/skills/#6-overwatch) skill, the dodge will succeed on a D6 roll of 4, 5 or 6.

### Cameleoline Cloak

**35 Credits – Rare (9)**  
_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

_Cameleoline is a much sought-after material within the Imperium, and is commonly used by the armies of the Emperor for stealth and scout troops. On Necromunda, some examples of the material can be found in the underhive, stitched into more common clothing or as an extra layer on a cloak, allowing the wearer to seemingly vanish if they stand still._

If the wearer of a
Cameleoline cloak did not move during their activation, ranged attacks made against them suffer a -2 to hit
until the start of their next activation.

### Chem-Synth

**15 Credits – Rare (12)**  
_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

At the start of their activation, a Standing and Active
or Standing and Engaged fighter with a chem-synth
can choose to make an Intelligence test. If the test is
passed, any Gas or Toxin weapons they use until the
end of their activation are enhanced and the target's
Toughness is treated as being 1 lower when resolving
those attacks.

### Chrono-Crystal

**500 Credits – Illegal (14)**  
_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

_The opportunity to acquire one of Bald Bryen’s Chronocrystals is vanishingly rare, and possession of such an item will not only result in the owner earning the eternal enmity of the infamous mayor of Rust Town, but may also lead to them crossing paths with the Ordo Chronos in the future (or, perhaps, in the past…)._

Certain scenario special rules will detail the ways in which a Chrono-crystal can be used.

### Cred Sniffer

**35 Credits – Rare (8)**  
_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

_Cred Sniffers are modified auspexes created by enterprising archaeo-thieves. They literally sniff out the rare alloys in cred chits and direct the user to their location._

If a fighter equipped with a Cred Sniffer was
part of a battle and was not taken Out of Action or
Prone and Seriously Injured, at the end of the battle
they earn 4D6 credits for their gang. A gang can only
benefit from the effects of one Cred Sniffer at a time.

### Cult Icon

_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

Unlike other items of Wargear, a gang may only
purchase a single Cult Icon. This item must be carried
by a fighter with both the Gang Hierarchy (X) and
Group Activation (X) special rules. When a fighter that
is carrying a Cult Icon uses the Group Activation (X)
special rule, they may activate one additional Ready
friendly fighter, meaning that a fighter with the Group
Activation (2) special rule may activate three additional
fighters, whilst a fighter with the Group Activation (1)
special rule may activate two additional fighters.

### Data-Thief

**35 Credits – Illegal (10)**  
_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

_Data-thief slates monitor enemy comms and farm useful information from Necromunda’s various vox- nets._

If a crew includes at least one fighter equipped
with a Data-thief, at the start of the battle they can make their opponent randomly reveal one of their gang tactics.

### Dome Runner Map

**100 Credits – Rare (9)**  
_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_  
_(previously called the Ratskin map - RIP Ratskins)_

_Dome Runners often map out sections of the hive based on their extensive explorations. These maps are jealousy guarded by individual Dome Runners, often written in code and covered with strange symbols marking out hidden stashes or secret pathways to lost sections of the underhive. Rarely, one of these maps might fall into the hands of an underhive trader, though copies and fakes are common, some leading to great treasures, others perilous badzones._

Before a gang with a Dome Runner Map
rolls to determine the scenario as part of the
pre-battle sequence, they can declare they are using
their Dome Runner Map. If both gangs have a Dome
Runner Map, they should roll off to see whose gang
gets to use theirs for this battle – capitalising on the
map’s information before their opponent can. The
player then rolls on the Dome Runner Map table to see
how valuable the information on it is. Note, once the
type of map is determined, it remains the same, and
provided it is worth something, a gang may use it again
in the pre-battle sequence of subsequent battles.

#### Dome Runner Map Table

| D6  | Type                | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| :-: | :------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  1  | Fake                | Instead of rolling for the scenario as normal, your opponent chooses the scenario for this battle. Remove the Dome Runner Map from your gang roster.                                                        |
|  2  | Worn and Incomplete | After making the roll to determine the scenario, you may add or subtract 1 from the result.                                                                                                                 |
|  3  | Treasure Map        | Roll another D6. On a 1-5, the map is a Fake (see above). On a 6, it is a genuine treasure map. If your gang wins the scenario, they can add D6x20 credits to their Stash in addition to any other rewards. |
|  4  | Ancient and Faded   | After making the roll to determine the scenario, you may add or subtract 2 from the result.                                                                                                                 |
|  5  | Secret Pathways     | D3 fighters in your gang gain the Infiltrate skill for the duration of this scenario.                                                                                                                       |
|  6  | Recent and Accurate | After making the roll to determine the scenario, you may add or subtract up to 3 from the result.                                                                                                           |

### Drop Rig

**10 Credits**  
_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

An Active fighter with a drop rig can make the Descend (Basic) action while they are within 1" of the edge of
a platform:

**Descend (Basic):** The fighter makes a move of
up to 3" horizontally and up to 12" vertically. Any
vertical movement must be downwards, i.e., towards
the ground.

### Falsehood

**40 Credits – Rare (9)**  
_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

_When this device is activated it projects a distortion field that changes the wearer’s appearance, making them appear as someone else._

A fighter equipped
with a Falsehood cannot be targeted by ranged or
melee attacks or enemy psychic powers, and will not
cause the alarm to be raised if spotted by a sentry in
a battle using the Sneak Attack rules. These effects
last until the fighter makes a melee or ranged attack, uses a psychic power on an enemy fighter, or until
the End phase of the second round. At this point their
suspicious or openly hostile acts give them away, the
illusion is dispelled and the hood has no further effect.

### Filter Plugs

**10 Credits**  
_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

If a fighter with filter plugs is hit by a weapon with the
Gas trait, their Toughness is increased by 1 for the
purposes of the roll to see whether they are affected. Filter plugs are one use; if a fighter uses them during a
battle, they are removed from their Fighter card when
the battle ends.

### Frenzon Collar

**30 Credits – Rare (9)**  
_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

_A method of control, the Frenzon collar is usually found clamped around the necks of unwilling penal troopers, where its cocktail of combat drugs drives them into battle at the behest of their masters. Underhive gangers sometimes wear these collars willingly into combat, or as part of a dare._

A fighter equipped with a Frenzon collar is considered to be permanently under
the effects of Frenzon (see [Chems: Frenzon](/docs/armoury/chems#frenzon)).

In addition, each collar comes with a master motivator. At the start
of the battle, the player must decide if their Leader
or one of their Champions is carrying the master
motivator. When the Leader or Champion with the
master motivator makes a group activation, they may
include models wearing Frenzon collars (up to the
normal number of fighters they may group activate)
regardless of where they are on the battlefield. Note
that if a gang includes more than one fighter equipped
with a Frenzon collar, they will only ever have a single
master motivator which governs all collars in the gang.

### Forged Guilder Seal

**55 Credits – Illegal (11)**  
_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

_Truly decent forged documents are a rarity in the underhive, and ones good enough for a ganger to pass themselves off as a Guilder even more so – though they do exist. Only the boldest criminals pretend to be Guilders, however, for the consequences of being discovered and caught involves a long and painful execution._

When a fighter with a Forged Guilder Seal
visits the Trading Post, they reduce the Rarity of
Items by 2. In addition, the prices of any items they
buy are reduced by 3D6 credits to a minimum of 10
credits. However, if they roll a double 1 or double 6
when reducing the price of an item, they have been
discovered. The item is bought as normal, however, the
seal is then removed from their Fighter card, and the
fighter’s gang are declared Outlaws.

### Grapnel Launcher

**25 Credits**  
_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

An Active fighter with a grapnel launcher can make the
following action:

**Grapnel (Double):** The fighter can move up to 12" in
a straight line, in any direction. This move can take
them to a different level, as long as they do not move
through any terrain.

### Grav-Chute

**50 Credits – Rare (10)**  
_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

If a fighter with a grav-chute falls or jumps down to
a lower level, they do not suffer any damage – they
simply move down without any rolls being made.

### Halo Device

**250 Credits – Illegal (14)**  
_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

_From the forlorn regions beyond the edge of the Imperium, intrepid Rogue Traders sometimes bring back strange objects. Known as Halo devices, these alien artefacts are often imbued with ancient energies, able to sustain their owners even beyond death, though often at a cost to others._

When a fighter
equipped with a Halo device suffers a Lasting Injury
(including Memorable Death), their player can choose
another member of their gang to suffer all the effects
of the Lasting Injury instead (treat the fighter equipped
with the Halo device as having suffered the Out Cold
result instead). Note that if the fighter was taken Out of
Action they are still removed from the battle, while the
fighter chosen to suffer the Lasting Injury remains on
the battlefield unless the result was a 61-66, in which
case they are removed.

### Harrier-Skulls

**40 Credits – Rare (8)**  
_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

_With every innovation in combat there is usually a counter-innovation to defeat it. Harrier-skulls are a kind of servo-skull designed to act as decoys for Grapplehawks and other hunting beasts._

If an Exotic
Beast wants to make an attack against a fighter
equipped with Harrier-skulls, it must first pass an
Intelligence test – otherwise the Attack action fails
and is wasted. If the owner of the Exotic Beast is within
3" of the target of the attack, the beast may use its
owner’s Intelligence for the test instead.

### Hexagrammic Fetish

**35 Credits – Rare (10)**  
_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

Badzone peddlers and sumphole wise women often sell charms and fetishes ‘guaranteed’ to offer protection. The truly astonishing thing is some of these charms actually work!

When a fighter buys a Hexagrammic Fetish, they must roll a D6. On a 1, the
fetish is rubbish, though the fighter can sell it on to an
unsuspecting underhiver for 3D6 credits. On a 2-5,
it has some power, and if a Psyker targets the fighter
with a psychic power, the Psyker suffers a -1 to their
Willpower test. On a 6, the fetish has some real juice;
it works as above except the Psyker will suffer a -3 to
their Willpower test.

### Holochromatic Field

**100 Credits – Illegal (9)**  
_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

_A Holochromatic field surrounds its wearer in an aura of scintillating colours._

Ranged attacks against
a fighter with a Holochromatic field suffer a -2 to hit,
while melee attacks against them suffer a -1 to hit.
Each time the fighter is targeted with an attack, roll a
D6. On a 1, the Holochromatic field has been drained
and has no effect for the rest of this battle. Fighters
wearing an active Holochromatic field count as always
having a revealed marker on them in scenarios using
the Pitch Black rules. A Holochromatic field cannot be
combined with Cameleoline Cloaks or similar devices
that make the wearer harder to see.

### Industrial Respirator

**30 Credits – Rare (7)**  
_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

_Respirators are a common sight in the underhive, offering some measure of protection against airborne hazards. Most are ancient things, their filters clogged with years of filth and barely functioning. Sometimes gangers might get their hands on a batch of newly minted respirators, and even some of the rare heavy industrial breathing apparatus reserved for Helmawr’s personal guard or outerhive work crews._

An Industrial Respirator adds 3 to a
fighter’s Toughness, or 4 if combined with a Hazard
Suit, against attacks from weapons with the Gas
trait. In addition, an Industrial Respirator contains
a limited air supply. Once per battle, when a fighter
with an Industrial Respirator is activated, they can
declare they are using its air supply. Until the fighter is
activated again, they gain immunity to Gas attacks, can
act normally while on fire (though they may still take
damage) and may ignore effects keyed to breathing or
air quality.

### Lho Sticks

**5 Credits**  
_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

_A fighter equipped with lho sticks is considered to be ‘cool’ by the more gullible members of their gang._

Any friendly fighter with an Intelligence characteristic of
8+ or worse may use this fighter’s Cool characteristic
instead of their own if they are within 6" and line of
sight of this fighter.

### Lock-Punch

**10 Credits**  
_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

_Lock-punches are crude pneumatic devices used to smash locks out of doors and force them open._

A fighter equipped with a lock-punch can use it
when they are taking the [Force Door (Basic)](/docs/the-rules/fighter-actions#force-door-basic) action to add 4 to their Strength. Doors
opened with lock-punches are permanently damaged
and must be removed from the battlefield.

### Magnacles

**20 Credits**  
_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

_Used by both the Adeptus Arbites and local Enforcers across the Imperium, Magnacles are magnetic shackles for locking prisoners in place._

A fighter equipped with Magnacles can try to lock them onto an
enemy in base contact as an Attack (Basic) action. The
target must make an Initiative test to avoid the attack.
If this test is failed they are locked in place and cannot
move, cannot make ranged attacks and can only make
melee attacks at -2 to hit. The target can attempt to
free themselves by performing a Break Bonds (Double)
action. Roll 2D6. If the result is equal or lower than
their Strength then they have freed themselves, otherwise they remain trapped. Each friendly fighter in
base contact with the target adds 2 to their Strength
for the purposes of this roll.

### Malefic Artefact

**90 Credits – Illegal (13)**  
_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

_Malefic Artefacts are objects of the Warp or those that have lingered in the hands of corrupted individuals._

When a player buys a Malefic Artefact from the Trading Post, they won’t know what it does. They must allocate it to one
of their fighters and roll a D6 on the Malefic Artefacts table to determine its type. If a Malefic Artefact is later
given to a different fighter in the gang for any reason, the new fighter must pass an Intelligence test the first time
they wish to activate it. If they pass, they may use the artefact as normal from now on. If they fail, they wait until
their next battle to try to activate the artefact again.

#### Malefic Artefacts Table

| D6  | Type               | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| :-: | :----------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  1  | Cursed Artefact    | The fighter accidentally triggers the artefact as they’re messing about with it. The Malefic Artefact mysteriously vanishes and the fighter begins their next battle with the Insane condition.                                                                                                                                                                 |
|  2  | Whisper Vox        | Hidden truths issue forth from the artefact, informing its bearer as to the intentions of those around them. The fighter gains the [Overwatch](/docs/gang-fighters-and-their-weaponry/skills/#6-overwatch) skill. If they already have the Overwatch skill, they can take the Aim (Basic) action in addition to the Shoot (Basic) action when using this skill. |
|  3  | Void Gate          | The artefact is a gateway to a dark yawning void that the fighter may open to sap the strength of those around them. The fighter can perform the Unleash the Void (Double) action. If they take this action, for the remainder of the round, all other fighters within 6" of them can only take a single action during their activation.                        |
|  4  | Aetheric Lantern   | When the artefact is activated, it acts as a beacon to the denizens of the Warp who would feast upon the dead and dying. The fighter can perform the Ignite Aetheric Lantern (Double) action. If they do, any Prone and Seriously Injured fighter within 12" of them must pass a Toughness check or go Out of Action.                                           |
|  5  | Chronoscope        | Time works differently around the artefact, sometimes speeding up, sometimes slowing down. When the fighter activates, roll a D6. On a 1, they may take no actions this round. On a 2-5, they can take an extra action this round. On a 6, after they complete their activation they may be placed anywhere within 12" of their current location.               |
|  6  | Terror Telepathica | Dire thoughts are projected from the artefact driving all those nearby mad. The fighter gains immunity to the Insane condition. Any other fighter that activates within 6" of the fighter must immediately pass a Willpower test or gain the Insane condition.                                                                                                  |

### Medicae Kit

**30 Credits – Rare (9)**  
_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

When a fighter with a medicae kit assists a friendly fighter’s Recovery test, roll an extra Injury dice then choose
one to discard.

### Mnemonic Inload Spike

**100 Credits – Illegal (12)**  
_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

_Adeptus Mechanicus Tech-Priests use Mnemonic Inload Spikes for the swift transfer of data from one cortex to the next. Each spike contains potential secrets and skills that the user can inload directly to their brain, though for those without the proper cybernetic interfaces the process can be fatal._

When a gang buys an inload spike, they must choose one of their fighters to attempt to use its data. The chosen fighter must immediately roll on the
Lasting Injuries table (re-roll any results of Bitter Enmity or Captured). If the fighter is still alive after making this
roll they gain one skill of their choice from Agility, Brawn, Combat, Cunning, Ferocity, Leadership, Savant or
Shooting. The spike is then used up and removed from the gang’s stash.

### Photo-Goggles

**35 Credits – Rare (9)**  
_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

A model with photo-goggles can attack through smoke
clouds, increases the value of X" in the Visibility (X")
rule by 9" and may gain other benefits in low light
conditions, depending upon the scenario. In addition,
if they are hit by a Flash weapon, add 1 to the result
of any test to see whether they become subject to the
Blind condition.

### Photo-Lumen

**20 Credits**  
_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

Commonly carried by Palanite Enforcers, a model that is equipped with a photo-lumen increases the value
of X" in the Visibility (X") rule by 9". However, when the
Visibility (X") rules are in effect, a fighter equipped with
a photo-lumen cannot be Hidden – they are instead
always subject to the Revealed condition due to the
bright light emanating from their gear.

### Psi-Grub

**50 Credits – Illegal (12)**  
_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

_Psi-grubs are alien parasites that feed upon psychic power. When bloated with the energies of the Immaterium, they can then be used to fuel psychic abilities._

Whenever a fighter with a Psi-grub uses a
psychic power or is the target of a psychic power, place
a Psi-grub token on their Fighter card after working
out the effects of the power. Once there is at least
one Psi-grub token on the fighter’s card, they can
attempt to use the Psi-grub whenever they manifest a
psychic power.

To trigger the Psi-grub, the fighter makes a Tap Psi-grub
(Basic) Action and rolls a D6. If the result is equal to
or lower than the number of Psi-grub tokens on their
Fighter card, the Psi-grub is triggered, otherwise there
is no effect. When the Psi-grub is triggered, remove all
Psi-grub tokens from the fighter’s card and immediately
use one of the fighter’s psychic powers just as if they
had taken a Wyrd Power (X) action (see [Using Wyrd Powers](/docs/the-rules/psykers#using-wyrd-powers)). This action does not require the fighter to make a
Willpower test.

If there are ever six tokens on the fighter’s card, the
Psi-grub immediately explodes! Remove all the tokens
and the Psi-grub from the fighter’s card and roll an
Injury dice for the fighter.

### Respirator

**15 Credits**  
_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

When a model with a respirator is hit by a weapon
with the Gas trait, their Toughness is increased by
2 for the purposes of the roll to see whether they
are affected.

### Sanctioning Writ

**25 Credits – Illegal (10)**  
_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

_A Sanctioning Writ is an official document penned and signed by the Merchants Guild granting its bearer the right to set bounties on the enemies of Necromunda. Sometimes, these are stolen from Guilders – signed but without the subject of the Bounty filled in – and are used by gangs to put an official target on their rivals._

A fighter can use a Sanctioning Writ to place a Bounty
on any member of a Law Abiding gang (see [Claim Bounties](/docs/the-rules/the-post-battle-sequence#claim-bounties)). This Bounty remains in place until it is fulfilled, the targeted fighter dies or the campaign comes to
an end. A Sanctioning Writ can only be used once, after which
it is lost, and a fighter can only have one Bounty on
their head at a time.

### Second Best

**15 Credits**  
_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

_Second Best, as the name suggests, is what you drink when you don’t have the creds for anything better. The exact contents of a bottle of Second Best vary from settlement to settlement, but are usually a cocktail of drinking-hole dregs, fermented fungi and gun oil (to make it go down smooth!). A few swigs of Second Best will bolster a fighter’s courage, but too much can lead to blindness, unconsciousness and even death._

A fighter with a bottle of Second Best can make the
Take a Swig (Simple) action. After they take this action, roll a D6. On a 1, 2 or 3, the bottle is empty; remove it
from the fighter’s card. Every time a fighter makes this
action, place an Intoxicated marker on their card and
remove one of their Flesh Wounds (if they have any).
Intoxicated markers remain until the end of the battle. The effects of the booze are dependent on how many
markers they have on their card.

#### Second Best Intoxication Table

| Intoxicated Markers | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| :-----------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|          1          | **Feeling Good:** -1 to ranged attack hit rolls, +1 to the result of Cool tests.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|          2          | **Getting Unsteady:** -2 to ranged attack hit rolls, +2 to the result of Cool tests. If the fighter makes two Move actions in a row, they must pass an Initiative test after completing the second action or become Prone and Pinned.                                              |
|         3+          | **Blind Drunk:** -3 to ranged attack hit rolls and -1 to melee attack hit rolls, +3 to the result of Cool tests. When the fighter makes a Move action, instead of using the fighter’s Movement characteristic, move the fighter D6" in a direction determined by the Scatter dice. |

### Servo Harness

_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

Usually seen in manufactoria, cargo haulage and storage depots, a servo harness greatly enhances the wearer’s
strength and endurance, taking the load off their own body and onto itself. Unsurprisingly, many gang fighters find
these benefits appealing in their line of work.

**Partial:** _130 credits – Rare (12)_ A fighter wearing a
partial servo harness gains a +2 modifier to their
Strength characteristic and a +1 modifier to their
Toughness characteristic. This may take them
above their maximum characteristics but it is not a
permanent increase and will be lost should the servo
harness be lost or cease to function for any reason. Additionally, a fighter wearing a partial servo harness
gains the benefits of suspensors on any Unwieldy
weapon they carry. However, a fighter wearing a partial
servo harness reduces their Movement and Initiative
by 1. This item cannot be combined with a servo claw
or any other type of servo harness.

**Full:** _160 credits – Rare (12)_ A fighter wearing a full
servo harness gains all of the benefits of a partial
servo harness, but without the negative modifiers
to Movement and Initiative. This item cannot be
combined with a servo claw or any other type of
servo harness.

### Skinblade

**10 Credits**  
_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

If the fighter is Captured at the end of a battle, they
can use their skinblade to attempt to escape. If they do
then add +2 to the dice roll to escape, if the attempt
is successful then the skinblade is lost and removed
from their Fighter card.

### Stimm-Slug Stash

**30 Credits – Rare (7)**  
_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

Once per battle, a fighter with a stimm-slug stash
can use it at the start of their activation. Immediately
discard one Flesh Wound from the fighter’s card,
if any are present. Until the end of the round, the
fighter’s Move, Strength and Toughness characteristics
are each increased by 2. At the start of the End phase, roll a D6. On a 1, the stimm overload is too much – roll
an Injury dice and apply the result to the fighter.

### Strip Kit

**15 Credits**  
_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

When a fighter with a strip kit makes an Intelligence
test to operate a door terminal or bypass the lock on a
loot casket, add 2 to the result.

### Suspensor Harness

**40 Credits – Rare (9)**  
_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

_Underhivers are nothing if not resourceful when it comes to repurposing gear for their needs. The suspensor harness is such a device, a collection of belts and components from a heavy weapon suspensor array allowing the wearer to carry excessive amounts of equipment. While Guilder slaves and Badzones prospectors might use them to carry heavy loads, gangers mainly use them to sling extra weapons on their back._

A fighter equipped with a suspensor harness may carry
four weapons rather than three, while a Hired Gun
Bounty Hunter with a suspensor harness may carry six
weapons rather than five. As usual, weapons marked
on the Equipment List with (\*) take up the space of
two weapons.

### Threadneedle Worms

**45 Credits – Illegal (13)**  
_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

Threadneedle worms are a deadly bio-weapon able to ravage an area of life in seconds. The lethality of Threadneedle worms makes them an ideal weapon of last resort for gangers who don’t care about collateral damage.

A fighter equipped with Threadneedle worms
can unleash them by taking the **Can of Worms (Basic)** action. Threadneedle worms can only be used once, after which they are removed from the fighter’s card. When Threadneedle worms are used, roll a D6 on the
Threadneedle Worms table.

#### Threadneedle Worms Table

| D6  | Result                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| :-: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  1  | **The Worms Turn:** Roll an Injury dice for the fighter using the Threadneedle Worms.                                                                                                                                                          |
| 2-3 | **A Few Live Worms:** Place a 5" Blast marker anywhere within D6" of the fighter then roll an Injury dice for each fighter under the marker.                                                                                                   |
| 4-5 | **A Few More Live Worms:** Place a 5" Blast marker anywhere within D6" of the fighter, then place two additional 5" Blast markers so they are in contact with the first marker. Roll an Injury dice for each fighter under any of the markers. |
|  6  | **A Can Full of Worms:** Roll an Injury dice for every enemy fighter on the battlefield, treating Out of Action results as Seriously Injured.                                                                                                  |

### Web Solvent

**25 Credits – Rare (8)**  
_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

When a fighter equipped with web solvent makes a Recovery check due to the
Webbed condition, roll an extra Injury dice, picking one of the dice to resolve it and
discarding the other. Additionally, when a fighter equipped with web solvent assists a
fighter subject to the Webbed condition with a Recovery test, roll an extra two Injury
dice and choose which one to apply.

### Wild Snake

**30 Credits**  
_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

_About the ‘finest’ booze around, Wild Snake is the go-to drink for underhivers with creds in their pocket and an iron liver. Each bottle contains the skinned and pickled remains of a ‘snake’, giving the liquor both its name and a sharp bitter taste on account of the snake venom. Gangs prize bottles of Wild Snake both because it is a quick and easy path to inebriation, but also because of the fabled ‘Snake Courage’ it can imbue!_

A fighter with a bottle of Wild Snake can make the Take a Swig (Simple) action. After
they make this action, roll a D6. On a 1 or 2, the bottle is empty; remove it from the
fighter’s card. Every time a fighter makes this action, place an Intoxicated marker
on their card and remove one of their Flesh Wounds (if they have any). Intoxicated
markers remain until the end of the battle. The effects of the booze are dependent
on how many markers they have on their card:

#### Wild Snake Intoxication Table

|          2          | **Seeing Double:** -1 to ranged attack hit rolls, +3 to the result of Cool tests. When making ranged attack hit rolls after choosing a target, randomise the actual target of the attack between the intended target and any model (friend or foe) within 6" of them. |
|         3+          | **Snake Courage!:** -2 to ranged attack hit rolls, automatically pass any Cool tests.                                                                                                                                                                                 |

### Xenoculum

**80 Credits – Illegal (12)**  
_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

_A Xenoculum can represent any number of esoteric alien devices, the true purposes of which only becomes apparent through experimentation. When a player buys a Xenoculum from the Trading Post, they won’t know what it does._

They must allocate it to one of their fighters and roll a D6 on the Xenoculum table to determine its
type. If a Xenoculum is later given to a different fighter in the gang for any reason, the new fighter must pass an
Intelligence test the first time they wish to activate it. If they pass, they may use the device as normal from now
on. If they fail, they must wait until their next battle to try to activate the device again.

They immediately go into recovery and the Xenoculum is reduced to a collection of junk.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|  2  | Xenos Claws        | The Xenoculum moulds itself to the fighter’s hands, lengthening into a pair of lethal claws. The fighter’s unarmed attacks become S+2 D2 and gain the Power trait. While the fighter is equipped with the Xenoculum, any attacks they make with ranged weapons suffer a -2 to hit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|  3  | Ghost Form         | The Xenoculum is a powerful transmatter convertor, allowing its user to slip out of sequence with reality for short periods. Whenever the fighter activates, they can enter ghost form. This state persists until their next activation. While in ghost form, the fighter ignores all terrain, the effects of falling and all attacks with the exception of psychic powers. However, they cannot make attacks themselves or interact with their environment in any way. Each time the fighter enters ghost form, they must roll a D6. On a 4+, the Xenoculumhas expended its charge and cannot be used again during the battle but will recharge in time for the next battle. |
|  4  | Horror Aura        | A subliminal animalistic howl constantly screams forth from the Xenoculumand only its user is immune to its effects. Whenever the fighter activates, each other fighter, friend or foe, within 6" must make a Nerve test or become Broken.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|  5  | Alien Chem-factory | Strange mechanisms concoct alien chems within the Xenoculum, dispensing them as the fighter desires. The fighter rolls two extra Injury dice when making Recovery rolls, or assisting another Prone and Seriously Injured fighter in the Recovery phase, and chooses the dice they wish to take effect. In addition, in the post-battle sequence, one member of the fighter’s crew can make a Medical Escort action for free.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|  6  | Brain Booster      | A cranial spike allows the Xenoculum to be affixed to the fighter’s brain, greatly boosting their cognitive function. The fighter adds 5 to the dice roll when making an Intelligence test. In addition, each time the fighter would gain Experience, they gain one additional point of Experience.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

## Exclusive Personal Equipment

### Arachni-Rig Jump Boosters

**Van Saar only**  
_Source: The Aranthian Succession: Ruins of Jardlan_

Once per activation, a fighter equipped with Arachni-rig
jump boosters may choose to use them when
they perform either a Move (Simple) or a Charge
(Double) action. When they do so they add 3" to
their Movement characteristic for the duration of
the action.

When a fighter moves with the aid of Arachni-rig
jump boosters, up to half of their total movement
may be made vertically, allowing the fighter to move
between levels and even to move over impassable
terrain if they have sufficient movement to do so.
However, should the fighter’s movement end in
the air, i.e., if the fighter does not have sufficient
movement to land safely on a level surface, they will
fall the remaining distance (note that, if this distance
is 2" or less, the fighter will count as jumping down).

Should a fighter use Arachni-rig jump boosters when
making a Charge (Double) action, for the duration
of this activation they may apply both a +1 modifier
to each Hit roll they make and a +1 modifier to their
Strength characteristic.

### Ash Waste Grav-cutter

**Van Saar only, 65 Credits**  
_Source: The Aranthian Succession: Ruins of Jardlan_

:::info GRAV-CUTTERS IN THE ASH WASTES

When founding a gang for an Ash Wastes
Campaign, grav-cutters count as Wargear that
grants the Mounted condition. However,
grav-cutters may still be used in battles that do
not allow Wargear that grants the Mounted
condition (note this does not allow ash waste
grav-cutters to be used in these battles).

:::

A fighter equipped with an ash waste grav-cutter
increases their Movement characteristic by 2" and
becomes subject to the Mounted condition.

**Anti-grav Platform:** A fighter equipped with an ash
waste grav-cutter may ignore all terrain, move freely
between levels without restriction, never falls and can
move over enemy fighters, ignoring the 1" rule. They
may not, however, ignore impassable terrain and may
not end their movement with their base overlapping
an obstacle or within 1" of an enemy fighter’s base.

Additionally, a fighter equipped with an Ash Waste
Grav-cutter is not able to make the best use of cover.
To represent this, when an enemy fighter shoots at a
fighter equipped with an ash waste grav-cutter, any
negative modifiers that may apply to the hit roll due
to cover are reduced by 1.

**Hands Free:** A fighter equipped with an ash waste
grav-cutter ignores the Hands Full rule due to the
Mounted condition.

**Auto-gyro Stabilisation:** A fighter equipped with an Ash Waste Grav-cutter applies a +2 modifier to the Initiative test to avoid being pinned when hit by attempting to perform the Stand Up (Basic) action.

### Ash Cloak

**Ash Wastes Nomads only**

### Bomb Delivery Rats

**House Cawdor only**

If equipped with a grenade, spend a Basic action (Prime Bomb Rat) action:

- Make an Ammo roll as if used normally.
- Place the bomb delivery rat B2B.
- Make an Intelligence test to try to affect where the rat moves:
  - Pass: Move 6" in a chosen direction.
  - Fail: Move 6" in a random direction.

Rat movement:

- Ignores all terrain (except impassable, walls etc.).
- Suffers no penalties when climbing.
- Leaps any gap of 2” or less freely (wider gaps are considered impassable).
- Not a fighter, may move within 1” of other models.
- Can be targeted by ranged or melee attacks, but apply an additional -1 hit modifier.
- If hit, the grenade goes off on a 4+, then the rat is removed.

At the start of every subsequent round, after rolling for Priority but before activating any fighters, if the bomb delivery rat has not exploded then it will activate again.

Choose the direction and move the rat up 6” if all of the conditions apply for the fighter that deployed it is:

- Within 9”
- Active or Pinned
- Passed an Intelligence test

Otherwise, if any of the following conditions apply to the fighter, move the rat in a random direction 6”:

- Outside 9”
- Failed the Intelligence test
- Engaged
- Seriously Injured
- Out of Action

Should the rat at any time end its movement within 1” of a fighter (friend & foe), or another bomb delivery rat, roll a D6. On a 2+, the grenade will go off. On a 1, the grenade proves to be a dud and the rat vanishes into the darkness to dwell upon its good fortune. In either case, the rat is removed from play.

### Book of the Redemption

**House Cawdor only**

Can spend a Basic action (Words of Wrath). Until the End phase, all friendly Faction fighters within 6" (when activating) can use one of the following:

- Re-roll the D3 when Charging.
- Re-roll hit rolls with a result of 1 (before modifiers).

### Camoelean Elixir

**[Spire Black Market](/docs/arbitrator-tools/apocrypha-optional-rules#blood-in-the-spire)** only

_Crafted by the best Escher chymists, the camoelean elixir combines with the drinker’s epidermal layers to create an almost perfect camouflage, especially if the user remains perfectly still or is not encumbered by heavy weapons or armour._

A fighter equipped with camoelean elixir may drink it at the start of any of their activations. For the remainder
of the battle all ranged hit rolls against the fighter suffer a -2 modifier, while close combat hit rolls suffer a -1
modifier. Additionally, if the fighter is not carrying a weapon with the Unwieldy trait and has a 5+ or worse
armour save (not counting field armour), or if they did not move during their previous activation, they may only
be targeted by a ranged attack if they are within 6" of the attacker.

### Cult Icon (Corpse Grinder)

**Corpse Grinder Cult only**

Max 1 per gang. Only available to a single Leader or Champion in the gang. Can spend a Simple action (Enrage):

All friendly fighters gain +D3” movement until the End phase of this round if all the following conditions are true:

- Readied.
- Active.
- Completely within 6”

:::note

- Seems like the D3 is rolled individually for each fighter when they activate.
- Nothing prevents the fighter itself from gaining this bonus (Ready remains until the end of the activation)

:::

### Draconic Scales

**[Spire Black Market](/docs/arbitrator-tools/apocrypha-optional-rules#blood-in-the-spire)** omlu

_A rare example of conversion field technology, draconic scales incorporate dozens of tiny energy fields layered within a dermal body suit. Often worn under armour, it is proof against most weapons, negating their penetrative powers._

A fighter equipped with draconic scales cannot have their armour save modified or negated by any rule or trait.

### Grav-Cutter

**Van Saar only**  
_Source: House of Artifice_

A fighter equipped with a grav-cutter increases their Movement characteristic by 2", ignores all terrain, may
move freely between levels without restriction, can never fall, and may move over enemy fighters, ignoring
the 1" rule. They may not, however, ignore impassable terrain and may not end their movement with their
base overlapping an obstacle or within 1" of another fighter’s base.

When a fighter equipped with a grav-cutter is hit by a ranged attack, they do not become Prone and Pinned. However, a fighter equipped with a grav-cutter is unable to perform a Take Cover (Basic) action, nor can they voluntarily become Prone and Pinned for any other reason. In addition, a fighter equipped with a grav-cutter is not able to make the best use of cover. To represent this, when an enemy fighter shoots at a fighter equipped with a grav-cutter, any negative modifiers that may apply to the hit roll due to cover are reduced by 1.

Should a fighter equipped with a grav-cutter ever become Prone for any other reason (due to being Seriously Injured and then recovering, for example), they are unable to make a Stand Up (Basic) action and must instead make a Stand Up (Double) action, regardless of any other special rules or skills that may otherwise affect their ability to stand up (the Spring Up skill, for example).

#### Fly By Attacks

A fighter equipped with a grav-cutter is able to use its speed and bulk to strike down enemy fighters as they pass them by. A fighter equipped with a grav-cutter may perform the following action:

**Hit & Run (Basic):** This fighter may move a distance up to their Movement characteristic, exactly as if they were making a Move (Simple) action. If, during the course of this movement, the fighter passes over any enemy fighters, nominate one of those fighters to be the target of a single attack, representing this fighter attempting to strike them a glancing blow with the grav-cutter. Make a single hit roll by making a WS check as normal. If this check is passed, resolve a Strength 4, AP -, Damage 1 hit against the target, as if made by a weapon with both the Concussion and Knockback traits.

### Guilder Cartograph

While a gang is in possession of this map, the Badzone Environment may be altered. The first Environment can be discarded immediately and replaced by a new. If both gangs have it, roll-off to see who gets to use theirs for this battle.

In addition, the gang can deploy 4 loot caskets anywhere on the battlefield.

After each use, roll a 4+ or it is no longer valid.

### Mirror Aegis

**[Spire Black Market](/docs/arbitrator-tools/apocrypha-optional-rules#blood-in-the-spire)** only

_A mirror aegis is typical of the noble trickery common to the spire. The field projects an image of the wearer to a nearby location, drawing away enemies or getting them to turn their backs before the wearer strikes._

The first time a fighter equipped with a mirror aegis is hit by an attack (before wound rolls or armour saves are
made) roll a D6. On a 1 resolve the attack as normal, then roll again the next time the fighter is hit by an attack.
On a 2+ the attack is negated and the fighter may be placed anywhere within 6" of its current location and the
mirror aegis cannot be used again this battle.

### Proximity Auspex

**Exclusive**

A fighter equipped with a proximity auspex can take the Scan For Threats (Basic) action.

**Scan For Threats (Basic):** Select an enemy model within 24". They become Revealed until the end of the current round.

### Psychofamile Pheromone

**[Spire Black Market](/docs/arbitrator-tools/apocrypha-optional-rules#blood-in-the-spire)** only

_Perfumes, incense and aromas fill the gilded halls of the spire, many crafted to sway the emotions or minds of those who smell them. Psychofamile pheromones work to make those close to the wearer see them as a loved one – usually just before the wearer drives a knife into their chest._

When a model attempts to target a fighter equipped with psychofamile pheromones with a ranged or close
combat attack whilst they are within 3" of them (including attacks made as part of a Charge (Double) action)
they must first make a Willpower test. If the test is passed, the attack is resolved as normal. If the test is failed,
no attack is made and the action is wasted.

### Pyromantic Mantle

Melee weapons gain Blaze during this fighter's activation (not for Reaction attacks).

### Radcounter

Can never be the random target of a Badzone Event unless there are no other fighters to choose from.

### Ridge Walker

**House Cawdor only**

While equipped with a Ridge Walker, a fighter gains the Mounted condition and all of its associated rules. In addition, increase the fighter’s Movement characteristic to 9" and the fighter applies a +1 modifier to any Initiative checks they make.

### Rocket Pack

**Ash Wastes Nomads only**

The first Ammo test for a friendly charge caster within 3" is automatically passed (once per battle per rocket pack).

### Sky Mantle

**Ash Wastes Nomads only**

A fighter equipped with a sky mantle can take the Hide in the Wastes (Double) action.

**Hide in the Wastes (Double):** If this fighter is at
least 12" away from the nearest enemy model, they
gain the Hidden condition (see the Necromunda:
Core Rulebook) even if the current battle is not
using the Pitch Black rules. They become Revealed
if they move as well as all the normal triggers for
becoming Revealed.
