# Introduction

Necromunda is a sprawling, evolving game, and has had a lot of rules published since this version came out in 2017.

These rules vary across publications, and some even contradict each other. This is where the community has stepped in, and created compilations to keep the game playable.

The goal of this website is to make the rules clear and accessible, so Necromunda can reach a wider audience. It is a compilation of all content from the 2017 release onwards.

**While originally based on the Necrodamus rules compilation, with the release of the 2023 Core Rules, this website is using verbatim (RAW) rules instead.** This covers the 2023 Core Rules and many of the previous publications. A status of what has been transcribed in long-form can be [viewed here](/docs/rules-revision/).

All original content is owned by Games Workshop and published here without permission. When you buy a gang, please buy their House/Book as well! Necromunda is all about the narrative, and each book features fantastic backstories and fluff that elevate the title far beyond the core game mechanics.

Throughout these page you may see box-outs. Here are some examples that you will see that are not from the original rules:

Through these pages you will see House Rules. These are optional, but are suggested to provide a more enjoyable and seamless gaming experience.
