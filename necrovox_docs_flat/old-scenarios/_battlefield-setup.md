# Battlefield Setup & Deployment

Some scenarios have special instructions. This is the default method:

## Battlefield Setup

### Sector Mechanicus & Ash Wastes Battlefield Setup

Sector Mechanicus should generally a lot of terrain. Ash Wastes uses less terrain and more open/flat areas.

Recommended size:

- 4'x4'.

Set up the battlefield pieces in the following order:

1. Large terrain pieces.
1. Obstacles.
1. 2 Loot caskets.

Take turns setting up pieces. The defender starts (or the winner of a roll-off if there is no defender) in each step. The only exception is loot caskets, where the winner of a roll-off starts. At any point in each step, anyone can declare they are finished setting up pieces. The opponent can then set up one last piece before moving on to the next step.

Finally, if the scenario does not give special instructions for loot caskets, everyone, starting with the winner of a roll-off, places one anywhere on the battlefield that is not within 6” of an edge of the battlefield.

### Zone Mortalis Battlefield Setup

Zone Mortalis should generally have a lot of terrain, tight corridors with a few open areas.

Recommended size (using 12" tiles):

- 3'x3 or 3'x4'.

Set up the battlefield pieces in the following order:

1. Tiles (maximum number described by scenario) and some walls.
1. Minimum 3 Doors (with optional terminals).
1. D6 Barricades.
1. 2 Ductways (optional).
1. 2 Loot caskets.

:::danger House Rule
Setup D3+3 Barricades instead.
:::

Take turns setting up pieces. The defender starts (or the winner of a roll-off if there is no defender) in each step. The only exception is loot caskets, where the winner of a roll-off starts.

Each tile must be placed with minimum half of its edges touching an existing tile.

Everyone can place any number of doors and terminal. As long as 3 doors have been placed, anyone can declare they are finished. The opponent can then set up one last door.

Place D6 barricades (max 3 each).

Place 1 ductway per player.

Finally, if the scenario does not give special instructions for loot caskets, each player, starting with the winner of a roll-off, places 1 anywhere on the battlefield that is not within 6” of an edge of the battlefield.

## Deployment

### Sector Mechanicus & Ash Wastes Deployment

Draw a line dividing the battlefield into 2 equal halves. Starting with the defender (or the winner of a roll-off if there is no defender):

- Select one half of the battlefield.
- Set up the entire starting crew.
- All models must be set up at least 12” away from the dividing line.

### Zone Mortalis Deployment

Starting with the defender (or the winner of a roll-off if there is no defender):

- Choose a deployment area:
  - 1 full tile.
  - 3” area from one edge of the battlefield.
- Set up the entire starting crew.

The attacker (or the loser of a roll-off if there is no attacker):

- Choose a deployment area
  - 1 full tile that is at least 1 full tile away from the enemy deployment zone.
  - 2” area from the opposite edge.
- Set up the entire starting crew.

A fighter can never be deployed (during deployment or as reinforcement) in an area of the battlefield which is entirely blocked off by walls. Unless there is a ductway placed allowing fighters into and out of such areas, no fighters may ever be deployed in blocked-off corners.
