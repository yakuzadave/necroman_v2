:::

_As dangerous as the depths of the underhive can be, any hiver will tell you they are preferable to braving the wastes. Forgetting for a moment that there is no ceiling out there, it is an environment that can change as swiftly as the direction of the wind; one minute, yellow rolling skies promising safe(ish) travel, and the next, ash storms strong enough to hurl a dune crawler a hundred metres into the air. To live, fight and die in the wastes means doing so under a blanket of ever- changing ashen clouds and on ground that could open up and swallow you at any moment. Nonetheless, the wastes still draw countless gangs and guilders with the promise of wealth and lost tech._

_Fighting in the ash wastes is a very different experience to battling it out in the confines of a hive city. To represent this unique environment, players are encouraged to use the special battlefield conditions presented here, as they reflect the true perils of the wastes, and will offer gangs and fighters a new set of challenges. Two factors determine what kind of battlefield rules will be in effect during an Ash Wastes battle: **Region** and **Season**._

_Region is the type of Battlefield Surface on which the fight is taking place and includes the Near Wastes, Deep Wastes and Wild Wastes._

_Season represents the atmospheric conditions in effect and includes the Season of Flame, Season of Ash and Changing Seasons._

## Battlefield Conditions

After choosing a scenario, during the pre-battle sequence, players that decide their battle is taking place in the ash wastes should determine Region and Season. There are three ways this can be done depending on the kind of battle being played.

- The campaign or scenario can specify certain Season and/or Region.
- Randomize by rolling on the Region and Season tables.
- Gangs can agree to choose specific effects to use. If players want a more reliable outcomes they can either choose Region and Season and their effects or roll to determine Region and Season, then count the specific affect as if rolling a 6-8.

## Battlefield Surface

The battlefield surface is the ground level of the battlefield. Any changes to the surface do not apply to:

- Terrain.
- Elevated areas.
- Roads.

## Roads

Roads are a special kind of battlefield terrain that
can be represented either by placing actual terrain on
the battlefield or marking out part of the Battlefield
Surface as counting as a road. These pieces of terrain
are important to the commerce and livelihood of the
ash wastes and players are encouraged to include
at least one road on their battlefield, unless it is
taking place in the heart of a settlement or out in the
Deep Wastes. Typically, a road will be 6"-8" wide and
run from one battlefield edge to the other. Unless
otherwise noted, any rules that apply to the Battlefield
Surface do not apply to roads, as they have been
specifically constructed to allow safe passage across
otherwise dangerous terrain.

Recommendations:

- 1+ roads, 6"-8" wide, running from one battlefield edge to another.

## Visibility (X")

_In the changeable conditions of the ash wastes, visibility is not always as good as in the underhive, protected as it is from the outside elements._

- Models cannot be targeted outside X" (includes charges).
- All weapons use Long Range accuracy (regardless of actual distance).
- Affects where terrain can be placed when coming into view (Rolling Roads).
- Any effect that ignores or modifies Pitch Black also affects Visibility.

There are two ways to determine the Regions and Season: a simplified - and more predictable - version, from Book of the Outlands, and a more advanced - and lethal - version from the Ash Wastes rulebook. To use the simplified version, simply roll a D3 on the simplified tables, and for the advanced, roll a D3 and then 2D6 on the advanced tables.

Players and Arbitrators should feel free to use whichever set of rules they prefer.

## Regions

_The ash wastes cover vast areas of Necromunda and fill the empty wilds between the towering hive cities. Only the ignorant or those who have never seen them believe the wastes are uniform across all of Necromunda. In reality there is a huge variety of wasteland environs ranging from rolling ashen dunes, burning salt flats and bubbling tox rivers to diamondhard ironflats, glittering scrap-seas and refuse-laden mountain ranges. While there are hundreds of classifications and names for these different areas, most Necromundans group them into three broad categories: the Near Wastes, the Deep Wastes and the Wild Wastes._

Regions affect the battlefield surface which in turn will affect fighters on the battlefield surface.

The resource at stake will determine the Region, otherwise randomize (D3):

1. Near Wastes.
1. Deep Wastes.
1. Wild Wastes.

| 1   | Near Wastes | **Open Ground:** The Battlefield Surface is mostly hardpan and counts as open terrain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 2   | Deep Wastes | **Rolling Ash:** The Battlefield Surface is baked ash flats and counts as open terrain. In addition, models that move more than 6" upon the Battlefield Surface during their activation count as having partial cover until their next activation as they kick up great clouds of dust and ash. If using the Sentries rules, this will also Raise the Alarm. |
| 3   | Wild Wastes | **Shifting Dunes:** The Battlefield Surface is deep dunes of toxic dust and ash, and counts as difficult terrain. In addition, models that do not move during their activation suffer a Wound or lose a Hull Point as they begin to sink!                                                                                                                    |

## Seasons

_On Necromunda, the atmosphere is forever in turmoil. It is a world held on the brink of complete and utter environmental collapse, its biosphere long having been destroyed. Once, millennia ago, the world had Ancient Terra-like seasons, ranging from warm and kind summers, to brisk, snow-laden winters. Now there are only two major seasons on Necromunda: the Season of Flame and the Season of Ash – both of which are brutal and extremely hazardous to life. Caught between these two great seasons are numerous lesser seasons that occur sporadically, each bringing with it a new myriad of dangers for travellers and little respite from the hell of the ash wastes._

The season depends on the phase & cycle of your campaign, otherwise randomize with a D3.

### 1. Season of Flame.

_As Necromunda tilts toward its star, and the solar rays bombard the planet in greater frequency, the Season of Flame begins. During this great cycle, the temperature of the planet soars and chemical changes occur across its wastelands. Some areas catch fire, while others harden into gleaming diamond oceans that can cut a vehicle to scrap in seconds. The greatest danger from the Season of Flame comes from the heat, and travellers without adequate protection can burn alive if outside for too long._

#### 2. Season of Ash.

_When the planet tilts away from its star, the temperatures drop as swiftly as they rise and, as they fall, massive storms boil up in their wake. During the Season of Ash, the deadly winds of Necromunda blow ceaselessly across the world, some storms growing large enough to engulf entire continents. Travel becomes more perilous as visibility drops to almost nil in most places and both landmarks and roads vanish under mountains of ash. It is, however, also a time for scavenging, as what past storms have hidden, new storms may uncover._

#### 3. Changing Seasons.

_Time between the great seasons can be fleeting, and those who live in the ash wastes quickly learn not to trust the so-called lesser seasons that fill these spaces. During the changing of the seasons, a variety of strange and equally deadly weather might descend on a region, settlement or hive. These can range from rust storms filling the air with the fragmented remains of hive cities, billowing clouds of radioactive dust released from the high atmosphere or even perpetual night as the skies thicken with ash._

| 1   | Flame    | **Soaring Temperatures:** Shimmering curtains of heat mean the Visibility (24") rule is in effect.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 2   | Ash      | **Ash Clouds:** Thick ash clouds press down upon the battlefield, meaning the Visibility (12") rule is in effect.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 3   | Changing | **Wild Weather:** The weather is wild and unpredictable, with dust clouds rolling in with no warning. The Visibility (X") rule is in effect; to determine the value of X, at the start of each round before rolling for Initiative, roll a D3 and multiply the result by 6 (giving a result of either 6, 12 or 18"). |

## Rolling Roads

_Often, battles between gangs in the ash wastes are not static affairs. Bikes, trucks and other vehicles careening across a desolate landscape, all the while trying to kill each other, is one of the most evocative images of the ash wastes. These encounters are represented with a set of rules called Rolling Roads._

Used in some scenarios, works best on larger battlefields.

- Size: 6'x4' (recommended size) unless specified in the scenario.

#### Direction

- One edge will be Leading, the opposite will be Trailing. The other 2 edges are sides.
- The direction of travel is always from Trailing towards Leading.
- The scenario will specify the direction, otherwise randomize 2 opposite short edges as Leading & Trailing.

#### Sides

_Roads across the ash wastes take many different forms, form deep valleys, to wide open ash flats, to precarious bridges going over deep crevasses._

Battlefield sides can have the following special rules:

- **Impassable Sides:** Models cannot voluntarily move off the sides. If a vehicle is forced to hit the sides, resolve it as if it were a [collision against impassable terrain](/docs/rules/movement#colliding-with-terrain).
- **Cliff Sides:** Models moving off the sides are immediately taken Out of Action (suffering a Lasting Injury/Damage roll as normal).
- **Open Sides:** Models moving off the sides are Left Behind (can Rejoin later).

#### Clouds of Ash

As they race through the landscape, vehicles and fighters kick up huge clouds of obscuring ash.

If a model moves further than its Movement characteristic during its activation, all shooting attacks against it suffer a -1 modifiers until it is activated again.

#### Rolling Road Phase

At the start of each End phase, the Rolling Road phase happens. Resolve the following steps:

1. **Move the Battlefield:** All models and terrain are moved 8" directly towards the Trailing Edge. Anything contacting the Trailing Edge is removed.
2. **Left Behind:** Models not completely within the battlefield are Left Behind.
   - Seriously Injured: Succumb to injuries (roll a 3+ or suffer a Lasting Injury).
   - Stationary/Stalled: Can rejoin after this round (not this round), becoming Mobile.
   - Counts as Out of Action for the purposes of Bottle tests (until rejoining).
3. **Rejoin:** Left Behind models with a Move characteristic of at least 7" can pass an Intelligence check to rejoin as Reinforcements (this round). <br />If failed, try again in the next End phase.
   - Reinforcements (unless otherwise specified):
     - All available Reinforcements arrive each round within 3" of the Trailing Edge.
     - All markers still apply (Out of Ammo, Wounds, Flesh Wounds, damage etc.), except Stationary vehicles (automatically become Mobile).
4. **Add New Terrain/Obstacles:** Battle continues down the road and more of the road ahead comes into view.<br />Alternate placing terrain pieces (starting with the gang without Priority), using D3-1 pieces of available & suitable terrain (note that the result can be zero):
   - Any available and suitable terrain piece can be placed.
   - If no Visibility limit, terrain must be placed touching the Leading Edge.
   - Visibility (X"): Anywhere at least X" closer to the Leading Edge than any model.
   - At least 3" from any model or terrain.
   - If terrain can't be placed according to these guidelines, then skip placing that terrain.
