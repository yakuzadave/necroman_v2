# Scenario Special Rules

:::info
You are viewing the archived rules from before the 2023 Core books. Use the menu to navigate to the current rules.
:::

Some scenarios are subject to additional special rules.

## Sneak Attacks

In some scenarios, the defender may not initially be aware of the attacker’s presence. In these scenarios, the following rules are used. The defender's starting crew will always be 5 fighters (custom or random as specified in each scenario).

### Sentries

- Never becomes Ready at the start of a round (before the alarm is raised).
- The defender always activates a random sentry. Note that a sentry can be activated several times in the same turn in this way.
- Once the last attacking fighter has activated, one more sentry is activated, then the Activation phase ends.
- When a sentry is activated, roll-off to see who makes a Move (Basic) action for the sentry:
  - If the attacker rolled the highest, the attacker can move the sentry.
  - Otherwise the defender can move the sentry.
- The player who moved the sentry chooses a facing.
- Open or close any door within 1” before or after moving.

### Spotting Attackers

After the move, roll 2D6. If any attackers are within that many inches of any sentry, and within their vision arc, they may be spotted. Roll a D6, subtracting 1 from the result if the attacker is Prone:

- 2+ if within 3” (regardless of facing).
- 2+ if in the open (regardless of facing).
- 4+ if in partial cover and more than 3” away.
- 6+ if in full cover and more than 3” away.
- Pitch Black: Counts as full cover (6+) if more than 3" away.

A sentry will automatically spot the attacking fighter when:

- Engaged
- Pinned (ranged attack)

### Alerted Sentries

If a sentry spots any attacker:

- Becomes Ready.
- No longer part of the sentry group.
- Can make Retaliation attacks (if Engaged).
- If not Engaged, pass an Initiative test to immediately make a ranged attack against the spotted enemy fighter.

### Raising the Alarm

The alarm is raised if:

- At least 1 sentry is Ready when any sentry is activated.
- If an attacker fires a weapon, roll 2D6 and add the weapon’s Strength after the attack has been resolved. If the weapon has the Blast trait, add 2 to the result. If the result is 10+, the alarm is raised.
- From the 5th round onwards, if the attacker rolls 1 or 2 for the Priority, the alarm is raised.

Once the alarm is raised:

- The Sentry Round ends.
- Resolve the End phase.
- Continue the battle as normal (sentry rules are no longer used).

## Reinforcements

These are the default rules for when and how Reinforcements arrive (unless otherwise specified):

- Arrive at the end of the End phase.
- Randomize which fighters arrive.
- Roll a D6:
  - 1-2: The opponent deploys them.
  - 3+: The controlling player deploys them.

The scenario will always specify the following:

- If Reinforcements are used.
- How many fighters are part of the Reinforcements.
- How many arrive each round.
- Which round they arrive.

**Bottle Tests:** Reinforcements do not count as models in the crew when making Bottle tests (only starting crew is counted).

**N17:** Tactics cards that equip a model with a piece of wargear from the start of the battle (for example a frag trap) must usually be played during deployment, however they can instead be played when a model arrives as Reinforcements.

:::danger House Rules

#### Reinforcements

Include Reinforcements when making Bottle tests.

Some scenarios could reward one gang with 10 custom fighters and the other gang random 4 (min) + reinforcements. The small gang would bottle 50% after first Seriously Injured or OoA. The big gang would bottle on 17% after suffering 5 casualties! This will cause massive imbalance.

:::

## Home Turf Advantage

While a gang defends on its own turf, gain the following:
Defender:

- Bottle tests: Roll 2D6 and discard the highest.
- Rally tests: +1.
- Hangers-on: Roll a D6 (individually).
  - 1-3: The hanger-on is unfortunate enough to be around when the fighting starts, and must be included as part of the crew.
  - 4-6: The hangers-on escapes before the battle and is not part of the crew.

## Pitch Black

All fighters are Hidden unless having the following:

- Ablaze.
- [Refractor field](/docs/armoury/field-armour#refractor-field).
- Photo-lumens.
- Holochromatic Field (while operational).
- Rad-phaged (Tech skill).

Fighters are Revealed (no longer Hidden) in the following situations:

- Ablaze.
- Refractor field: Always.
- Photo-lumens: Always.
- Holochromatic Field: While operational.
- Rad-phaged: Always.
- Ranged weapon: When used (except Silent).
- Power weapon: When used.
- Irradiated Coolant (Toxic Downpour): While in effect.
- Vehicles: When moving.

Ranged attacks and Charges can only be made against targets that meet at least one of the following criterias:

- Revealed.
- Within 3”.
- Within 12” with infra-scope, [photo-goggles](/docs/armoury/personal-equipment#photo-goggles) or photo-lumens.
- Within 4" of a Rally Point (Assault On Precinct 17).
- Within any range with "And Lo His Gaze did Illuminate them!" (Cawdor Path of the Faithful).

In each End phase, Revealed fighters become Hidden (no longer Revealed), unless being affected by any of the exceptions above.

:::info N21 PITCH BLACK (IMPROVED VERSION)
Charge is not affected by Pitch Black.
:::

:::note ASH WASTES NOTES
Should probably use some common sense to restrict several special rules that can enable/disable Pitch Black, as most of these were designed for battles inside the hive, not out in the open wastes.
:::

## Ammo Cache

Apply the following effects within 1”:

- +2 modifier for Ammo tests.
- Ignore the Scarce trait.
- If the Ammo roll is a 6 (before modifiers), the ammo cache is has no further effect (exhausted).

## Booby Trap

A fighter risks triggering a boby trap in the following situations (but only once per booby trap in a single activation):

- Comes within 2” of a booby trap (for any reason)
- Ends an action within 2".

Roll a D6:

- **1:** A dud, remove it from play.
- **2-3:** Not triggered, leave it in place.
- **4+:** Triggered and explodes.

#### Exploding While Moving

If triggered during movement, the move is interrupted while resolving the booby trap (resolved where the fighter was while moving). If Pinned or Injured, the move action ends.

#### Shooting at Booby Trabs

Can be targeted with ranged attacks:

- Short range: -1 to hit.
- Long Range: -2 to hit.

If hit, roll a D6:

- **1-2:** No effect.
- **3-4:** Triggered and explodes.
- **5-6:** Disarmed and removed.

:::info N21 (HIVE WAR) BOOBY TRAPS
These are alternative rules for triggering traps:

#### Melta

Replace the trap with a pitfall marker (centered on the trap). Any fighter partially or completely covered by the marker:

- Completely: Out of Action.
- Partially: Make an Initiative test.
  - Success: Pinned and moved as short as possible outside the marker.
  - Fail: Out of Action.

The pitfall remains in play.

#### Gas

2D6" range (instead of 5" blast).

:::

## Treasure Casket

#### Forgotten Ordance, Hive Ruins Terrain

Counts as a Loot Casket, with different contents. If opened, roll a D6:

| D6       | Result                                                                                                               |
| -------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1:**   | **Click!:** Fitted with a fiendishly clever needle-trap. Roll an Injury dice and apply the result (no save possible) |
| **2-3:** | **Fancy Threads:** The fighter immediately gains Uphive Raiments Status item.                                        |
| **4-6:** | **A Noble’s Ransom:** The fighter immediately gains a Personal Equipment item, chosen by the controlling player.     |

## Gang Relics

+2 to any Cool and Leadership tests made by friendly fighters within 6”.

## The Beast's Lair

If any model ends an activation within 6”, roll a D6. The beast will attack if at least one condition is met:

- The result is a 6.
- The result is higher than the number of inches between the fighter and the Beast’s Lair.

The Beast’s Lair is not a model. It is always considered to be Standing and can never become Prone or be moved by any means. Models can move within 1” of the Beast’s Lair and may move into base contact with it without needing to perform a Charge (Double) action. Models can attack the Beast’s Lair with ranged or close combat attacks. If reduced to 0 Wounds, remove it from play.

:::

## Defence Servitor

- Immobile (can't move).
- 360° vision arc
- Counts any Injury roll as Flesh Wound (can only be taken Out of Action by being reduced to T0).
- Can't be Pinned.
- Automatically passes any Cool tests.

| M   | WS  | BS  | S   | T   | W   | I   | A   | Ld  | Cl  | Wil | Int |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| -   | 5+  | 4+  | 5   | 5   | 1   | 3+  | 2   | 7+  | 5+  | 9+  | 8+  |

Weapons: [Grav gun](/docs/armoury/special-weapons#grav-gun), [Servo Claw](/docs/armoury/close-combat#servo-claw)<br />
Wargear: [Light carapace (4+)](/docs/armoury/armour#carapace)

#### Overwatch Routine

The servitor will make Shoot (Basic) actions whenever all of the following are true:

- Not Engaged.
- A fighter ends an activation within LOS of the servitor.
- Passes an Initiative test. This test is automatically passed if at least one of the following is true:
  - The first time each round.
  - The activated fighter made an attack against the servitor.

If Engaged, make Reaction attacks as normal.

## Hive Dwellers

HIVE DWELLERS
Treated as fighters and use the normal rules for movement, stray shots, being Engaged and pinning. However, if reduced to 0 wounds, they are taken Out of Action without rolling any Injury dice.

| M   | WS  | BS  | S   | T   | W   | I   | A   | Ld  | Cl  | Wil | Int |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 5"  | 5+  | 5+  | 3   | 3   | 1   | 4+  | 1   | 7+  | 8+  | 9+  | 9+  |

Hivers do not activate normally and instead react to the actions of nearby fighters. Hivers are triggered by the following actions:

- A fighter makes a Shoot action within 12”
- A fighter makes a Fight action within 6”
- A blast is placed (after scatter) within 6”
- A fighter or hiver is hit by a ranged attack within 6”

After working out the effects of the action that triggered the hiver, roll a D6 on the table that follows (roll separately for each hiver that is triggered).

| D6      | Result                                                                                                                                          |
| ------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1-2** | **Damn Gangers messing up my Town!** Take a single Shoot action using a stub gun at the nearest fighter (even if they didn’t trigger the local) |
| **3-4** | **OK, take it Easy Fella:** Take no action                                                                                                      |
| **5-6** | **I’m getting outta here!** Become Broken (may rally in the End phase as normal by passing a Cool test)                                         |

During the End phase, take turns moving the hivers. Roll the Scatter dice for each one - on a Hit, the player moves the hiver its full Move in a direction of their choice, otherwise they make a full Move in the direction indicated (stopping if it contacts terrain).

## Corrupt Enforcer

- Counts as a normal fighter.
- Can't take part in a Group Activation.

Weapons: [Enforcer boltgun](/docs/armoury/basic-weapons#boltgun), [Shock Stave](/docs/armoury/close-combat#shock-stave).<br />
Wargear: [Hardened Flak](/docs/armoury/armour#flak), [Armoured Undersuit](/docs/armoury/personal-equipment#armoured-undersuit).

## Multi-player games

Many scenarios can be used with more than two gangs. They can be modified depending on the difference in Gang Rating:

- Stronger gangs can deploy in the most exposed area.
- Stronger gangs can deploy further away from the objective.
- Stronger gangs can have random crew while weaker gangs can have custom crew.

Multi-player games use all the normal rules for battles with the following clarifications:

#### Priority

Roll for Priority as normal, taking turns activating the fighters. Re-roll ties.

#### Melee Combat

Count interference from all fighters B2B, even if they are from different gangs. However, fighters can only claim assistance from models from their own gang.

#### Defenders and Attackers

In scenarios that have defenders and attackers, divide the gangs roughly equal on both sides.

## Loot Caskets

There will always be at least 2 loot caskets on any battlefield. The content is unknown until opened. Active fighters within 1” of a loot casket may perform actions to open or carry a loot casket.

:::info SMASH OPEN (BASIC)
Requires the fighter to be within 1”. Roll a D6 and add the fighter’s Strength. On a 6+, the casket is opened; however, subtract 1 from the result when rolling to determine the casket’s contents (minimum 1).
:::

:::info BYPASS LOCK (BASIC)
Requires the fighter to be within 1”. Pass an Intelligence test to open the casket.
:::

:::info CARRY (SIMPLE)
Requires the fighter to be within 1”. Make a Move (Simple) action, carrying the loot casket or ammo cache with them. When the action ends, the casket is placed in base contact with this fighter.
:::

#### Opening Loot Caskets

If opened, roll a D6

| D6       | Result                                                                         |
| -------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1:**   | **Dangerous Goods:** The casket is booby trapped. Replace it with a Frag trap. |
| **2-3:** | **Nothing Useful:** Receive D6 credits.                                        |
| **4-6:** | **Ammo Cache:** Replace it with an Ammo Cache.                                 |

## Rolling Roads (Ash Wastes)

ROLLING ROADS (ASH WASTES)
Used in some scenarios, works best on larger battlefields.

- Size: 6'x4' (recommended size) unless specified in the scenario.

#### Direction

- One edge will be Leading, the opposite will be Trailing. The other 2 edges are sides.
- The direction of travel is always from Trailing towards Leading.
- The scenario will specify the direction, otherwise randomize 2 opposite short edges as Leading & Trailing.

#### Sides

Battlefield sides can have the following special rules:

- **Impassable:** Models cannot voluntarily move off the sides. Treated as impassable terrain when hit by vehicles (collision).
- **Cliff:** Models moving off the sides are immediately taken Out of Action (suffering a Lasting Injury/Damage roll as normal).
- **Open Sides:** Models moving off the sides are Left Behind (can Rejoin later).

#### Clouds of Ash

Shooting attacks suffer a -1 hit modifier if targeting models that moved further than its Move stat during its previous activation.

#### Rolling Road Phase

At the start of each End phase, resolve the following steps:

1. **Move the Battlefield:** All models and terrain are moved 8" directly towards the Trailing Edge. Anything contacting the Trailing Edge is removed.
2. **Left Behind:** Models not completely within the battlefield are Left Behind.
   - Seriously Injured: Succumb to injuries (roll a 3+ or suffer a Lasting Injury).
   - Stationary: Can rejoin after this round (not this round), becoming Mobile.
   - Counts as Out of Action for the purposes of Bottle tests (until rejoining).
3. **Rejoin:** Left Behind models with Move 7"+ can pass an Intelligence check to rejoin as Reinforcements (this round). <br />If failed, try again in the next End phase.
   - Reinforcements (unless otherwise specified):
     - All available Reinforcements arrive each round within 3" of the Trailing Edge.
     - All markers still apply (Out of Ammo, Wounds, Flesh Wounds, damage etc.), except Stationary vehicles (automatically become Mobile).
4. **Add New Terrain/Obstacles:** Battle continues down the road and more of the road ahead comes into view.<br />Alternate placing terrain pieces (starting with the gang without Priority), using D3-1 pieces of available & suitable terrain (note that the result can be zero):
   - Touching the Leading Edge.
   - At least 3" from any model or terrain.
   - Visibility (X"): Anywhere at least X" closer to the Leading Edge than any model.
   - If terrain can't be placed according to these guidelines, then skip placing that terrain.
