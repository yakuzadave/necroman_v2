# Joining A Genestealer Cult

The threat of the Genestealer is an insidious one, attacking humanity at the genetic level. Throughout
the Imperium, unseen strains of the xenos curse
thrive in the dark places of worlds, amongst disparate
populations and in the fringes of society. Necromunda
is no exception, and even the foot soldiers of the Clan
Houses are not immune to the spreading taint of the
Broodlord of Hive Secundus.

The following section provides guidelines for creating
a Genestealer Infected gang or running a gang that
has become infected and joined a wider Genestealer
Cult during a campaign. Any of the six House gangs – Orlock, Delaque, Escher, Cawdor, Goliath and Van
Saar – can be infected by a Genestealer Cult if their
player chooses.

## Lure Of The Patriarch

Infecting a gang with the Genestealer’s curse can be
done in one of two ways: either the gang can begin
enthralled by a Genestealer Cult or they can join one
during a campaign.

- During gang creation a player can decide if their
  gang carries the Genestealer taint. If they do they
  gain the benefits detailed that follow, but are also
  automatically an Outlaw gang (see page 6).
- During a campaign, a player can attempt to embrace
  their Genestealer masters’ ways by having their
  gang submit to a Genestealer Cult after any game. When they do this, the gang automatically becomes
  an Outlaw gang as word of their deviancy spreads. Then, in the post-battle sequence their Leader can
  seek out a cult by making an Intelligence check. If
  successful they have found a cult and can join it. If
  they fail, they can try again after their next game.

Alternatively, if there is a player in the campaign who
is already running a Genestealer Cults gang, or a
gang corrupted by a Genestealer Cult, and they agree, the prospective cult gang can join the cult without the
need to pass an Intelligence check.

## Benefits Of The Brood

A Genestealer Infected gang gains the
following benefits:

- The gang Leader may be upgraded to a Psyker.
- The ability to hire 0-1 Aberrants.
- Access to a Cult Icon.
- The ability to hire Hybrid Juves.

Note that with the exceptions detailed previously, Clan
House gangs retain access to their House Weapon
lists and use the skill lists applicable to their gang. As an Outlaw gang (see page 6), the Genestealer
Infected gang has restricted access to the Trading
Post and cannot purchase House specific Exotic
Beasts or Brutes, though may visit the Black Market
without restriction.

### Designer’s Note: The Secundus Look…

Genestealer Infected gangs provide a wealth of
modelling opportunities for players. Bald-headed
Orlocks in purple leathers, Goliaths with extra
alien arms and chitinous plating for armour or
Cawdor gangers carrying cult icons into battle
alongside hulking Aberrants are just some of the
options available to players.

While there are no game requirements to
model a Genestealer Infected gang as different
from their more wholesome counterparts, it
is certainly encouraged! Players will find that
many components in the Warhammer 40,000
Genestealer Cult range are cross-compatible
with the Necromunda gangs with little or no
modelling work. Also, in a campaign the Arbitrator
might require Genestealer Infected gangs
to be distinctive from their non-Genestealer
counterparts, so that their opponents know what
kind of gang they are facing.

### Upgrading The Leader To A Psyker

The Leader of a Genestealer Infected gang can be
upgraded to become a Psyker for a cost of 40 credits. This cost is paid during the post-battle sequence and
requires the Leader to forgo any Post-battle Actions, such as Trade or Seek Rare Equipment, and to not
be In Recovery. Once the Leader has been upgraded,
they gain the Non-sanctioned Psyker rule (see page
77 of the Necromunda Rulebook) and can choose
a single power from the Genestealer Cults Wyrd
Power list on page 48. Thereafter, they count Cult
Wyrd Powers as one of the Primary Skill lists. Psychic
Leaders also have access to Psychic Familiars (see
page 47) and may hire them by following the rules for
Exotic Beasts.

### Hiring An Aberrant

Genestealer Infected gangs can include a single
Aberrant in their gang. This fighter is recruited and
equipped just as if it was part of a Genestealer Cults
gang (see page 44) and counts against the limit of
Leaders, Champions and Juves that can be included
in the gang.

### Adding A Cult Icon

Genestealer Infected gangs can include a single Cult
Icon for 40 credits. This Cult Icon must be carried by
the Leader or a Champion and follows the rules found
on page 135 of Necromunda: Gangs of the Underhive.

### Hiring Hybrid Juves

When a Genestealer Infected gang recruits a Juve
(either as part of gang creation, during the post- battle sequence or as a result of a territory such as a
Settlement), they can instead recruit a Hybrid Juve. Hybrid Juves represent the first generations of the
budding cult. They have the same profile and weapon
restrictions as a normal Juve but come with a Extra
Arm (see page 43) and cost 30 credits more (unless
they are gained for free such as from a Settlement)
