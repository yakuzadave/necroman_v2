# Chaos Special Rules

## Dark Rituals: Lead Ritual

The following gangs can seek the favour of certain Chaos Gods.

- **Corpse Grinder Cult:** Khorne.
- **Chaos Cult:** Any Chaos God (can change between battles).
- **Corrupted gang:** Any Chaos God (can't change after the first).

:::danger House Rule (Necrodamus)

Corpse Grinder Cult is given access to Dark Rituals here for fluff reasons.

:::

1. The Leader can make a Lead Ritual as a post-battle action (once per post-battle sequence).
2. Decide which of the Chaos Gods the ritual is invoking: Khorne, Nurgle, Slaanesh or Tzeentch.
3. A random fighter (not Leader or Witch) can be the focus of the ritual, offering them up to be a vessel of the gods’ power.  
   Alternatively, a Captive (that could normally be sold if held by a non-Chaos gang) can be sacrificed to fuel the ritual.
4. Then roll 2D6 and apply the following modifiers:
   - +2 if praising a Chaos gods the cult already has the favour of.
   - +2 if sacrificing a Captive.
   - +1 if winning this battle.
   - +1 if gaining Reputation this battle.
   - -1 if losing Reputation this battle.
   - -1 if losing this battle.
   - -2 if praising a different Chaos god than the cult has the favour of.

**Success (+9 after modifiers):** The gang is heeded by the cult’s patron. Any existing favour is replaced. If a fighter was the focus of the ritual, that fighter gains D6 XP.

**Failure (2 or less before or after modifiers):** The cult is deemed unworthy. Lose any existing favour. If a fighter was picked to be the focus of the ritual, that fighter is turned into a [Chaos Spawn](/docs/gangs/gang-lists/helot-chaos-cult#chaos-spawn) (effectively slain and any equipment is lost). The Spawn is added for free, but the cost affects Gang Rating.
