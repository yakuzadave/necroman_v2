**Skills:** 1 Primary (custom).

**Special Rules:** Gang Leader, Gang Hierarchy (Leader), Tools of the Trade, Group Activation (2).

<details className="">
<summary>Special Rules</summary>

**Gang Leader:** A House Van Saar gang must always include a single fighter with this special rule:

- A fighter with this special rule may not retire during Campaign play. For a gang leader, the only way out is death.
- Should this fighter die during the course of a campaign, or otherwise be removed from the gang (for example, if a captured Leader is Sold to the Guilders), another fighter must be promoted to replace them (see [Death of a Leader](/docs/founding-a-gang/gang-creation#death-of-a-leader)).

**Gang Hierarchy (Leader):** During a battle, once this fighter’s gang has failed a Bottle test, during any End phase in which this fighter passes its Cool check and does not flee the battlefield, any friendly Van Saar fighters that are within 12" of this fighter will automatically pass their Cool check and will not flee the battlefield. Additionally, during Campaign play this fighter may perform post-battle actions.

**Tools of the Trade:** This fighter enjoys access to a wide variety of weapons. A fighter
with this special rule may take multiple equipment sets.

**Group Activation (2):** When a fighter with this special rule is activated, their
controlling player can choose to activate a number of additional Ready friendly Van
Saar fighters equal to the number shown in brackets that are within 3" of this fighter
as part of a ‘Group Activation’:

- The controlling player must nominate all of the fighters who will be activated in this
  way before any of them is activated.
- Once all participants of the Group Activation have been nominated, the controlling
  player selects one and activates them as normal, fully resolving their activation
  before selecting and activating the next. Each fighter activates individually; groups
  do not activate simultaneously.
  Additional fighters with this special rule activated in this way may not themselves use
  this special rule during this activation.
  Skills: When recruited, a Van Saar Prime may choose one skill from their Primary
  skill sets (as described in the Necromunda Rulebook). This skill does not cost any XP
  and does not increase the fighter’s credits value.

_Primes are the masters of the Van Saar clan gangs. In the war for supremacy among the Clan Houses, they are the captains and commanders of the foot soldiers, leading their troops into battle against the unenlightened, the barbarian or those who would see the STC harmed in any way. Each one is a master of technology, especially that created by the clan Archeoteks, and brings a truly terrifying array of weapons with them when they enter battle in the name of their masters._
