**Wargear:** [Armoured bodyglove](/docs/armoury/armour#armoured-bodyglove) and [Grav-cutter](/docs/armoury/personal-equipment#grav-cutter).  
**Special Rules:** Gang Fighter (Prospect), Tools of the Trade, Promotion (Van Saar Augmek or Van Saar Archeotek), Hot-headed, Fast Learner.

<details className="">
<summary>Special Rules</summary>

**Tools of the Trade:** This fighter enjoys access to a wide variety of weapons.
A fighter with this special rule may take multiple equipment sets.

**Gang Fighter (Prospect):** Fighters with this special rule form the backbone of House
Van Saar gangs. The total number of fighters with the Gang Fighter (X) special rule
in the gang must always be equal to, or higher than, the total number of fighters
without the Gang Fighter (X) special rule combined, not counting Hangers-on or
Hired Guns.

**Promotion (Van Saar Augmek or Van Saar Archeotek):** If, during the Downtime
phase of a campaign, this fighter has gained five or more Advancements, this fighter
may be promoted to become either a Van Saar Augmek or a Van Saar Archeotek as
the controlling player wishes.

When a fighter is promoted in this way, they will from now on count as a Van Saar
Augmek or a Van Saar Archeotek for the purposes of determining which equipment
and skill sets they can access. Their existing characteristics do not change, but they
will lose the Promotion (Van Saar Augmek or a Van Saar Archeotek), Hot-headed and
Fast Learner special rules and gain all the special rules associated with a Van Saar
Augmek or a Van Saar Archeotek, as appropriate.

Note that when a fighter is promoted in this way (especially when promoted to
become an Archeotek), an appropriate model should be used to represent their new
category and type.

**Hot-headed:** Fighters with this special rule have much to prove and often act on
impulse alone, hoping to impress their superiors. Consequently, older and wiser
fighters expect them to be short-lived. Should a fighter with this special rule be
Seriously Injured or be taken Out of Action, friendly fighters that are within 3" do not
have to take a Nerve test, unless they also have this special rule.

**Fast Learner:** During Campaign play, when this fighter gains a characteristic
Advancement, they do not need to spend an additional 2 XP if the characteristic
being improved has already been improved. In other words, this fighter may improve
a characteristic any number of times (up to the maximum) for the basic XP cost
shown each time.

_Reckless and young, Neoteks have yet to feel the full effects of the wasting inflicted on the Van Saar by their use of their STC’s technologies. They favour either untested or dangerous tech, and are perhaps most well-known for their use of grav-cutters. Racing through the hive’s close confines on a repulsor platform like a cutter might look cool but, as more than one Neotek has discovered, it can be fatal._
