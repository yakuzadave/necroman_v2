# Ironhead Squat Prospectors

_Humans are not the only race to have made their home on the blighted world of Necromunda, and of the many subspecies, mutants and even true xenos dwelling beneath its polluted skies, few are perhaps as important to its continued existence as the Squats. Imperial records are vague on the origins of these hardy creatures, only stating that perhaps somewhere in humanity’s dim and distant past they share a common ancestor with the humans of today. What is known, at least on Necromunda, is that the Squats came to that world some ten thousand years ago, not long after its conquest by the Imperium, when the scars of a galaxy- spanning civil war were still fresh on the face of the world, and much rebuilding needed to be done. For this task the Squats were unequalled in their skill, being a race of engineers, architects and craftsmen. Dozens of great Squat clans came to Necromunda in this time, and it is in no small part due to their efforts that the world prospered as it did, many within the hives oblivious to the debt they owe to the Squats._

_Centuries later, the Squats, or Ironhead Squats as they are known to the people of the wastes, live a seminomadic lifestyle in their great land trains, travelling from mining site to mining site syphoning off the wealth of 10,000 years of pollution to sell to the Clan Houses. These vast mechanical mining rigs are like cities on tracks, and the sound of their rumbling passage carries for kilometres in all directions as they crawl from one mine to the next. When a land train reaches a suitable dig site it forms a laager, or circle of great vehicles, and might stay for months or even years as it plunders the earth beneath its tracks. While the laager is in place, prospecting parties range out in all directions from it, seeking fresh finds and protecting their clan – until the time the laager is broken down, and the land train moves on to fresh prospecting grounds._
