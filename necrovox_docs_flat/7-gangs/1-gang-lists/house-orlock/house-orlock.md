# House Orlock

_They say the Orlocks have iron in their souls. But then you’d have to be made of the black ore of Necromunda to climb the spider’s web of Lord Helmawr’s feudal society as quickly as they have. In just three short millennia, House Orlock has risen from a loose alliance of Clan Families and waste prospectors to become the largest mining operation on the planet. It is a success built upon the backs of a massive slave underclass, the Drudges, born to scrape ore from the dark pits of the Spoil, or work endless cycles in the clan’s smoke- wreathed refineries. House Orlock has had a troubled history with this underclass, and at times they have threatened to rise up and tear down everything the Clan Families have fought to build. It speaks to the ruthlessness and determination of these families that they managed to endure these rebellions, ultimately building their entire social structure around the simmering discontentment within their ranks._

_From the outside, however, the troubled history of the Drudges is largely unknown, or at the very least discounted, and it is not these unwashed masses that most consider when they think of the Orlocks. The image of the House of Iron is one of veteran rebels, outland ash-riders and bare-knuckled hardmen. This is entirely intentional, and the heads of the Orlock mining families have worked long and hard to cultivate a soldier class within the clan to fight for its interests, and keep the drudging classes in line. At the top of the Orlock social ladder, a small group of families hold power over millions of subjects, who, should they ever unite, could sweep this ruling class away in a single violent uprising. It is only the clan’s gangs that stand in the way of these would-be rebels. As paradoxical as it might seem, most of these gangs come from the drudging classes themselves, selected for their rebellious nature and fierce independence. Thus do the ruling families weed out troublemakers before they have a chance to incite rebellion, and turn them back upon their own kind, with a promise of freedom and power._

## Gang Composition

### Road Captain (Leader)

|  M  | WS  | BS  |  S  |  T  |  W  |  I  |  A  | Ld  | Cl  | Wil | Int |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 5”  | 3+  | 3+  |  3  |  3  |  3  | 4+  |  2  | 4+  | 5+  | 5+  | 5+  |

**Skills:** 1 Primary (custom).  
**Restrictions:** None.  
**Special Rules:** Gang Leader, Gang Hierarchy (Leader), Tools of the Trade, Group Activation (2).

_Road Captains are without exception hard men and women, willing to thumb their nose at authority and forge their own path. However, Orlock gangers respect independence as much as strength, and a successful Road Captain needs to be the embodiment of both of these traits. Being a Road Captain means earning the respect of their gang through their own deeds. Unlike some gangs and clans of Necromunda, the brotherhoods and sisterhoods of House Orlock are a two-way street; if a leader in the House of Iron wants to have men and women follow them, then they had best be worthy of the right._

### Road Sergeant (Champion)

|  M  | WS  | BS  |  S  |  T  |  W  |  I  |  A  | Ld  | Cl  | Wil | Int |

**Skills:** 1 Primary (custom).  
**Restrictions:** None.  
**Special Rules:** Gang Hierarchy (Champion), Tools of the Trade, Group Activation (1).

_A good Road Sergeant can take orders from their Captain, but has enough initiative to break the rules to get the job done. The very best Sergeants know just when to question their Captains and anticipate what they want before they even have a solid plan in mind. A Road Sergeant also needs to be able to step into the boots of the Road Captain should the latter go down or get killed, keeping the gang together and fighting._

**Skills:** 1 Primary (custom).  
**Restrictions:** Pistol, Basic and Close Combat.  
**Special Rules:** Gang Hierarchy (Champion), Tools of the Trade, Group Activation (1).

#### Rule of Iron

- When activated, 1 visible Faction fighter within 6” gains the [Nerves of Steel](/docs/gang-fighters-and-their-weaponry/skills/#4-nerves-of-steel) skill (if not already having it).
- +2 modifier to any Bottle test while at least one friendly fighter with this ability is on the battlefield.

_If an Orlock gang gets large enough, it’s inevitable it’ll need an Arms Master to keep the Gunners and Greenhorns in line. Road Captains rely on their Arms Masters to enforce order within their gang, as well as leading by example – usually cracking heads or setting their cyber- mastiffs on those who cross the gang. To be an Arms Master means being hard as nails, even by the standards of House Orlock, and there are countless stories about these stony-faced fighters getting stabbed, blasted or shot and getting back up to make their enemies pay for making them mad._

**Restrictions:** Pistol, Basic, Close Combat.  
**Special Rules:** Gang Fighter (Ganger), Promotion (Orlock Specialist), Tools of the Trade (Orlock Specialist).

_The bulk of Orlock gangs are made up of Gunners, hive-hardened men and women with a rebellious streak a mile wide. Most often they are drawn up from the drudging classes, where they never really fit in among work crews and mining towns, the gangs their last chance to prove their worth._

**Restrictions:** Pistol, Special, Close Combat.  
**Special Rules:** Gang Fighter (Prospect), Tools of the Trade, Promotion (Orlock Road Sergeant or Arms Master), Hot-headed, Fast Learner.

#### Jump Booster

Usable once per activation during a Move (Simple) or Charge (Double) action. It can be used in one of two ways:

- **Safe mode:** +3” M.
- **Overcharge:**
  - +1 S and +1 hit modifier when charging.
  - Must roll a D6:  
    **1:** Pinned (malfunction, no move).  
    **2:** +4" M.  
    **3-4:** +5" M.  
    **5-6:** +6" M.

When used, Grenade and Template weapons gain Unstable (for the rest of the activation).

Up to half of the move can be vertical (can move between levels and over impassable terrain if having sufficient movement). If the movement end in the air (insufficient movement to land safely on a level surface), fall the remaining distance (if the distance is 2” or less, it counts as jumping down).

_In every Clan House there are those fighters who court danger to an even greater extent than normal underhive gangers. Among the members of House Orlock these risk-takers are the Wreckers. In the tangled confines of the underhive, they jump among the gantries and tumbled domes taking out enemy fighters – while at the same time making sure they don’t take their head off on a low-hanging ceiling or end up as a stain on the floor from a bad landing._

_Common across all of the worlds of the Imperium, servitors are melds of flesh andmachine, most often human flesh, but sometimes, as in the case of the Ambot, alien life forms slaved to a servitor engine. Most often, the human component of aservitor is harvested from a convicted criminal, one whose crimes are deemed toogreat to allow them to carry on as a part of Imperial society but who may continueto serve in another form rather than be wasted in incarceration or execution. Servitors possess the most rudimentary of human intelligence, their minds scrubbed of past memories and all but the most essential knowledge, artificial memory engrams grafted in their place so that they will know their designated roleand function and little else. Servitors are put to work in all manner of industry andfor any menial task with which an unmodified human cannot perform. They work inhostile environments, their living flesh variously blasted by extremes of heat and cold, eroded by extreme elements, or withered and wasted by toxic surroundings, performing their tasks until they fail, at which point their mechanics are reclaimedand a new human ‘donor’ grafted into place. House Orlock has ready access to mining and heavy industry servitors of all makes and manner, but those repurposedfor gang warfare often take the form referred to by the gangers as ‘Luggers’ – heavy, tracked units able to lift, move and carry bulky cargos. Be they liberated frommine workings or cargo depots, such constructs are well suited to a combat role with minimal reprogramming._

### 0-3 Cyber-Mastiff (Exotic Beast)

**Cost:** 100

**Wargear:** Savage Bite.  
**Special Rules:** Watchdog, Loyal Protector, Group Activation (Exotic Beasts).

#### Watchdog

If the owner is a sentry, attackers can be spotted outside the vision arc. Add 1+ modifier to spotting (a 1 before modifiers still fails).

#### Loyal Protector

While Standing (Active or Engaged) and within 3” of its owner, enemy fighters may not make a Coup de Grace against the owner.

_On Necromunda, dogs are no less common than anywhere else in the Imperium, though it must be said that they often provide a food source more readily than they provide their traditional roles of companion, guard or hunter. However, they do still have loyal friends amongst the people. Guilders breed and keep large hounds to protect their caravans and holdings, and House Orlock in particular takes great pride in the rearing of dogs as guards and fighters. The dogs of House Orlock show great diversity of type. From the sleek, alert watch dogs they raise to guard their mine workings and store houses, to the stocky, bull-like fighting dogs they breed for sport, Orlock Gangers are frequently accompanied by hounds. What’s more, to the outsider, there is a strange sentimentality shown by Orlocks towards their dogs, and it is not uncommon to see hounds sporting expensive cybernetics to compensate for past injuries or illness._
