# House Cawdor

_Faith; in all of Necromunda there are few weapons as dangerous or as enduring. Nothing yet created by the Noble Houses compares to the damage faith has done to their people, and nothing in the entire hive world unites its inhabitants so surely. Even the fear of Lord Helmawr and the Imperial House cannot compete with true faith, and it is in this that House Cawdor’s power lies. All the other Clan Houses and Noble Houses are built upon alliances, the exchange of wealth, and obligation; their roots tied inexplicably to the industry of the hive world. Though House Cawdor shares in this industry, it is not defined by it. Rather, where most count credits each cycle to measure the worth of their subjects, the people of Clan Cawdor consider themselves strong so long as their faith remains strong. This has saved Cawdor from extinction where so many other Clan Houses have succumbed to the march of time or the ebb and flow of production quotas. For even while Cawdor languishes beneath its peers in terms of wealth and military might, it has never been poor in its beliefs._

_From the outside, other Necromundans see House Cawdor as bonepickers, scavengers and beggars, little better than the hive rats that plague their holesteads. Only the mantle of being born of a Clan House elevates them above the clanless masses or the serf class, though most self-respecting subjects of Lord Helmawr will not deal with them. However, they do perform a vital role within hive society, picking through the refuse and cast-offs of the factoria, so that nothing might go to waste. If this were the only thing they were known for, Clan Cawdor might be better accepted by their peers. As it is, few can think of the Clan House without thinking of the faith that drives them. And they are not mistaken in this belief, for on Necromunda, Clan Cawdor and the Redemptionist faith are one and the same._

**Restrictions:** Pistol, Basic, Close Combat.  
**Special Rules:** Gang Fighter (Prospect), Tools of the Trade, Promotion (Cawdor Firebrand or Redemptionist Deacon), Born in the Saddle, Hot-headed, Fast Learner, Pious.

#### Promotion (Cawdor Firebrand or Redemptionist Deacon)

If, during the Downtime phase of a campaign, this fighter has gained five or more Advancements, this fighter may be promoted to become either a Cawdor Firebrand or a Redemptionist Deacon as the controlling player wishes.

When a fighter is promoted in this way, they will from now on count as a Cawdor Firebrand or a Redemptionist Deacon for the purposes of determining which equipment and skill sets they can access. Their existing characteristics do not change, but they will lose the Promotion (Cawdor Firebrand or Redemptionist Deacon), Born in the Saddle, Hot-headed, Fast Learner and Pious special rules and gain all the special rules associated with a Cawdor Firebrand or a Redemptionist Deacon, as appropriate.

Note that when a fighter is promoted in this way (especially when promoted to become a Redemptionist Deacon), an appropriate model should be used to
represent their new category and type.

#### Born in the Saddle

This fighter is more comfortable on their mount than onfoot and would never be without it. Their Ridge Walker must be included on every Fighter
card for this fighter.

#### Hot-headed

Fighters with this special rule have much to prove and often act on impulse alone, hoping to impress their superiors. Consequently, older and wiser
fighters expect them to be short-lived. Should a fighter with this special rule be Seriously Injured or be taken Out of Action, friendly fighters that are within 3" do not have to take a Nerve test, unless they also have this special rule.

#### Fast Learner

During Campaign play, when this fighter gains a characteristic Advancement, they do not need to spend an additional 2 XP if the characteristic being improved has already been improved. In other words, this fighter may improve a characteristic any number of times (up to the maximum) for the basic XP cost shown each time.

#### Pious

A devout member of House Cawdor, this fighter adheres closely to the teachings of the Redemption, whilst dutifully denying the path of the fanatic. In addition, if this fighter rolls a natural double 1 on their Cool check when making a Rally test, they may immediately re-roll that Cool check.

#### Flight

Ignores all terrain, moves freely between levels without
restriction and can never fall. May not ignore impassable
terrain or walls and may not end its movement with its base
overlapping an obstacle or the base of another fighter.

#### Bate

When the owning fighter activates, make a Willpower test for
the owning fighter. If failed, the Sheen Bird must attempt to
charge the closest enemy fighter. If passed, the Sheen Bird
activates as normal.

#### Rake Away

At the end of the activation, if the owner is Active or Pinned, a
Willpower test can be made. If passed, make a free Move
(Simple) action, or Retreat (Basic) action if Engaged, directly
towards the owning fighter.

_Ancient biomechanical constructs, created long ago to evoke an illusory sense of the long-lost splendour of the natural world, sheen birds were once wonders, combining the finest mechanical constructions of the Cult Cybernetica with the most elegant clone-craft of the Cult Biologus. They were possessed of a rudimentary programming, causing them to mimic real birds; flocking together, roosting, feeding, even nesting._

_Over the millennia, sheen bird numbers have gradually dwindled through lack of preservation, with the surviving examples becoming corrupted beyond recognition. Their flesh is diseased and their plumage is scarce. The remaining sheen birds are foul things, infested with parasites and filthy with pollution. Even their rudimentary programming has corrupted, causing them to act as sinister parodies of real birds._

_Occasionally, sheen birds will make their way into the lower levels of the underhive. Here they are greeted with awe by the devoted of House Cawdor, who view them as avatars of the Emperor’s grace. For high ranking Cawdor gangers, to possess a sheen bird is akin to possessing the direct blessing of the Emperor himself._

_Created by the Magi Biologis, cherub-servitors are a common sight on Imperial worlds, particularly so amongst the many branches of the Imperial Creed. Their use varies depending upon need, with many serving a purely decorative or ritual purpose, bearing censers or holy icons during the endless sermons of the Ecclesiarchy. Others carry small items for those they serve or, in some cases, operate machinery high in the domes and rafters of shrines and cathedrals._

_The Orders Militant and Frateris Militia are often accompanied to war by cherubservitors. Here they fulfil a number of roles, from porting ammunition and wargear to acting as a form of mobile cover or ablative armour, protecting those they serve by sacrificing their own vat-grown bodies. It is not uncommon to see well-funded Redemptionists similarly accompanied by cherub-servitors. How these criminal rabble rousers come into possession of such companions is something of a mystery, suggesting links to Noble Houses, and even sects within the Ecclesiarchy itself._

_The preachers and rabble-rousers of the devout of House Cawdor have little tolerance for the mutant and the abhuman. Such deformities of the body are clear evidence, so their leaders tell them, of the corruption that lurks within the soul. How can anyone who lives their life in loyalty to the Emperor, anyone who dedicates their every action to his glory, their every moment of toil to the betterment of his Imperium, ever become so corrupt and debased of form? Physical abnormalities are clear evidence, then, that those afflicted have turned their gaze away from his light and shunned Him as their one true master, and so the devout of House Cawdor will hunt them down and exterminate such affronts to Him on Terra with great prejudice, wherever they attempt to hide from his light._

_And yet, exceptions not only exist within the teeming ranks of House Cawdor, but could even be called… common. Many denizens of Cawdor are lame of body or weak of wit. Many are abnormally large or strangely proportioned and peculiar to behold. How it is that such variation from the accepted baseline norm of humanity can be tolerated within a House that claims to despise such variations is something of a mystery, but to the Cawdor themselves the answer is simply one of faith. If their leaders choose to allow these souls to live, then live they will, just like any other Cawdor, dedicating their lives to the holy cause. A common sight amongst the peoples of House Cawdor is that of the physically frail and the weak of mind coexisting, working together to do for one another that which they cannot do alone. Sometimes regarded as bearers of stigma, sometimes called ‘stigs’ amongst the gangs of House Cawdor, but never ‘mutants’, lest the speaker wish to provoke a violent reaction, these combinations of shambling, slack-jawed behemoth and shrewd-yet-wizened rider can be a great asset to any Cawdor gang seeking to establish dominance in the underhive._

_Truly, House Cawdor is home to some strange sights indeed!_
