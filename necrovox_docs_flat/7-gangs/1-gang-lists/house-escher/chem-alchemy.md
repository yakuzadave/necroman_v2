# Escher Chem-Alchemy

_Source: House of Blades_

House Escher gangs benefit from the prodigious output
of the clan’s Chymist Cults. All manner of stimms,
chems and toxins are available to Gang Queens and
their fighters, enhancing their natural abilities and
making even the slightest scratch of their stiletto
knives and swords exceptionally deadly. In addition to
the standard selection of chems, toxins and poisonous
gases available on Necromunda, House Escher gangs
can buy speciality concoctions and compounds from
those detailed below.

## Using Chem-Alchemy

When an Escher gang visits the Trading Post during the
post-battle sequence, they can buy a Chem-alchemy
Elixir in the Purchase Equipment step. Chem-alchemy
Elixirs are considered to be part of the gang’s House
Equipment List, and so do not require a Seek Rare
Equipment roll to be purchased.

When a gang buys a Chem-alchemy Elixir, they must
decide what kind of chem (Stimm, Toxic Ammo or
Gaseous Ammo) it will be, and what its effects will be.
This is done when it is purchased, and will affect its
final cost. Creating a Chem-alchemy Elixir is done using
the following steps:

- Choose a chem type either: Stimm, Toxic Ammo or Gaseous Ammo
- Choose up to three effects from the chosen chem’s effect list
- Add up the credit cost of each effect to find the final cost of the chem

Each time a chem is bought, regardless of the number
of effects it includes, it represents a single dose
or application.

A dose or application lasts for the duration of a single
battle (unless otherwise noted) then it is used up and
removed from the gang’s stash.

## Stimms

Stimms are beneficial chems fighters use to heal
themselves, enhance their fighting abilities, or protect
themselves against poisons and other perils. A stimm
counts as Wargear. A fighter can start a battle under
the effects of any stimm they are equipped with if they
choose, or can administer that stimm during a battle
to themselves or a friendly fighter in base contact by
performing an **Administer Dose (Simple)** action during
their activation.

| Stimm Effects | Cost |
| :-----------: | :--: |
|   Bad Blood   |  10  |
|  Blood Rush   |  15  |
|  Brain Lock   |  15  |
|   Dreamland   |  10  |
|     Hyper     |  20  |
|   Ice Cold    |  15  |
|     Jolt      |  30  |
|  Night Night  |  25  |
|     Puke      |  15  |
|   Wide-eye    |  10  |

### Bad Blood

_This stimm contains genophaic haem-mimics that modify the subject’s haemoglobin. The result is to make the blood highly toxic to all but the carrier, ensuring a single drop is enough to kill if it comes into contact with another fighter._

**Effect:** When a fighter under the effects of
this chem suffers one or more Wounds and/
or Flesh Wounds, all fighters in base contact
with them must make an Initiative check. If
this check is failed, they are considered to have
taken a hit from a weapon with the Toxin trait.

### Blood Rush

_Created from a collection of plasmid-modified cells, Blood Rush rapidly knits together torn flesh and thereby stops bleeding._

**Effect:** When this stimm is administered to a fighter,
that fighter may remove a single Flesh Wound or
immediately recover from being Seriously Injured.

### Brain Lock

Psychoactive stimms fill the fighter’s brain, allowing them to disrupt malign energies in the area around them by strength of will.

**Effect:** A fighter under the effects of this stimm
counts as a Psyker for the purposes of disrupting
enemy psychic powers (as described in the
Necromunda Rulebook).

### Dreamland

_The neural blockers contained in this stimm interfere with receptors associated with harmful thoughts that might otherwise affect the fighter._

**Effect:** A fighter under the effects of this stimm ignores
the effects of the Insane condition.

### Hyper

_Cortical-kinetic impellers energise the motive pathways of the fighter’s body, giving them thought-quick movements and blinding reflexes._

**Effect:** A fighter under the effects of this stimm
increases their Movement characteristic by 2, and,
when they take the Charge (Double) Action, they add
D6" to their movement rather than D3". This increased
level of hyper-activity makes them exceptionally twitchy,
and they must reduce all their hit rolls by 1.

### Ice Cold

_Created from strains of Kalma and Spur, this stimm dulls reality without deadening the senses or making the subject docile._

**Effect:** A fighter under the effects of this stimm adds 2
to any Cool checks they are required to make.

### Jolt

_A blast of powerful stimulants floods the fighter’s body, allowing them to shrug off their injuries and get back into the fight – at least until the chems wear off._

**Effect:** Until the end of the round in which this stimm
was administered, a fighter under the effects of this
stimm counts any Serious Injuries they suffer as
Flesh Wounds.

### Night Night

_Sometimes the only way to keep death at bay is to have a good sleep. Night Night uses bio-anaesthesitics to put the subject into a healing coma._

**Effect:** When a fighter under the effects of this stimm
goes Out of Action, do not roll for a Lasting Injury.
Instead, the fighter counts as having rolled a result of
12-26 Out Cold on the Lasting Injury table. Note that
the fighter may still be captured as normal.

### Puke

_This stimm pumps potent counter-toxins into the fighter’s system, the tiny microbes purging any foreign agents introduced into their bloodstream._

**Effect:** A fighter under the effects of this stimm
doubles their Toughness when testing to see if they are
affected by weapons with the Toxin or Gas traits.

### Wide-Eye

_The chem contains ocular stimulants that expand the subject’s pupils and sharpens their mind so they are capable of noticing even the minutest of details._

**Effect:** A fighter under the effects of this stimm ignores
the effects of the Pitch Black rules. In addition, if the
fighter is a Sentry in a battle using the Sneak Attack
rules (as described in the Necromunda Rulebook)
then they always count enemy fighters as being ‘in
the open’.

## Gaseous Ammo

This includes all manner of collected poisonous
chemicals and vapours carefully sorted and stored
by the Chymist Cults. Their effects can range from
knocking a victim out to driving them insane with
wild hallucinations, blinding them, or even burning
through respirators.

A fighter equipped with Gaseous Ammo can apply its
effects to any weapon they are equipped with that has
the Gas trait during the pre-battle sequence, once
crews have been selected.

Once applied to a weapon with the Gas trait, Gaseous
Ammo will change the profile and Traits of the weapon
as noted in the appropriate entry for the duration of
that battle. Their effects expire during the Wrap-up.

| Gas Effects  | Cost |
| :----------: | :--: |
|    Acidic    |  20  |
|     Bane     |  15  |
|   Blackout   |  30  |
|   Blinding   |  10  |
|  Expansive   |  20  |
| Hallucinogen |  15  |
|    Leaden    |  30  |
|   Liftin’    |  25  |
|  Pathogenic  |  15  |
|  Pyrophoric  |  20  |

### Acidic

_Caustic compounds within the gas eat away at filters and seals, making a mockery of respirators and hazard suits. However, such gases, while able to work their way through such defences, are not as lethal as true biopathic toxins._

**Effect:** A fighter hit by a weapon with the Gas trait with
this Gaseous Ammo applied does not benefit from
armour or Wargear that would normally increase their
Toughness against weapons with the Gas trait (i.e.,
respirators). Out of Action results on the Injury dice
generated by hits from a weapon with the Gas trait with
this Gaseous Ammo applied count as Seriously Injured
results instead.

### Bane

_Some chemical compounds are designed to specifically attack the weakest points on ponderous machines or massive creatures, working their way into eyes, mouths and organs that might otherwise be protected from conventional weapons._

**Effect:** A fighter hit by a weapon with the Gas trait with
this Gaseous Ammo applied counts their Toughness as
3, regardless of their actual Toughness characteristic.
Note that Wargear such as a respirator can still
modify the fighter’s Toughness against Gas weapons
as normal.

### Blackout

_Blackout contains potent flurane chems. These are powerful mixtures of knockout drugs and the slightest whiff can render a fighter instantly unconscious._

**Effect:** If a fighter suffers a Serious Injury from a
weapon with the Gas trait with this Gaseous Ammo
applied, they are taken Out of Action, just as if they
had rolled an Out of Action result. Fighters taken Out of
Action by a weapon with the Gas trait with this Gaseous
Ammo applied do not need to roll on the Lasting Injury
table. Instead, the fighter counts as having rolled a
result of 12-26 Out Cold on the Lasting Injury table.

### Blinding

_Bio-adhesives in Blinding gas infiltrate the victim’s eyes, restricting their blood flow to rob them of their sight. Though these debilitating effects are short lived, they often last long enough for the victim’s enemies to finish them off._

**Effect:** A fighter that suffers a Flesh Wound from a
weapon with the Gas trait with this Gaseous Ammo
applied becomes subject to the Blind condition until
the End phase of the current round.

### Expansive

_Helio-molecular stimulation of toxic gases allows Expansive gas to disperse over an extremely large area._

**Effect:** This Gaseous Ammo can only be applied to a
weapon that has both the Gas and Blast (X") traits.
When placing a Blast marker generated by a weapon
with the Gas trait with this Gaseous Ammo applied, a
fighter may place one more Blast marker than normal.
This marker must be placed so that it is touching at
least one other Blast marker generated by this weapon.

### Hallucinogen

_Hallucinogen gases contain aggressive psychogenic chems that attack the subject’s mind and make them doubt their own senses._

**Effect:** A fighter hit by a weapon with the Gas trait with
this Gaseous Ammo applied must make a Willpower
check in addition to the Toughness check to resist the
effects of being hit by a weapon with the Gas trait. If
this Willpower check is failed, the fighter immediately
becomes subject to the Insane condition.

### Leaden

_Leaden gases are incredibly dense, causing bursts to settle upon the battlefield and increase their dispersal time._

**Effect:** After resolving an attack using a weapon with
the Gas trait with this Gaseous Ammo applied, place
a 3" Blast marker so that its central hole is within the
area of the Flame template or Blast marker placed
when making the attack.

Any fighters that move through this Blast marker count
as being hit by the weapon that made this attack (work
out this hit when the fighter ends their current action).
This Blast marker remains in play until the End phase
of the current round.

### Liftin’

_Liftin’ gases have had their composition altered, decreasing their density without sacrificing their potency, allowing them to be sprayed further from weapons such as chem throwers._

**Effect:** This Gaseous Ammo can only be applied to a
weapon that has both the Gas and Template traits.
When making an attack using a weapon with the Gas
trait with this Gaseous Ammo applied, the template
may be placed up to 6" away from the fighter making
the attack. When placing the template, it must be
positioned so the narrow end points directly towards
the fighter making the attack. The wide end of the
template must be the furthest part of the template
from the fighter.

### Pathogenic

_There are many kinds of microbic chems that induce rapid necrosis in human flesh, and the Chymist Cults are adept at weaponising many of them. Pathogenics can quickly kill their victim if a counter-agent is not deployed in time._

**Effect:** After a fighter is hit by a weapon with the
Gas trait with this Gaseous Ammo applied, place a
marker next to them. At the start of that fighter’s next
activation, roll a D6. On a 3+, immediately remove
this marker. On a roll of 1 or 2, the fighter immediately
suffers the effects of the Gas trait, just as if they had
been hit by the same weapon again.

### Pyrophoric

_Pyrophoric gases are particularly insidious, clinging to their targets for extended periods of time and remaining self-fuelling in their immolation._

**Effect:** A weapon with the Gas trait with this Gaseous
Ammo applied gains the Blaze trait.

## Toxic Ammo

The toxins used by the Chymist Cults are virulent
poisons and the most extreme kinds of weaponised
chemicals. Their effects can range from causing
wounds that won’t stop bleeding to driving their victims
into a killing frenzy, from relentlessly attacking their
system to even causing their organs to explode!

A fighter equipped with a Toxic Ammo can apply its
effects to any weapon they are equipped with that has
the Toxin trait during the pre-battle sequence, once
crews have been selected.

Once applied to a weapon with the Toxin trait, Toxic
Ammo will change the profile and traits of the weapon
as noted in the appropriate entry for the duration of
that battle. Their effects expire during the Wrap-up.

| Toxin Effects | Cost |
| :-----------: | :--: |
|   Bleeding    |  10  |
| Concentrated  |  15  |
| Debilitating  |  10  |
|   Decaying    |  5   |
|   Exploding   |  20  |
|   Maddening   |  5   |
|    Maiming    |  10  |
|   Panicking   |  10  |
|  Paralysing   |  5   |
|   Silencing   |  5   |

### Bleeding

_Anticoagulant compounds are laced into the toxin, causing wounds to bleed freely once inflicted._

**Effect:** If a fighter is Injured by a weapon with the Toxin
trait with this Toxic Ammo applied, and is not taken Out
of Action, place a marker on their Fighter card. At the
beginning of each End phase, each of these markers is
removed and replaced with a Flesh Wound.

### Concentrated

_Concentrated toxins have a short-lived potency, but are highly effective at delivering a strong dose of poison right into the heart of their victims._

**Effect:** The first time a weapon with the Toxin trait with
this Toxic Ammo applied hits an enemy fighter, add
2 to the dice roll to see if it overcomes the fighter’s
Toughness. Note that this Toxic Ammo only affects
this weapon’s first successful hit, and any subsequent
hits, even during the same action, will be worked out
as normal.

### Debilitating

_Debilitating toxins can cause blindness, partial paralysis, or enfeeblement._

**Effect:** If a fighter is Injured by a weapon with the
Toxin trait with this Toxic Ammo applied, and is not
taken Out of Action, place a marker on their Fighter
card. For each marker on their Fighter card, a fighter
must subtract 1 from any Characteristic checks they
are required to make. At the end of the battle, or if the
fighter goes Out of Action, remove these markers from
their Fighter card.

### Decaying

_Necrotic acids are used to create toxins that can not only poison living organisms but also eat away at armour making their victims more vulnerable to further harm._

**Effect:** If a fighter is Injured by a weapon with the
Toxin trait with this Toxic Ammo applied, and is not
taken Out of Action, place a marker on their Fighter
card. For each marker on their Fighter card, a fighter
must subtract 1 from any Save rolls they are required
to make. At the end of the battle, or if the fighter
goes Out of Action, remove these markers from their
Fighter card.

### Exploding

_The hexaphagic venoms in explosive toxins attack their victims at a cellular level, literally expanding their organs until they explode in a shower of blood and gore._

**Effect:** If a fighter is taken Out of Action by a hit from
a weapon with the Toxin trait with this Toxic Ammo
applied, before removing them from the battlefield
place a 3" Blast marker over that fighter, with the
marker’s hole centred on their base. All fighters
touched by this Blast marker suffer an immediate hit
as if from a weapon with the Gas trait.

### Maddening

_Psycho-conductive chems make Maddening poisons not only potentially deadly but are also capable of driving their victims into a frenzied rage._

**Effect:** If a fighter is Injured by a weapon with the Toxin
trait with this Toxic Ammo applied, for the remainder of
the battle all their attacks gain the Reckless trait.

### Maiming

_Maiming toxins are filled with nano-caustic chems that tear the victim’s body apart from the inside, leaving savage, lasting wounds even if they survive the poison’s initial effects._

**Effect:** If a fighter is taken Out of Action by a weapon
with the Toxin trait with this Toxic Ammo applied, the
opposing player may roll twice on the Lasting Injuries
table and choose which of the two results to apply.

### Panicking

_Even a small drop of these kinds of nerve agents can send uncontrollable flesh quakes through a victim’s muscles, sending their heart racing and their mind spiralling into a pit of terror and despair._

**Effect:** If a fighter is Injured by a weapon with the Toxin
trait with this Toxic Ammo applied, they immediately
become Broken, as if they had failed a Nerve test.

### Paralysing

_Cortical inhibitors are common medicae chems used to keep patients still during surgeries. When mixed with deadly poisons, they ensure that should the target live through the effects of the toxins they will be going nowhere._

**Effect:** If a fighter is Injured by a weapon with the
Toxin trait with this Toxic Ammo applied, they must
immediately make a Strength check or become
Paralysed. A Paralysed fighter counts as being subject
to the Webbed condition.

### Silencing

_Silencing toxins contain chemicals that target the victim’s vocal organs and auditory senses, effectively isolating them from the world around them._

**Effect:** If a fighter is Injured by a weapon with the Toxin
trait with this Toxic Ammo applied, for the remainder
of the round they cannot issue or be part of Group
Activations.

### Naming Your Chems

Part of the fun of creating your own chems and
poisons is coming up with names for them! Players
are encouraged to experiment combining the
effects provided to find the concoction that is
right for their gang. For example, a poisonous Gas
combining Acidic, Blinding and Pyrophoric traits
might be known as Eyebite Gas, while one with the
Expansive and Liftin’ traits could be known on the
streets as Khimerix Breath. With the Arbitrator’s
permission, in a campaign an Escher gang might
even concoct these poisons and sell them to other
gangs, creating their own clandestine trade in
stimms, chem weapons and toxic blades.

### Designer’s Commentary: New Rules For House Escher Gangs

Presented below are special rules that will allow you to recreate the events described in [Apocrypha Necromunda: Queen of Ash Town](https://www.warhammer-community.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/LY6kk10sz3uV0hmQ.pdf), as well as new options for House Escher gangs. If the Arbitrator wishes, these rules can be used during a campaign.

_Source: Apocrypha Necromunda: Queens of Ash Town_

:::

If your gang includes an Apprentice Clan Chymist, then the following may be purchased as Chem-alchemy
Elixirs. Note that unlike other Chem-alchemy Elixirs, these may not be combined with other chems and an
Apprentice Clan Chymist does not reduce their credit cost.

### Blood Boil (Toxic Ammo)

**+30 Credits**

_Blood Boil is a deadly concoction of Esmer Tul’s own devising. It causes a victim’s organs to rupture and destroy themselves whilst driving them mad with agony._

**Effect:** Whenever a weapon with the Toxin trait with this Toxic Ammo applied hits an enemy fighter, add 1
to the dice roll to see if it overcomes the fighter’s Toughness. In addition, the weapon has the Exploding and
Maddening Toxin Effects applied to it.

### Skin Fire (Toxic Ammo)

**+25 Credits**

_Skin Fire is a vicious chem that upon contact with a person’s skin changes the chemistry of their blood so that it becomes extremely flammable, whilst the area around the wound blackens and decays._

**Effect:** If a fighter is Injured by a weapon with the Toxin trait with this Toxic Ammo applied, and is not taken
Out of Action, roll a D6; on a 4+ the fighter becomes subject to the Blaze condition. In addition, the weapon
has the Debilitating and Decaying Toxin Effects applied to it.

### Predator’s Kiss (Stimm)

**+45 Credits**

_A potent mix, Predator’s Kiss combines the Blood Rush and Hyper stimms with Esmer Tul’s own addition distilled from the pheromone glands of Phelynx. The result burns away a fighter’s fatigue, replacing it with a burning strength and a desire to do great violence._

**Effect:** A fighter under the effect of this Stimm adds 1 to their Strength characteristic for the purposes of close
combat attacks, though all of their weapons gain the Reckless trait. In addition, they have the Blood Rush and
Hyper Stimm Effects applied to them.
