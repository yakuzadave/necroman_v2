# Escher Terrain

_Source: House of Blades_

Gangs often make cunning use of terrain in their battles against their rivals.
Sometimes this is whatever is lying around the underhive battlefield, such as barrels
for cover or boltholes from which to launch ambushes. Other times they bring the
terrain with them, setting up fixed weapon platforms, defensive barricades or piles of
ammo crates within easy reach of their fighters.

Escher gangs can call upon a number of specialist terrain features to include in their
gang. These pieces of terrain are bought from the Trading Post during the post-battle
sequence. Once bought, they are added to the gang’s stash, and can be fielded in
any battle the gang plays unless noted otherwise.

## Placing Gang Terrain

Gang terrain is placed on the battlefield before any fighters are deployed. A gang
can place its terrain in its own deployment area, or, if noted, in no-man’s-land (i.e.,
anywhere outside their opponent’s deployment zone and their own deployment
zone). Some pieces of terrain (as noted in their descriptions) can only be used if the
gang is the defender in a scenario with an attacker and a defender.

### Hidden Traps

Some traps are cunningly hidden among the gloom and debris of the underhive,
fighters not knowing if a pile of rubble is just more rubbish or a deadly surprise.
If a trap uses the Hidden Traps rule then it is represented on the battlefield by
not one but six markers. These markers can be tokens, or appropriate terrain
elements on 25mm bases. When preparing these markers, one out of the six
is the real trap (mark its underside, or secretly make a note to determine which
one is real), the others are false traps. When a fighter triggers a trap, as detailed
in the trap’s description, it is revealed. False traps are discarded while the real
trap remains on the board. Note that even when the real trap is revealed, other
false traps remain on the board until they have been interacted with – this is
important if more than one trap is in play, as it will keep the enemy guessing as
to just how many traps remain to be discovered.

## Gas Canisters

Escher gas canisters are homemade containers for the gang’s toxic compounds or
airborne chems. In battle, a ganger can tap one of these makeshift containers to
reload their gas weapons or give them an extra boost. The danger of having so much
poisonous gas in one place, of course, is if a stray round ruptures them, they can
saturate an area in toxins, killing friend and foe alike.

Gas Canisters can be represented by a marker, or an appropriate model placed on a
25mm base. Gas Canisters can be moved in the same manner as Loot caskets (see
the Necromunda Rulebook). A friendly fighter within 1" of a Gas Canister can use it as
if it were chem-synth, increasing the lethality of their Gas weapons. Note that unlike
a normal chem-synth, a Gas Canister can only be used to enhance weapons with the
Gas trait.

Gas Canisters can be targeted by ranged attacks just as if they were fighters, and
may be affected by Blast and Template weapons if they are touched by a Blast
marker or Template marker. Gas Canisters have a Toughness of 3, and if they take
any damage are destroyed and removed from the battlefield. When a Gas Canister
is destroyed, place a 3" Blast marker over its position before removing it from the
battlefield. All fighters touched by this marker take a hit from a weapon with the
Gas trait.

## Blade Cages (Trap)

Blade Cages are cruel but effective mantraps. With pressure plates or tripwires to
set them off, they are bladed claws that rise up from the ground or descend from
the ceiling to envelop their victims. Those caught in a Blade Cage are left with the
unenviable task of trying to struggle free, hoping they don’t cut themselves to pieces
in the process.

Blade Cages are Traps, and use the Hidden Traps rules. Blade Cages can be set up
anywhere on the battlefield outside of your opponent’s deployment area.

When an enemy fighter moves within 2" of a Blade Cage marker, they must
immediately stop and make an Initiative check. If this check is passed, they can
continue their movement as normal. If it is failed, flip over the marker to see if it is
the real trap as per the Hidden Traps rule. If it is a false trap, discard the marker. If
it is the real trap, the fighter is moved into base contact with the marker and gains
the Webbed condition. As long as a Blade Cage has trapped a fighter, it cannot trap
additional fighters, and fighters moving past it do not need to make Initiative checks
to see if they are caught.

Blade Cages can be removed by performing the Disarm (Basic) Action and passing
an Intelligence check, while within 1" of the marker. If this check is failed, the fighter
becomes trapped as detailed above.

## Decapitators (Trap)

Decapitators are far less subtle versions of Blade Cages. Using spring-loaded or
pneumatic driven blades, they make for savage and messy booby traps.

Decapitators are Traps and use the Hidden Traps rules. Decapitators can be set up
anywhere on the battlefield outside of your opponent’s deployment area.

When an enemy fighter moves within 2" of a Decapitator marker, they must
immediately stop and make an Initiative check. If this check is passed, they can
continue their movement as normal. If it is failed, flip over the marker to see if it is
the real trap. If it is a false trap, discard the marker. If it is the real trap, the fighter
must immediately roll an Injury dice and apply the results.

Decapitators can be removed by performing the Disarm (Basic) Action and passing
an Intelligence check, while within 1" of the marker. If this check is failed, the fighter
must roll an Injury dice as detailed above.

## Gas Censers

Gas Censers hung from domes or doorways slowly release toxins into the air. They
can be represented by either a marker or a piece of terrain on a 25mm base. Gas
Censers can be set up anywhere on the battlefield outside of your opponent’s
deployment area.

In the End phase, a fighter within 3" of a Gas Censer must make a Toughness
check, adding any bonuses to the roll for Wargear and armour that protects against
weapons with the Gas trait. If this check is failed, or the roll was a 6, the fighter
suffers an immediate Flesh Wound.

Gas Censers can be thrown by a friendly fighter in base contact with them, just as if
they were a grenade. Work out this attack as normal, counting the Gas Censer as a
Choke Gas grenade. Once the attack has been worked out, remove the marker from
the battlefield.

## Chymist Cult Relic (Gang Relic)

House Escher gang relics are altars to the Chymist Cults. Whether they are massive
bladed icons of the House, or spiked pillars hung with the trophies of the gang’s kills,
they incorporate chem-stills and toxin filters. A Chymist Cult Relic counts as a Gang
Relic (see the Necromunda Rulebook). In addition, a friendly fighter within 3" of a
Chymist Cult Relic can use it as if it were chem-synth, increasing the lethality of their
Gas and Toxin weapons. Seriously Injured friendly fighters within 3" of a Chymist Cult
Relic count as being assisted by a friendly fighter making Recovery rolls.

Enemy fighters who end their activation within 3" of a Chymist Cult Relic must make
a Toughness check, adding any bonuses to the roll for Wargear and armour that
protects against weapons with the Gas trait, or immediately suffer a Flesh Wound.

Escher gangs can only include a Chymist Cult Relic if they are the defender in a
scenario with an attacker and defender. A Chymist Cult Relic can be represented by
an appropriate marker or a suitably impressive piece of industrial terrain, painted in
the colours of the gang and hung with Escher icons.

Note that if the relic is defiled (see the Necromunda Rulebook), it loses the bonuses
it provides to Cool and Leadership checks, but retains its other benefits.
