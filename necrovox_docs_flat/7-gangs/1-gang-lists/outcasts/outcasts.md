_Though it might not always appear so, Necromunda is a world bound by strict rules and ancient societal structures. From birth, a hiver will know their place in the great machine that is the hive world, doing their part to ensure a never-ending supply of munitions and other goods rolls out of its factoria. It is rare for a hiver to reject their station, and rarer still for them to cast off the hierarchy of House and hive altogether. Even the so-called criminals of Necromunda are part of the system, as are the Clan House gangs who wreak sanctioned violence in the underhive. Helots, cults and even heretics are also part of the system, the former vital property of the Houses, the latter clearly defined enemies of the Imperium and therefore an expected evil. There are, of course, those who do not fit into these structures, either as loyal servants of the Houses, members of the Merchant Guild or criminal fraternity, or even as part of the organised cultist underground. Collectively, these hivers are known as outcasts, and it is from their ranks that the majority of hive scum hail._

## Gang Composition

All Underhive Outcasts gangs must always follow these rules:

- There must be one fighter with the Leader special rule.
- When creating the gang, there can be no more than two fighters with the Gang Hierarchy (Champion) special rule in the gang.
- During Campaign play, there can be one fighter with the Gang Hierarchy (Champion) special rule for every three fighters with the Gang Fighter (X) special rule.
- The total number of fighters with the Gang Fighter (X) special rule in the gang must always be equal to, or higher than, the total number of fighters without the Gang Fighter (X) special rule combined, not counting Hangers-on or Hired Guns.
- The Underhive Outcasts gang does not contain any Juves; whenever a rule refers to a Juve it instead affects an Underhive Outcasts Hive Scum.

Should it occur during the course of a campaign that the number of fighters without the Gang Fighter (X) special rule exceeds the total number of fighters with
the Gang Fighter (X) special rule, the controlling player must either:

- Recruit fresh fighters with the Gang Fighter (X) special rule in order to correct the imbalance.

Or:

- Retire a number of fighters without the Gang Fighter (X) special rule special rule during the post-battle sequence in order to correct the imbalance.

### Delegation Gangs

_When an individual decides, or is forced, to become an outcast they do not always go alone. Although rare, it is not unheard of for their fellow brothers and sisters in arms to join them._

Necromunda boasts a variety of unique fighters dedicated to the various factions of Necromunda found in a variety of books. Some of these can be adapted into Underhive Outcasts gangs, allowing players to create a gang based upon a Guild, Criminal or Noble Delegation. If the player wishes, and the campaign Arbitrator agrees, players can use such a Delegation as the heart of their Underhive Outcasts gang as follows:

[List of Delegation Gangs](delegation-gangs.md).

### Gorvos Twins

:::note DESIGNER’S COMMENTARY

Presented below are special rules that will allow you to recreate the events described in Twins of Two Tunnels, as well as new options for Underhive Outcast gangs. If the Arbitrator wishes, these rules can be used during a campaign.

:::

When founding an Underhive Outcast gang they can be led by Gaen ‘The Gunk Queen’ Gorvos and have her brother Vunder Gorvos as a Champion. To do so, apply the following effects:

- Gaen ‘The Gunk Queen’ Gorvos is the gang’s Leader. She has the Criminal Organisation Affiliation and Mastermind Archetype.
- Vunder Gorvos is one of the gang’s Champions. He has the Survivor Archetype.
- All members of the gang may take [gunk bombs](/docs/armoury/grenades#gunk-bomb) for 20 credits each.

## Special Rules

### Creating an Underhive Outcasts Leader

The player can create their own leader using the [Underhive Outcasts Leader profile](#leader) presented below. When selecting a leader in this way the player must choose one of the multiple profiles presented to represent their leader, and choose an **Affiliation** and **Archetype**. These choices allow the player to create an Underhive Outcast Leader suited to a particular miniature or background of their choosing. Once these choices have been made, they cannot be altered.

### Elevating an Underhive Outcasts Leader

Alternatively, the player can choose an existing fighter profile and elevate them to Underhive Outcasts Leader
status. This fighter can come from any Necromunda publication and includes, but is not limited to: Clan House gang leaders, Guild, Noble and Criminal fighters, Dramatis Personae and Hangers-on. Once a profile has been selected, the player then follows the steps on listed here to elevate them to Leader status. Once a fighter has been elevated, they are then considered to be the Leader of the gang.

:::note DESIGNER’S NOTE: ELEVATING A FIGHTER TO LEADER STATUS
There are many kinds of Underhive Outcasts Leaders that can be created using the profiles, Archetypes and
Affiliations presented in this section. It might be, however, that you want to create an Underhive Outcasts gang
centred around an existing fighter from another gang list or Necromunda publication. This is entirely appropriate,
as Bounty Hunters, Hangers-on and even Dramatis Personae might all rise up to lead a gang at some point or
another in their careers.

- The first step is to choose a fighter to become your Underhive Outcasts Leader. This can be literally any fighter with a profile, whether they could normally be part of a gang or not. Dramatis Personae, Hangers-on and Hired Guns are particularly suited to becoming gang leaders and should prove easy to convert. Other kinds of fighters might need more work, and some should probably only be allowed with the agreement of the campaign Arbitrator (as fun as it would be to have a gang of Underhive Outcasts led by a sentient Scrapcode Ambot!).
- The fighter retains any skills, equipment or special rules they might have. Alternatively, you can replace their skills and equipment with those available to an Underhive Outcasts Leader. Whichever option is taken, you need to choose an appropriate Affiliation and Archetype for the fighter.
- The fighter retains their cost in credits, and throughout a campaign gains Experience and can be equipped with Wargear like a normal fighter.
- The fighter gains all the special rules an Underhive Outcasts Leader has.

Note that due to the incredibly wide variety of fighters available to be elevated to an Underhive Outcasts Leader,
this method may lead to some unbalanced gangs. The campaign Arbitrator always has the final say on whether
these rules can be used and how they are applied.

:::

### Death of an Underhive Outcasts Leader

All Underhive Outcasts gangs must include a single fighter with the ‘Gang Leader’ special rule. This fighter is, naturally, the leader of the gang.

If an Underhive Outcasts gang’s leader is killed, the gang falls apart. When this happens, a new Underhive Outcasts gang will often form to fill the power vacuum.

To represent this, follow these steps:

- Create a new gang following all the normal rules for founding an Underhive Outcasts Gang, with the exception that the starting credits for the new gang is equal to 75% of the previous gang’s Wealth after fully resolving the post-battle sequence or 1,000 credits, whichever is higher.
- Fighters from the previous gang can be added to this new gang; just pay their credit cost and add them to the roster.
- If at least half of the fighters from the previous gang are included in the new gang, it starts with D6 less Reputation (to a minimum of 1) but still has any territory or settlement structures previously held. Otherwise, the new gang starts from scratch with nothing in the previous gang’s Stash carried over.

### Affiliation

_No one on Necromunda can escape the crushing social structure of the hives. Subjects of the Imperial House are born into servitude or obligation and live out their lives seldom rising or falling far beyond their station. Even so-called outcasts, who reject the notions of House and hive, cannot escape the circumstances of their heritage; they carry it with them into the badzones and beyond when they try to shake off the rule of Lord Helmawr._

To represent the huge variety of potential Underhive Outcasts Leaders, when an Underhive Outcasts gang is created its Leader must choose an Affiliation. An Affiliation is a glimpse into the origins of the Leader, or speaks to the contacts they still maintain with those more mainstream members of society. There are five different Affiliations an Underhive Outcasts Leader can choose from: Clanless, Clan House, Merchant Guild, Criminal Organisation or Noble House. Each comes with its own advantages and disadvantages, but most importantly will determine the equipment the Underhive Outcasts Leader and their gang have access to, as well as the kinds of Alliances they might be able to make. Once the choice of Affiliation has been made, it cannot be changed – not even an outcast can escape their past.

#### Clanless

_This is the most common Affiliation for an outcast leader. It represents a leader without any strong ties to any of the great organisations of Necromunda, or a true outlander who was raised beyond the social structures of the hive. Clanless leaders are universally looked down upon by the rest of Necromunda and must work all the harder to prove themselves. Being clanless does come with some benefits, as those who have never been beholden to the rules of the Imperial House find breaking them all the easier._

A Clanless Underhive Outcasts Leader and their gang
gains the following Benefits and Drawbacks:

- Clanless Underhive Outcasts gangs do not suffer any
  ill effects from being either Law Abiding or Outlaw. In
  effect, these states have no meaning for them, and
  they can freely choose options available to either,
  such as hiring Outlaw or Law Abiding Hired Guns,
  while rival gangs gain no extra credits for selling them
  to Guilders.
- Clanless Underhive Outcasts gangs gain no additional
  options for purchasing weapons or Wargear.
- Clanless Underhive Outcasts gangs are universally
  distrusted, and as such can never form Alliances.

#### Clan House

_Many outcast leaders were once members of a Clan House, but have since fallen out of favour with their old masters. Being a former member of a clan comes with many benefits, such as access to restricted House tech or specialised training. It also makes certain alliances easier, as even a fallen member of a clan is still considered trustworthy by many who hold the clan in high esteem. Of course, with clan affiliation comes drawbacks, the most notable of which is all the clan’s enemies remain your enemies._

A Clan House Underhive Outcasts Leader and their gang
gains the following Benefits and Drawbacks:

- When a Clan House Underhive Outcasts gang
  is created, you must choose one of the six Clan
  Houses for them to affiliate with: Cawdor, Delaque,
  Escher, Goliath, Van Saar or Orlock. For any scenario
  or campaign purposes, the Underhive Outcasts
  gang is considered to be a Clan House gang of the
  chosen type.
- Clan House Underhive Outcasts gangs may purchase
  weapons and Wargear normally restricted to their
  House Lists – including Exotic Beasts – during both
  gang creation and Campaign play.
- Clan House Underhive Outcasts gangs can only enter
  into Alliances with factions their Clan House would
  normally form a Strong Alliance with. Note, they do not
  benefit from having a Strong Alliance with them.

#### Merchant Guild

_It is rare for members of the Merchant Guild to go rogue and become underhive outcasts, though it does still happen more often than the Imperial House would like to admit. A former member of one of the infamous Mercators of Necromunda can make for a formidable gang leader, and they often have a host of specialised equipment and weaponry at their disposal. Furthermore, the ties that bind the Merchant Guild are strong, and even an outcast Guilder can call upon considerable aid should they ask for it._

A Merchant Guild Underhive Outcasts Leader and their
gang gains the following Benefits and Drawbacks:

- When creating a Merchant Guild Underhive Outcasts
  gang, you must choose one of the following Guilds to
  affiliate with: Guild of Coin, Iron Guild, Corpse Guild,
  Water Guild, Promethium Guild or Slave Guild. For
  any scenario or campaign purposes, the Underhive
  Outcasts gang is considered to be a Guild of the
  chosen type.
- Merchant Guild Underhive Outcasts gangs may
  purchase any weapons and Wargear that members of
  their chosen Guild Delegation are equipped with from
  the Trading Post during gang creation and Campaign
  play regardless of Rarity or Legality.
- Merchant Guild Underhive Outcasts gangs can buy
  Cult Icons for 40 credits.
- Merchant Guild Underhive Outcasts gangs can only
  enter into an Alliance with their chosen Guild.

#### Criminal Organisation

_Criminals are a natural fit for underhive outcasts gangs, their nefarious tendencies lending themselves to rejecting the constraints of Necromundan society. Hive scum will flock to the banner of a powerful criminal underhive outcast leader, the lure of easy creds a potent one, while the criminal’s connections mean they can expect greater access to illegal firepower. As with the Guilds, some criminal organisations on Necromunda stick together, and a criminal underhive outcast leader can expect help from their former partners in crime._

A Criminal Underhive Outcasts Leader and their gang gains the following Benefits and Drawbacks:

- When creating a Criminal Underhive Outcasts
  gang, you must choose one Criminal Organisation
  to affiliate with: Cold Traders, Imperial Imposters,
  Rogue Factoria, Narco Lords, Fallen Houses or Psi-
  Syndica. For any scenario or campaign purposes,
  the Underhive Outcasts gang is considered to be a
  Criminal Organisation of the chosen type.
- Criminal Underhive Outcasts gangs may purchase
  any weapons and Wargear that members from
  their chosen Criminal Organisation Delegation are
  equipped with from the Trading Post during gang
  creation and Campaign play, regardless of Rarity
  or Legality.
- Criminal Underhive Outcasts gangs can only enter into
  an Alliance with their chosen Criminal Organisation.

#### Noble House

_When a noble rejects a pampered life in the spire, there is usually a very good reason behind it. As rare as outcast Guilders are, noble outcasts are even rarer, though almost without exception they are talented and determined men and women who share a universal hatred of their own kind. Outcast nobles often take their resources with them when they fall and their gangs are well-funded and equipped. Other organisations on Necromunda are rightly wary of their motivations, however, and their alliances can be erratic at best._

A Noble House Underhive Outcasts Leader and their
gang gains the following Benefits and Drawbacks:

- When creating a Noble House Underhive Outcasts
  gang you must choose one Noble House to affiliate
  with: Catallus, Ty, Ulanti, Greim, Ran Lo or Ko’Iron. For
  any scenario or campaign purposes, the Underhive
  Outcasts gang is considered to be a Noble House of
  the chosen type.
- Noble House Underhive Outcasts gangs may
  purchase weapons and Wargear that members from
  their chosen Noble House Delegation are equipped
  with from the Trading Post during gang creation and
  Campaign play, regardless of Rarity or Legality.
- Noble House Underhive Outcasts gangs can enter
  into an Alliance with any Noble House except for their
  chosen House.

### Archetypes (Skill Sets)

Every Underhive Outcasts Leader has different strengths and weaknesses. Some are brutal overlords who rule through physical strength and crush all in their path; others are more cunning, manipulating those around them to do their bidding; others still can call upon the powers of the Warp to keep their gang in line. Archetypes allow you to further customise your Underhive Outcasts Leader by giving them access to different skill sets. In addition to influencing the kind of Leader the Underhive Outcast is, an Archetype will also influence the Leader’s gang, passing on their favoured tactics to those who follow them.

There are five different kinds of Archetypes: Brawler, Gunslinger, Survivor, Mastermind and Wyrd. When an
Underhive Outcasts Leader or Champion is recruited to an Underhive Outcasts gang they must choose one of these Archetypes, and it may not be changed later on.

#### Brawler

_Brawlers are brutes who rule through physical violence and being bigger than anyone else around. While a brawler can still be smart – after all, it takes more than brawn alone to survive in the underhive – they like to settle their problems personally, usually with the sharp end of a melee weapon, or better yet their fists._

#### Gunslinger

_In the underhive, there are as many gunslingers as there are guns, but only the truly talented live long enough to make a name for themselves. Much like a brawler, a gunslinger is a leader by virtue of their combat prowess. Whereas the brawler uses their brawn, the gunslinger relies on more sophisticated means of dishing out violence._

#### Survivor

_A survivor is a leader who has, against the odds, risen to power. They might have once been a humble ganger or champion, perhaps they have even run with multiple underhive outcasts gangs in their time. The true talent of the survivor is not their skill with a blade or pistol, but knowing when it’s time to cut their losses and head for the badzones._

#### Mastermind

_The mastermind is a cunning manipulator of men and women, and has risen to power through the careful use of alliances and patsies. A mastermind seldom does their own dirty work, preferring to hang back and let their minions sell their lives to advance their agendas; it is a measure of their talent that there always seems to be more scum willing to follow them._

#### Mutant

_Mutants are misshapen outcasts who have fled a life of slavery or abuse to eke out an existence in the deepest parts of the underhive. Mutants who rise to lead gangs of Outcasts are often the toughest of their kind, ‘blessed’ with a variety of advantageous and terrifying mutations._

In addition, Mutants can also choose [Outcast Mutations](outcast-mutations.md) in place of skills. Furthermore, if the Leader of an Underhive Outcasts gang has the Mutant Archetype, then Outcast Mutations will also be available to Underhive Outcasts Hive Scum in their gang.

**Mutant Affiliations**

Mutants are trusted even less than most underhive scum, being somewhere below outlaws but slightly above Chaos worshippers in the eyes of the Clan and Noble Houses. For this reason, an Underhive Outcasts Leader that takes the Mutant Archetype can only have the Clanless Affiliation.

#### Wyrd

_Mutants and psykers are reviled on Necromunda and often cast to the fringes of society. The wyrd leader is one such dispossessed individual, and their gang is often filled with similar kinds of outcasts. An underhive outcasts gang led by a wyrd can be a truly terrible thing, and whole levels of a hive have burned to root these dangerous individuals out._

**Skills:** 1 Primary (custom).  
**Restrictions:** None. Choose any Common and Rare equipment up to Rare (9) from the Trading Post.  
**Special Rules:** Gang Leader, Gang Hierarchy (Leader), Tools of the Trade, Groups Activation (2).

<details>
<summary>Special Rules</summary>

**Gang Leader:** An Underhive Outcasts gang must always include a single fighter with this special rule:

- A fighter with this special rule may not retire during Campaign play. For a gang leader, the only way out is death.
- Should this fighter die during the course of a campaign, the gang disperses and a new gang must be founded (see ‘Death of an Underhive Outcasts Leader’ on page 17).

**Gang Hierarchy (Leader):** During a battle, once this fighter’s gang has failed a Bottle test, during any End phase in which this fighter passes its Cool check and does not flee the battlefield, any friendly Underhive Outcasts fighters that are within 12" of this fighter will automatically pass their Cool check and will not flee the battlefield.

Additionally, during Campaign play, this fighter may perform post-battle actions.

**Tools of the Trade:** This fighter enjoys access to a wide variety of weapons. A fighter
with this special rule may take multiple equipment sets.

**Group Activation (2):** When a fighter with this special rule is activated, their
controlling player can choose to activate a number of additional Ready friendly
Underhive Outcasts fighters equal to the number shown in brackets that are within 3"
of this fighter as part of a ‘Group Activation’:

- The controlling player must nominate all of the fighters who will be activated in this way before any of them are activated.
- Once all participants of the Group Activation have been nominated, the controlling player selects one and activates them as normal, fully resolving their activation before selecting and activating the next. Each fighter activates individually; groups do not activate simultaneously.
- Additional fighters with this special rule activated in this way may not use this special rule themselves.

**Skills:** When recruited, an Underhive Outcasts Leader may choose one skill from their
Primary skill sets (as described in the Necromunda Rulebook). This skill does not cost
any XP and does not increase the fighter’s Credits value.

Underhive Outcasts Leaders may purchase weapons and Wargear from the Trading Post, **limited to items with Rarity ratings of 9** or less (note that the Underhive Outcasts Leader’s Affiliation might open up additional weapon and Wargear options):

- During the course of a campaign, an Underhive Outcasts Leader may be given additional weapons and Wargear purchased from the Trading Post and from the Black Market.
- An Underhive Outcasts Leader has **no restrictions** upon the types of weapon they can take; all weapon types are available.

_There is no single mould from which an Outcasts Leader is cast, each as individual as the hive cities of Necromunda. No matter their origins, allies or motivations, all Outcasts Leaders have one thing in common – a desire to shake off the restraints of Necromundan society and forge their own path, free of the rule of House and Hive. No easy task, this usually makes Outcasts Leaders profoundly dangerous individuals; even without a gang of hive scum to back them up, each is more than capable of handling anything their old masters might throw at them._

### Champion

| 5”  | 3+  | 4+  |  3  |  3  |  2  | 4+  |  1  | 6+  | 7+  | 8+  | 8+  |

**Skills:** 1 Primary (custom).  
**Restrictions:** None. Choose any Common and Rare equipment up to Rare (8) from the Trading Post.  
**Special Rules:** Gang Heirarchy (Champion), Tools of the Trade, Group Activation (1).

<details>
<summary>Special Rules</summary>

**Gang Hierarchy (Champion):** During a battle, once this fighter’s gang has failed a
Bottle test, during any End phase in which this fighter passes its Cool check and does
not flee the battlefield, any friendly Underhive Outcasts fighters that are within 6" of
this fighter will automatically pass their Cool check and will not flee the battlefield.
Additionally, during Campaign play, this fighter may perform post-battle actions.

**Tools of the Trade:** This fighter enjoys access to a wide variety of weapons. A fighter
with this special rule may take multiple equipment sets.

**Group Activation (1):** When a fighter with this special rule is activated, their controlling player can choose to activate a number of additional Ready friendly Underhive Outcasts fighters equal to the number shown in brackets that are within 3" of this fighter as part of a ‘Group Activation’:

- The controlling player must nominate all of the fighters who will be activated in this way before any of them is activated.
- Once all participants of the Group Activation have been nominated, the controlling player selects one and activates them as normal, fully resolving their activation before selecting and activating the next. Each fighter activates individually; groups do not activate simultaneously.

Additional fighters with this special rule activated in this way may not themselves use
this special rule during this activation.

**Archetype:** When recruited, an Underhive Outcasts Champion must select an Archetype; this will determine which skill sets they have access to.

**Skills:** When recruited, an Underhive Outcasts Champion may choose one skill from
their Primary skill sets (as described in the Necromunda Rulebook). This skill does not
cost any XP and does not increase the fighter’s Credits value.

**Wyrd Powers:** If the Underhive Outcasts Champion has the Wyrd Archetype then they
can choose Wyrd Powers in place of skills (see Wyrd Powers on page 52) and gains
the Non-sanctioned Psyker special rule.
