# Venators (Bounty Hunters)

_The underhive is infested with criminals, killers, deviants and worse – making it a rich hunting ground for the so-called Venator bands – temporary coalitions of normally solitary Bounty Hunters._

_All across Necromunda, from the drudging halls of manufactorums and precinct blockhouse walls, to the rusting gates of downhive settlements and cross-tunnel gibbets, images of the faces of wanted individuals flutter in the stale breeze of the carbon scrubbers. A group of talented murderers can make a healthy living collecting the bounties of these criminals, killers and deviants._

_The motley bands of hired guns who go after these bounties are commonly known as Venators, after the ancient High Gothic name for a hunting party; a temporary coalition of Bounty Hunters out for blood and coin. With the promise of shared rewards and extra firepower, Venators form into gangs and pursue Merchants Guild patronage and the stability that comes from regular contracts. Drawn from every Clan or House on Necromunda, Venators come in all shapes and sizes – mixing ex-Goliath heavies and nimble Escher assassins, alongside disgraced watchmen or embittered outcast nobles. Most of them are sanctioned by the Guilders or the Imperial House itself, and carry a hunter’s oath-token as proof of their patronage. However, many are not, though the Guilders often pay for the gang’s captives and kills all the same. In the underhive, lawmen don’t ask too many questions if a masked killer dumps the corpse of a wanted ganger at their feet – they hand over the scrip and sleep a little sounder with one less criminal at large._

- The Leader’s House Legacy determines what House the gang counts as for the purposes claiming Gang Specific Bonuses from Resources. If the Leader has no House Legacy, no Gang Specific Bonus may be claimed.
- Automatically sell captured enemy fighters that are not rescued to the Guilders. Earn full value rather than the usual half.
- When an enemy fighter dies, (either during the battle or during post-battle sequence), claim half of that fighter’s value rounded up to the nearest 5 credits.
- Can hire Hive Scum and Dramatis Personae (Special Characters), but not regular Bounty Hunters.
- Can hire generic Hangers-on and Brutes not associated with any specific House.
