# Sludge Barge

_The spider hunting ships of the sump are known by many names – spiderhaulers, bilgerunners and harpooners to name but a few. Collectively, these purpose-built vessels are known as Sludge Barges, encompassing the myriad boats, ships and scows created in places like Sump City to ply the midnight seas in the pursuit of the precious diamond-like eyes of giant sump spiders._
