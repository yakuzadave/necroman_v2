# Resurrection Packages

_Source: Necromunda: Apocrypha Necromunda (2024)_

Life is cheap on Necromunda and death is always waiting just around the corner – usually with a renderizer in
its meaty fists. But, occasionally, dead isn’t dead, and when a ganger buys it, sometimes, just sometimes, they
come back. For whatever reason, be it unfinished business, xenos tech, or warp sorcery, the ganger has clawed
their way out of the grave and returned to their gang. Of course, no one comes back from the beyond without
paying a price and none return quite the same as before.

Resurrection Packages are a set of optional campaign rules for Arbitrators to introduce into their campaigns.
They give players an opportunity to bring valued fighters back from the dead and return them to the ranks
of their gang – but at a cost. In addition to giving the fighter a second chance – especially if they have died
ignominiously, perhaps even in their first battle – Resurrection Packages are great storytelling tools for the
Arbitrator, and with a little bit of work, entire campaigns can be built around them.

## Using Resurrection Packages

Resurrection Packages are a tool for the Arbitrator,
and can be used whenever a fighter is killed (i.e., they
roll a Memorable Death result on the Lasting Injuries
table, or die because of an untreated Critical Injury).
As a general rule, Resurrection Packages should
be reserved for important fighters, such as gang
Leaders and Champions. When the chosen Leader
or Champion dies, the player can ask the Arbitrator if
they can use a Resurrection Package, or the Arbitrator
can offer the player a chance to bring them back.
Either the Arbitrator or player then chooses what kind
of resurrection has taken place and its effects are
applied to the fighter. In all cases, the fighter is then
restored to life and returned to the player’s gang roster
ready for the next battle, just as if they had rolled an
Out Cold result on the Lasting Injury table.

Unless the Arbitrator has a particular kind of campaign
in mind, it is recommended that each player only ever
have one fighter with a Resurrection Package at a time,
and that each fighter only uses the option once. If one
player in the campaign has access to Resurrection
Packages, then all players should. Coming back from
the dead, of course, is not without its consequences,
and each Resurrection Package includes three special
rules: the Benefits, the Price, and the End Game.

### Benefits

Being resurrected by alien technology, warp energy or
the neuron plague has its benefits. While the fighter
might be changed in some irrevocable way, it does
mean they are probably tougher, more frightening, or
gifted with new and potent abilities. Each Resurrection
Package bestows upon the fighter one or more
Benefits, and they will be listed in this section.

### Price

Returning from the grave always comes at a cost.
The fighter might owe a powerful organisation a debt
that can only be repaid in blood, or perhaps their
body is no longer their own, their flesh slowly being
consumed by ancient archeotech or a hungering warp
entity. Each Resurrection Package comes with a Price
that must be paid, and it will be listed in this section.

### End Game

Resurrection is, at best, a temporary method of
staving off the cold embrace of death. A fighter that
comes back from the dead does so for a reason, and
it is a reason that cannot be ignored. Whether it is
getting revenge on their killer, spreading a zombie
virus or sacrificing captives to the Dark Gods, each
Resurrection Package has its own End Game and it will
be listed in this section.

## A Debt of Blood

There are few things that create loyalty like the gift of
unexpected life. The moment when a soul believes they
will plunge into the abyss but then finds themselves
still hanging by a thread, is a moment that the powerful
can use to forge servants who will be loyal for the
rest of their lives. For some, it is a gunshot that they
thought would end their life, but instead saw their killer
dead at the hands of an angel with a smile and an
offer. For others, it is the chirurgeon with silver-bladed
fingers who saves them and then moves aside to let
their benefactor lay out the terms of this good fortune.
No matter what, a debt of blood is a path back to a life
lived at the end of a string.

**Benefits:** When this Resurrection Package is chosen,
the Arbitrator or the player must choose a Criminal,
Guild or Noble ally. The fighter’s gang immediately
enters into an Alliance with the chosen faction,
forsaking all other allies. While the resurrected fighter
is alive, the gang will always be allied to the chosen
faction. In addition, extra fighters gained from the allies
(e.g., Guild representatives or Criminal allies, etc.)
ignore the A Band Apart rules, and so count as part of
the fighter’s gang, can gain XP (using the gang’s Skill
tables for skills and Advancements) and suffer Lasting
Injuries. Note that, if they die, they are not replaced.

**Price:** The fighter’s gang must change their alignment
to match that of their new allies (i.e., if they were a Law
Abiding gang and a Criminal alliance was made, they
must become an Outlaw gang). In addition,
the fighter’s gang can never voluntarily Test the
Alliance with their new allies.

**End Game:** The cost levied by the allies is always a
hefty one. After each battle the fighter’s gang wins, the
fighter must either hand themselves over to their allies,
or give up a gang member (not including
Hired Guns or fighters gained through their allies). The
chosen fighter is removed from the gang roster. This
continues until this fighter surrenders to their allies, at
which point the Alliance is broken.

## Archeo-Rebirth

There are secrets that are best left in the past, secrets
of iron and the turning wheel that belong to a long
forgotten part of Mankind’s history. Once, there were
machines that could ape the thoughts of humans,
devices that could unravel matter and even halt the
rotation of life into death. Such secrets exist now in
only the most shunned scraps of techno-mythos. But
down in the depths of Necromunda, where the past still
dreams in the underworld, it is said that the machine
spectres of bio-ferrum infusion, nerve tendril merger
and Sarcosan wave generators can still be found.

**Benefits:** A living piece of abominable technology has
affixed itself to the fighter’s body, burrowing mechatendrils
deep inside their flesh. If the wearer suffers
a Lasting Injury result of Humiliated, Head Injury, Eye
Injury, Hand Injury, Hobbled, Spinal Injury or Enfeebled,
they count the result as Out Cold instead. Each time
the fighter avoids a Lasting Injury in
this way, make a note of it.

**Price:** Whatever esoteric technology is keeping the
fighter alive, it has also burrowed its way into their
brain. Whenever the fighter activates, they must roll
a D6. If the result is equal to or less than the total
number of times they have avoided a Lasting Injury
(see Benefits), they gain the Insane Condition.

**End Game:** Eventually, the fighter will become more machine than human. If the fighter has ever avoided 6 Lasting Injuries since taking this Resurrection Package (see Benefits), they vanish into the underhive never to be seen again, and the player must remove them from their gang roster.

## Daemonic Possession

Beyond the veil of reality, Daemons swim in the great
ocean of emotion and nightmare that is the Warp. Ever
hungry for souls and the promise of reality, they seek
for ways into the world of the living. Drawn to mortals,
like an insect to a candle flame, the Daemon can use
the moment of death to slide into a body, consuming
the last shreds of soul as it does, like a hatchling
feeding on the yolk of its egg. Such a possession
cannot last, for the Daemon’s grip on dead flesh is
weak, but while it does, they may walk in the realm of
the living and sate their hunger for suffering and death.

**Benefits:** There is a supernatural horror that emanates
from the fighter, infecting all around them. The fighter
gains the Fearsome skill if they do not have it, and
enemy fighters must pass a Cool test to target them
with ranged weapons. In addition, they gain the Nonsanctioned
Psyker special rule and may generate a
random Wyrd Power from the Helot Chaos Cult Wyrd
Powers list (see Necromunda: The Book of Ruin).

**Price:** The Daemon within the fighter demands
souls if it is to get stronger. For as long as the fighter
remains with the gang, during each post-battle
sequence (whether the fighter was part of the player’s
crew or not), the fighter decreases their Toughness
characteristic by one, unless they performed a Coup de
Grace action during the battle, or the player sacrifices
one of their other fighters (a sacrificed fighter is killed
just as if they had rolled a Memorable Death result on
the Lasting Injury table). If the fighter’s Toughness ever
reaches 0, they are dead for good!

**End Game:** Once the Daemon has consumed its
fill, it will no longer need the fighter, breaking free of
the weak mortal vessel. Each time the fighter takes
a soul (i.e., performs a Coup de Grace action or a
friendly fighter is sacrificed), make a note. In the
post-battle sequence, before deciding whether or not
to sacrifice a friendly fighter (see Price), roll 2D6. If the
result is equal to or lower than the number of souls the
fighter has consumed, they are immediately killed as
the Daemon breaks free!

## Dark Pact

There are things that listen to the dreams and fears
of mortals, things that live past the shadow line that
separates reality from that which lies beyond. Some
call these things gods, others call them Daemons. In
the depths of Hive Primus, there are those that whisper
of the Seven Pale Spinners, the Burning Ones, the
Lord of Skin and Sinew, and the Horned Darkness. No
matter their name, or why mortals call to them, there is
one truth – they listen. And should a lost soul desire to
live beyond their allotted span, the Daemons and gods
can grant that last wish… for a price.

**Benefits:** The fighter may perform a Dark Ritual during
the post-battle sequence, just as if they were part of
a Helot Chaos Cult gang (see Necromunda: The Book
of Ruin). If the fighter is already part of a Helot Chaos
Cult gang then they may add 2 to the dice roll when
performing Dark Rituals. In addition, they gain the
Non-sanctioned Psyker special rule and may generate
a random Wyrd Power from the Helot Chaos Cult Wyrd
Powers list.

**Price:** The fighter’s gang cannot sell Captives to the
Guilders, and must instead sacrifice them to the Dark
Gods, just as if they were a Helot Chaos Cult gang.
If they are already part of a Helot Chaos Cult gang
then this has no extra effects. In addition, the sinister
reputation of the fighter has gotten around and the
gang becomes an Outlaw gang.

**End Game:** It is the will of the Dark Gods to bestow
terrible gifts upon their servant. Once the fighter’s gang
has sacrificed three captives to the Ruinous Powers,
the fighter is transformed into a Chaos Spawn and may
be retained by the gang, whether or not the gang is a
Helot Chaos Cult gang.

## Ravenous Zombie

The dead do not rest easy in the underhives of
Necromunda. Zombie plagues have spread and
multiplied. From the Widow Walkers of Hive Primus and
Hive Quartus, the Rattle Shrouds of the wastes,
to the Pox Walkers that have all but overwhelmed Hive
Mortis, all are hungering undead, driven to spread their
curse to others. Such a fate is only to be feared, but
a few desperate fighters might even seek to taint the
flesh of a dying comrade so that they may walk again.

**Benefits:** The fighter cannot be pinned, ignores Flesh
Wounds and automatically passes any Cool tests they
are required to take. In addition, while weapons with
the Blaze trait can set them on fire, while they are on
fire they only suffer the additional damage component
of the Blaze rule, and may otherwise act normally.

**Price:** The fighter becomes a zombie (see Zombies! as follows).

**End Game:** The fighter is inexorably driven to create
more zombies. After each battle, one randomly
determined fighter in the player’s gang becomes a
zombie (see Zombies! as follows). Once a fighter is a
zombie, they cannot be deleted from the gang roster
during the post-battle sequence. Once every fighter in
the gang is a zombie, it is disbanded as they wander
off into the underhive looking for fresh meat…

:::info

### Zombies!

Zombies in Necromunda are an all too common occurrence, each infestation created in its own unique way, though they all share certain traits.
While a fighter is a zombie, they may only ever take a single action in each of their activations, suffer a -4 to the hit roll with all weapons that do
not have the Melee or Versatile trait, treat the Charge (Double) action as a Basic action, and must perform the Charge (Basic) action or Coup de Grace (Simple) action, if able. They also cannot perform Group Activations with fighters who are not also zombies.

:::

## Revenant

Revenge is a power that can deny the dead the peace
of the grave. Driven by immortal hate, the revenant is a
figure who lives again to perform one deed alone – to
pull those who wronged them into death with them.

**Benefits:** When this Resurrection Package is chosen,
make a note of the enemy fighter responsible for the
resurrected fighter’s death. If the resurrected fighter
wasn’t killed by an enemy fighter (e.g., they fell to their
death, etc.,), then choose the Leader of the enemy
gang the resurrected fighter was facing when they died.
Whenever the resurrected fighter faces this chosen
enemy, they may re-roll failed to hit and to wound
rolls, as well as the Injury dice, when making attacks
against them.

**Price:** The fighter must try to kill their killer. Each time
their gang doesn’t face the enemy’s gang in a battle
(whether or not the chosen enemy is part of their
opponent’s crew), they must roll a D6. On a 4+,
their Strength characteristic is reduced by one. If they
are reduced to 0 Strength, they die and are removed
from the gang roster.

**End Game:** If the fighter ever kills their enemy
(rolls a Memorable Death result on the Lasting Injury
table, or sends them to the Doc and they are not
saved), the fighter retires, and is removed from the
gang roster. If their enemy is killed by someone else, or
retires, they must choose a new fighter from the enemy
fighter’s gang – this new fighter becomes their chosen
enemy.

## Skindeep Doppelgänger

The faces of the dead are a mask that can be worn
by the living. Remorphic aliens, witch-bred assassins,
neuro-mimic cultists and other shape changers may
take the death of an individual as an opportunity to slip
into the space left by the departed, wearing their face
and life like a set of clothes while they pursue their
own ends.

**Benefits:** The fighter is not quite the same. When they
are resurrected, the fighter may alter any skill advances
they have received. They remove all their existing skills
and choose an equal number of new skills. When
choosing skills, including their starting skill for being
a Leader or Champion, they may choose from any skill
category and not just those available to their gang or
fighter type.

**Price:** Other members of the gang are a little unnerved
by the Doppelgänger. The fighter cannot make or
participate in Group Activations, nor can they use or
benefit from the Leading by Example rule.

**End Game:** The fighter is following its own secret
agenda. At the end of each battle, the fighter takes
part in, roll 3D6. If a double is rolled, the fighter
disappears for a battle (effectively going Into
Recovery). If a triple is rolled, they vanish entirely and
are removed from the gang’s roster.

## Xenos Resurrection

There are creatures who walked the stars when
Mankind was less than a dream in the eye of ancient
gods. To such beings, death is a puzzle long solved,
and a gift that now tempts humanity. From the Halo
Devices brought from the planets Calixis and dread
Mandragora to the flesh mastery of the Drukhari
Haemonculi and the metallic Solar Worms found in the
black sands of dead worlds, there are many ways back
from death open to those who are willing to leave their
humanity behind.

**Benefits:** The fighter is not entirely human anymore.
Each time the fighter suffers a Lasting Injury, the
fighter counts the effect as Out Cold unless a
Memorable Death or a Critical Injury was generated.
When the fighter avoids the effects of a Lasting Injury
in this way, however, the player must make a note.

**Price:** Each time the fighter avoids a Lasting Injury,
they permanently become more alien. All effects
are cumulative. If they have survived one Lasting
Injury, they cannot use or benefit from the Leading by
Example rule. If they have survived two Lasting Injuries,
they cannot make or take part in Group Activations.
If they have survived three Lasting Injuries, they
cannot be the target of friendly gang tactics. Finally, if
they have survived four or more Lasting Injuries then
friendly fighters may never voluntarily be deployed or
move within 3" of the fighter.

**End Game:** Eventually, the fighter’s humanity is
consumed by the alien within and they become
something else entirely. Once the fighter has ignored
the effect of four or more Lasting Injuries since taking
the Resurrection Package, each time they would suffer
the effect of a new Lasting Injury they must roll 2D6.
If the result of the dice roll is equal to or lower than
the current number of Lasting Injuries, they have
ignored the effects of, they immediately transform into
a Beast’s Lair (or a creature chosen by the Arbitrator),
and will always move towards and attempt to attack
the nearest fighter on their activation if they are a
creature. After the battle, permanently remove the
fighter from the gang roster.

## The Stranger’s Gift

Sometimes, just when they are needed, a stranger
appears, bearing the solution to an impossible
problem. Even when on death’s door, the wise do not
accept such gifts of resurrection lightly, for some fates
are far worse than death. However, in the depths
of the underhive, the wise are hard to come by,
while eager fools are everywhere.

**Benefits:** The fighter has been brought back for a
specific purpose, part of which includes getting some
potent firepower to get the job done. They may
choose up to 250 credits worth of weapons and
Wargear from either the Trading Post or Black Market,
ignoring restrictions for Rarity and Illegality.

**Price:** The fighter is pursuing their own agenda now,
but may help out their old gang, and will do so on the
cheap… for old times’ sake. They become a Bounty
Hunter who will only work for their old gang,
but must be hired if their player wants to include them
in a crew. However, they may be hired for half their total
cost in credits (rounded up to the nearest 5 credits).

**End Game:** Eventually, the fighter will have to do the
job they were paid for. After each battle the fighter
took part in, roll a D6. If the result is less than the
number of enemies Seriously Injured or taken Out of
Action by the fighter during the battle, the player must
immediately pay credits equal to the fighter’s hiring fee,
or permanently remove them from their gang roster.

## Divine Intervention

Miracles abound across the Imperium, if the rhetoric
of the Ministorum is to be believed, and the Imperial
Creed is built upon a belief in the divine power of the
God-Emperor and his power to protect his people. True
miracles are seldom seen, and it can be difficult to tell
the hand of the Emperor at work from more nefarious
powers, especially in the shadowy depths of the
underhive where the price of faith is often an eternity
of servitude.

**Benefits:** The fighter has been restored to life by a
miracle. Others see the hand of the God-Emperor at
work in them, and it rightly makes them fearful while
some divine hand does seem to protect them from the
powers of the Warp. The fighter gains the Fearsome
skill if they did not already have it, and a special 2+
Save against any Wyrd Power that targets them.

**Price:** The fighter hears the voice of the God-Emperor
in their dreams and is driven to do his bidding. If there
is a fighter with the Non-sanctioned Psyker special rule,
or their gang is facing a Helot Chaos Cult, Genestealer
Cult, Corpse Grinder Cult or a Chaos Corrupted or
Genestealer Corrupted gang, they must seek out and
take out of action the Non-sanctioned Psyker or the
most powerful fighter (i.e., the highest credit cost)
in the opposing gang. If they fail to do so before the
end of the battle, they feel they have failed the God-
Emperor, fall into a deep depression and must go
Into Recovery.

**End Game:** Eventually, the fighter will be called away
to serve the God-Emperor or taken by the Ministorum
for ‘testing’. At the end of each campaign cycle, they
must roll 2D6. If the result is equal to or lower than
the number of battles they have fought in since their
divine intervention, they must make a Willpower test.
If this test is failed, they must be removed from the
gang roster.
