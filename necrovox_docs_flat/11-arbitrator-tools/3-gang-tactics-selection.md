# Gang Tactics Selection

_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

There are a dizzying array of gang tactics available for use by the various gangs of Necromunda and working out which ones are available to players can be a daunting task. Presented here are rules for generating Gang Tactics Pools. Note that if using Underdog Gang Tactics (see page 240) each gang will need a separate Gang Tactics Pool for them, the two Gang Tactics Pools do not have to be generated in the same manner.

## Preset Method

Many supplements contain tables of gang tactics
available for gangs to use, the easiest method is for
each gang to choose one of these tables and generate
all of their gang tactics from the one table.

## Custom Method

This is the standard method for determining the
Gang Tactics Pool and allows players to tailor the
gang tactics available to them. At gang creation, players select 18 gang tactics that are either specific
to their gang or available to any gang with the
following restrictions:

- Unless specifically stated otherwise, no more
  than one gang tactic with the same name may be
  included in the pool.
  - If there are multiple gang tactics with the same
    name, use the most recent version.
- Gang tactics that require either vehicles or Wargear
  that grants the Mounted condition in order to be
  played can only be included if the campaign includes
  Ash Wastes battles.

Write the names, triggers and benefits of the gang
tactics chosen on the table provided opposite. Gang
tactics can be randomly determined by rolling a D66
(taking care to keep the roll a secret) and referring to
the table. If a gang tactic is generated that can not
be used in the scenario (for example it requires an
enemy vehicle and the opposing starting Crew and
Reinforcement deck does not include any vehicles)
then a new gang tactic can be generated to replace it.

In the Update Gang Rating step of the
post-battle sequence, up to two gang tactics may be
swapped out for different gang tactics.

## Limited Method

This method makes gang tactics a limited resource
where players must choose the time of biggest impact
to play their gang tactics in. This method works best
when using the Gang Tactics cards available from the
Games Workshop webstore.

At gang creation each player builds a deck of up to
30 gang tactics cards from those available to them
following the same restrictions as for the Custom
Method. Each time a gang tactic card is played, it is
permanently removed from the Gang Tactics Pool
for the remainder of the campaign. This means that
each gang tactic can only be used once by each gang
throughout the entire campaign and the number of
gang tactics available to each player will dwindle.

## The Goonhammer Way

Have your players build a deck of 12 cards of their choice. For
games with random card selection, just draw (or roll for) X cards
and have at it. For games where the players choose their cards, have
them randomly generate X+1 cards and discard one of their choice.
