# Van Saar Sub-plots

The gangs of House Van Saar operate to protect the interests of the House, ensuring its vast manufactoria
operations are protected from hostile rivals whilst simultaneously keeping the secrets of the House secure fromoutsiders. To do this, Van Saar gangs rely on their technological superiority and the intellectual prowess of handpicked gang leaders to present shows of unrivalled strength through superior tactics and firepower. Where other
gangs rely on brute force or dogged determination to win a fight, House Van Saar prefers to outwit and outgun
its foes.

If players are using Sub-plots in their games (see the Necromunda Rulebook), then a Van Saar player may choose
to use the Van Saar Sub-plots table rather than any of the ones in the rulebook. Unlike the Sub-plots in the
rulebook, Van Saar Sub-plots do not use suits (i.e., any Ace drawn will represent the Retaliatory Fire Sub-plot
regardless of its suit).

|  Ace  | **Retaliatory Fire**<br /> Reveal this Sub-plot if a Champion or Leader belonging to your gang is Seriously Injured or taken Out of Action by an enemy fighter. If, at the end of the Action phase, that enemy fighter is Seriously Injured or taken Out of Action, every fighter in your gang gains 1 XP. If the enemy fighter is not Seriously Injured or taken Out of Action by then, this card is discarded.                                                                    |
|   2   | **Methodical**<br /> Reveal this Sub-plot the first time a Seriously Injured enemy fighter is taken Out of Action by one of your fighters as a result of a Shoot (Basic) action. Your fighter immediately gains an additional 1 XP.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|   3   | **Shooting Gallery**<br /> The first time one of your fighters becomes Engaged by an enemy fighter, discard this Sub-plot.

|   4   | **Forward Thinking**<br /> Reveal this Sub-plot when your opponent plays a gang tactic. If you have yet to play a gang tactic this battle, immediately gain one randomly determined gang tactic. If your opponent has played two or more gang tactics before this Sub-plot is revealed, and you have yet to play any gang tactics, immediately gain two randomly determined gang tactics instead.                                                                                   |
|   5   | **Radiation Purge**<br /> Reveal this Sub-plot the first time an enemy fighter reduces their Toughness characteristic to 0 due to a 4+ being rolled as a result of the Rad-phage trait.

|   9   | **Reliable Tech**<br /> Reveal this Sub-plot during the Choose Crew steps of the pre-battle sequence. For the duration of the battle, only weapons with the Plentiful trait can be used; if a fighter that is part of your crew does not have such a weapon, they count as being equipped with a laspistol until the end of the battle, after which the laspistol is discarded. Should your gang win the scenario, it receives 2D6x10 credits, in addition to any scenario rewards. |
