# Escher Sub-plots

The fighters of House Escher revel in the surgically (and stylishly) applied shock and
awe of battle, dealing as much damage as they can in as short a time as possible
to demoralise and disorientate their enemies. They value skilful kills and daring
attacks, their fighters gaining great renown from their peers for impressive battlefield
feats. Escher fighters are also well known for their use of poisons and chems to take
down their foes, and the Clan Chymists regularly supply gangs with new experimental
toxins to try out in battle.

If players are using sub-plots in their battles (see the Necromunda Rulebook) then an
Escher player may choose to use the Escher Sub-plots table rather than any of the
ones in the rulebook. Unlike the sub-plots in the rulebook, Escher sub-plots do not
use suits (i.e., any Ace drawn will represent the Decapitation sub-plot regardless of
its suit).
