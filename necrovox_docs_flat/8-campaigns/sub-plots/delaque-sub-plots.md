# Delaque Sub-plots

House Delaque gangs excel at spying, sabotage and assassination and, as such, their services are often employed by the Noble Houses or the Imperial House. Whenever a Delaque gang enters battle, its true goal is seldom as simple as
defeating their rivals, rather, there might be numerous other subtle plans in play, many unknown and unseen by the enemy.

If players are using Sub-plots in their games (see the Necromunda Rulebook) then a
Delaque player may choose to use the Delaque Sub-plots table rather than any of the
ones in the rulebook. Unlike the Sub-plots in the rulebook, Delaque Sub-plots do not
use suits (i.e., any Ace drawn will represent the Host of Shadows Sub-plot regardless
of its suit).

| Card  | Sub-plot                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

|  Ace  | **Host of Shadows**<br /> Reveal this Sub-plot at the beginning of a round if you have at least one fighter within 6" of each of the four corners of the battlefield and out of line of sight of any enemy fighters. If, at the end of the round, these fighters are still in place and not Seriously Injured, add D6x10 credits to your gang’s stash.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|   2   | **An Unkind Word**<br /> Reveal this Sub-plot if a Champion or Leader belonging to your gang moves within 1" of an enemy Champion of Leader. Your Champion or Leader may then make the Clever Insult (Basic) action, forcing the enemy Champion or Leader to make an Intelligence check. If the test is failed, your Champion or Leader gains 1 XP. If the Intelligence test is passed, they earn D3 XP instead.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|   3   | **Five Small Secrets**<br /> Reveal this Sub-plot when activating a fighter in your crew. That fighter may immediately make the Hide Device (Basic) action, placing a marker next to their location to indicate a hidden device. Place a token next to the fighter’s card or otherwise indicate that it is active on the fighter. If by the end of the game the fighter did not go Out of Action and placed at least five hidden devices, each at least 6" apart, then add 2D6x10 credits to your gang’s stash.                                                                                                |
|   4   | **Silent Footsteps**<br /> Reveal this Sub-plot if one of your fighters engages an enemy fighter outside of their line of sight, and outside of the line of sight of any enemy fighters. If your fighter has not gone Out of Action by the end of round, immediately add a random gang tactic to your gang for this battle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|   5   | **Eyes in the Dark**<br /> Reveal this Sub-plot if the Pitch Black rules are in effect or come into effect during the course of the battle. If your gang wins the scenario without any of its fighters ever gaining a revealed token (i.e., from firing a weapon, getting set on fire, or otherwise illuminating themselves), all fighters in your gang who took part in the scenario gain D3 XP in addition to any other scenario rewards.                                                                                                                                                                    |
|   6   | **Whispers and Lies**<br /> Reveal this Sub-plot the first time one of your fighters takes the Coup de Grace action. Instead of sending the enemy fighter Out of Action they can instead make the Plant Lie (Simple) action. If, at the end of any round, there are three enemy fighters on the battlefield who have had this action made against them, your gang immediately gains a gang tactic for use later in this battle.                                                                                                                                                                                |
|   7   | **Craven is the Coward**<br /> Reveal this Sub-plot if there are three or more enemy fighters currently Broken, and no friendly fighters within 6" of one of your fighters. If this is the case, add D6x10 credits to your gang’s stash. If all enemy fighters on the battlefield are Broken, add 3D6x10 credits instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|   8   | **Follow the Leader**<br /> Secretly choose an enemy fighter at the start of the game – if the enemy Leader is on the battlefield you must choose them. Reveal this Sub-plot in the End phase if at least one of your fighters is within 6" and line of sight of the chosen fighter. If for three consecutive turns in each End phase you have a friendly fighter within 6" and line of sight of the chosen fighter, discard this card to add 2D6x10 credits to your gang’s stash.                                                                                                                             |
|   9   | **A Dark Mirror**<br /> Reveal this Sub-plot after an enemy fighter completes their activation. One of your fighters within 18" and line of sight of the enemy fighter must then make exactly the same action(s) as the chosen fighter (i.e., move, shoot, charge, etc), though need not use the same weapons or select the same targets of their attacks. In each subsequent round, the fighter must activate after the enemy fighter and copy their actions. If they can do this for three consecutive rounds, they gain D3 XP. If they can keep it up until the end of the battle, they earn D6 XP instead. |
|  10   | **Dead of Night**<br /> At the start of the game, secretly choose a number between 6 and 12. If, when the round number matches the number chosen, no enemy fighters have line of sight to any of your fighters, your gang immediately gains a gang tactic for use later in this battle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Jack  | **No Witnesses**<br /> Reveal this Sub-plot if one of your fighters takes an enemy fighter Out of Action while neither fighter is within line of sight of any other fighters. Place a marker where the enemy fighter went Out of Action (this marker can be moved just like a Loot casket as detailed in the Necromunda Rulebook). If, by the end of the game, no enemy fighters have come within 1" of the marker, add D6x10 credits to your gang’s stash.                                                                                                                                                    |
| Queen | **Hive Ghosts**<br /> Reveal this Sub-plot if one of your fighters recovers from being Seriously Injured and goes on to take an enemy fighter Out of Action. If they do so, they earn D3 XP. If they do this and remain out of line of sight of any enemy fighters for the remainder of the game, they earn D6 XP instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| King  | **Memory Fades to Myth**<br /> Secretly choose one of your fighters at the beginning of the game. Each time an enemy or friendly fighter is Seriously Injured or taken Out of Action within line of sight of the fighter, make a note. If, at the end of the battle, the chosen fighter is still on the battlefield, reveal this Sub-plot. If they witnessed at least three fighters being Seriously Injured or taken Out of Action, add D6x10 credits to your gang’s stash. If they witnessed five or more fighters suffering these fates, add 3D6x10 credits to your gang’s stash instead.                   |
