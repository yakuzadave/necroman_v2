# Cawdor Sub-plots

House Cawdor gangs spread the faith of the Redemption with a fanatical devotion
that has seen the clan expand to almost every hive city on Necromunda. To be a
member of the Redemption means relentlessly pursuing the tenets of the faith –
bringing the down trodden and hopeless into the clan, but also exterminating the
mutant, heretic and unbeliever wherever they may be found.

If players are using sub-plots in their battles (see the Necromunda Rulebook), then a
Cawdor player may choose to use the Cawdor Sub-plots table rather than any of the
ones in the rulebook. Unlike the Sub-plots in the rulebook, Cawdor Sub-plots do not
use suits (i.e., any Ace drawn will represent the Test of Faith Sub-plot regardless of
its suit).

|  Ace  | **Test of Faith**<br /> Reveal this Sub-plot if a Champion or Leader belonging to your gang is Seriously Injured or taken Out of Action by an enemy fighter. If, at the end of the Action phase, that enemy fighter is Seriously Injured or taken Out of Action, every fighter in your gang gains 1 XP. If the enemy fighter is not Seriously Injured or taken Out of Action by then, this card is discarded.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|   2   | **Fires of Redemption**<br /> Reveal this Sub-plot if three or more enemy fighters are subject to the Blaze condition at the same time to immediately gain a single randomly selected Gang Tactic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|   3   | **Folly of the Faithless**<br /> Reveal this Sub-plot at the start of the battle if the enemy’s starting crew contains one or more Psykers. For the duration of this battle, all Psykers in the enemy gang suffer a -1 modifier to their Willpower checks. In addition, for each enemy Psyker taken Out of Action during this battle, your gang gains D3 Reputation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|   4   | **Purge them All!**<br /> Reveal this Sub-plot if at least three enemy fighters are Seriously Injured or taken Out of Action during a single round. Your gang immediately gains two randomly determined Gang Tactics. If the enemy fighters were Seriously Injured or taken Out of Action by weapons with the Blaze trait, your gang immediately gains three randomly determined Gang Tactics instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|   5   | **Hymn of Devotion**<br /> If at the start of any of your activations two or more friendly House Cawdor fighters have made a successful Threshold test this round, reveal this Sub-plot. Every enemy fighter on the battlefield suffers a -1 modifier to any Cool checks they are required to make until the end of this round.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|   6   | **Martyrdom**<br /> Reveal this Sub-plot during the Choose Crew step of the pre-battle sequence. Choose one of the fighters in your crew and tuck this card under their Fighter card or otherwise note that they are the subject of this Sub-plot. For the duration of this battle the chosen fighter counts as having no weapons, armour or Wargear regardless of what appears on their model. If the fighter manages to inflict a Serious Injury or an Out of Action result on an enemy fighter, they earn D3 XP. If, after achieving this feat, the fighter is then taken Out of Action, your gang earns +2D3 Reputation. |
|   7   | **Righteous are the Fallen**<br /> Reveal this Sub-plot if you win the battle with three or fewer friendly fighters Standing and Active. If you do, your gang gains +D3 Reputation. If you won the battle with only a single friendly fighter Standing and Active, your gang gains +2D3 Reputation instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|   8   | **If It Doesn’t Hurt, It Doesn’t Count!**<br /> Reveal this Sub-plot when a friendly House Cawdor Champion or Leader recovers from being Seriously Injured (i.e., rolling a Flesh Wound when making a Recovery test and becoming Prone and Pinned). Your gang gains +D3 Reputation. If the recovered fighter then goes on to recover from being Seriously Injured a second time before the end of the battle, your gang instead earns +2D3 Reputation.                                                                                                                                                                       |
|   9   | **March to the Grave**<br /> Reveal this Sub-plot at the start of any round if your gang has failed a Bottle test and your opponent has at least three times as many fighters on the battlefield as you do. If you subsequently go on to win the battle, your gang gains +D3 Reputation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|  10   | **Rites of Doom**<br /> If at the start of any of your activations two or more of your fighters are Engaged with the same enemy Leader or Champion, you may reveal this Sub-plot. If at the end of the activation that enemy Leader or Champion has been taken Out of Action, your gang gains D3+1 Reputation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Jack  | **Word of the God-Emperor**<br /> Reveal this Sub-plot when a Champion or Leader belonging to your gang uses the Group Activation (X) special rule. Until the start of their next activation, every fighter activated as part of that Group Activation gains a special 3+ save roll against any hits that cannot be modified in any way. In addition, until the start of their next activation, every fighter activated as part of that Group Activation that performs a Coup De Grace (Simple) action earns an additional 1 XP and your gang gains 1 Reputation.                                                            |
| Queen | **Reign of Madness**<br /> Reveal this Sub-plot when an enemy fighter fails a Nerve test. For the remainder of this battle, an enemy fighter that fails a Nerve test does not become Broken. Instead, they become subject to the Insane condition.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| King  | **Divine Possession**<br /> Reveal this Sub-plot when a Champion or Leader belonging to your gang is taken Out of Action by an enemy fighter. The fighter is not taken Out of Action. Instead, they regain one lost Wound and, for the remainder of this battle, improve their Weapon Skill and Strength characteristics by 2 (to a maximum of 2+ and 6 respectively). However, if the fighter is taken Out of Action again during this battle, they are removed from play as normal, two Lasting Injury rolls are made against them and the higher result is applied.                                                       |
