# Rackets

Each Racket has unique bonuses. A gang receives the benefits of a Racket so long as it holds it. Benefits of Rackets
are gained after each battle (including immediately after taking control of it after a battle).

Once the Racket is lost (for example taken by another gang), the bonus is also lost.

There are 2 ways to take control of Rackets:

- Winning a battle with a Racket at stake.
- Racket as exchange for Captives.

## Campaign variations

#### Total Resources

| Campaign      | Amount of Resources                  |
| :------------ | :----------------------------------- |
| Law & Misrule | All (except the starting Resources). |

#### Unique Resources

| Campaign      | Unique Resources | Duplicate Enhanced Bonuses                                                             |
| :------------ | :--------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Law & Misrule | Yes.             | Linked: Receive all duplicate bonuses except Income. Only claim a single Income bonus. |

### Resource Bonuses

All Resources are unique and have different bonuses:

#### Income

Add the amount of credits to the Stash when collecting income from Resources (including any that was won from the previous battle).

#### Recruits

- Free to recruit (does not cost any credits).
- The cost is added to Gang Rating and Wealth.
- Equipment must be purchased separately (unless otherwise specified).
- Hired guns remain with the gang while in control of the Resource.
- Hangers-on can be recruited regardless of Reputation and will not affect the maximum amount of Hangers-on the gang may have.

:::tip YAQ
Once the Resource is lost, the Hangers-on is also lost. The Hangers-on will never leave the gang because of injuries and can't be killed. Note that this means it’s important to distinguish between those that are regular hangers-on and those territory-related (if you control both types and at least one is drafted into a battle).
:::

#### Equipment

- Can be distributed to eligible fighters.
- _Free_ equipment is lost when the Resource is lost.
- Purchased equipment is kept after the Resource is lost.
- The (full) cost is added to Gang Rating and Wealth, even for discounted and free items.

#### Reputation

Increase the Reputation while in control of the Resource. When the Resource is lost, decrease Reputation with the equal amount.

#### Special

If the Resource is lost, so is the benefit.

### Enhanced Bonuses

Some Resources have Enhanced bonuses that require specific criterias to be met in order to claim them.

#### Gang-Specific

Gang Specific bonuses can only be claimed by the specified gang. It will replace generic bonuses of the same type.

#### Linked

Linked bonuses can be claimed by taking control of the specified Resources. They are claimed in addition to any duplicate types of bonuses, except income. Only a single Income bonus can be claimed.
