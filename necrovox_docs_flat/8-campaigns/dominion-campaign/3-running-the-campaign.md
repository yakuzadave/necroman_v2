# Running The Campaign

_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

The Dominion Campaign is broken down into two main parts, divided by a period of Downtime allowing gangs to lick their wounds and consolidate their strength before the final, bloody confrontation is played out. As a guideline, each part runs for three cycles in which battles are played and victories are tallied. At the end of each cycle (as determined by the Arbitrator), the effects of the players’ battles are applied to the campaign.

The Dominion Campaign is divided into three phases, all of which run for a fixed length of real time:

| Phase               | Duration     |
| :------------------ | :----------- |
| 1. Occupation phase | Three cycles |
| 2. Downtime         | One cycle    |
| 3. Takeover phase   | Three cycles |

Each phase is broken down as follows:

## 1. Occupation Phase (3 Cycles)

The first part of the Dominion Campaign follows the
gangs as they try to increase the number of Territories
they control and grow their influence. During this
phase, the following rules apply:

- During the first two campaign cycles of the
  Occupation phase, Ash Wastes battles take place
  during the Season of Ash.
- During the third campaign cycle of the Occupation
  phase, Ash Wastes battles take place during the
  Changing Seasons.
- Only unclaimed Territories may be claimed
  as rewards for gang battles unless there are
  no unclaimed Territories (see Issuing and
  Accepting Challenges).

## 2. Downtime (1 Cycle)

During Downtime, gangs have a chance to recover and regroup, taking the opportunity to re-equip, fix up wounded fighters and repair and upgrade vehicles. Exceptionally bold and active players might put their gangs through a special [side battle](/docs/campaigns/dominion-campaign/running-the-campaign#side-battles) if they just can’t be away from the roar of guns and chainblades for that long.

### The Effects Of Downtime

After their last battle of the Occupation phase, players complete the following steps at the end of the post-battle sequence:

A. Fighters Recover  
B. Captives are Returned  
C. Experienced Juves and Prospects are Promoted  
D. Fresh Recruitment

### A. Fighters Recover

Any In Recovery boxes on the gang roster are cleared.

### B. Captives Are Returned

Any Captured fighters are released. The gang that
had Captured them receives half their credits value
(rounding up to the nearest 5 credits).

### C. Experienced Juves And Prospects Are Promoted

If any gang contains any Juves or Prospects with three
or more Advancements, they may be promoted. Their
characteristics and credits value are unaffected, but
their Type is changed as described in their fighter entry.

### D. Fresh Recruitment

All gangs gain 250 credits to spend on new equipment
from their Gang Equipment List or to recruit new
fighters, vehicles and/or Hangers-on. These credits
must be spent now and cannot be added to the
gang’s Stash. Gangs may supplement these credits
with extra credits from their Stash.

## 3. Takeover Phase (3 Cycles)

The second part of the Dominion Campaign sees
gangs defend their Territories against their rivals, as
well as capture those controlled by other gangs. During
this phase the following rules apply:

- During the first campaign cycle of the Takeover
  phase, Ash Wastes battles take place during the
  Changing Seasons.
- During the second and third campaign cycles of
  the Takeover phase, Ash Wastes battles take place
  during the Season of Flame.
- Only controlled Territories may be fought over and
  claimed as rewards (see [Issuing and Accepting](/docs/campaigns/dominion-campaign/setting-up-the-campaign#issuing-and-accepting-challenges)).

## Winning

Victory in the Dominion Campaign can be measured in
many ways, although simply surviving the fierce inter- gang warfare is an achievement in itself. At the end of the campaign, the Arbitrator awards Triumphs to the
players depending on how their gangs have performed
during the campaign.

The Arbitrator should have a look at the Triumphs at
the start of the Dominion Campaign as some of them
require keeping track of how many enemy models
players have taken Out of Action or vehicles they have
Wrecked, so these will need to be recorded. Likewise, the Arbitrator might like to make the players aware
of the different Triumphs at the beginning of the
campaign so that each player can decide if there is one
or more they wish to try to achieve. Below is a list of the
Dominion Campaign Triumphs:

| Triumph         | Criteria                                                                                |
| :-------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Dominator**   | Most Territories at the end of the campaign.                                            |
| **Slaughterer** | Most enemy fighters taken Out of Action and vehicles Wrecked across the whole campaign. |
| **Creditor**    | Largest Wealth at the end of the campaign.                                              |
| **Warmonger**   | Most battles fought across the whole campaign.                                          |
| **Powerbroker** | Highest Reputation at the end of the campaign.                                          |

### Side Battles

Side battles are special battles fought during
Downtime. While most players will be happy with
taking a break for a week and getting ready for the
Takeover phase, there may be a few who can’t go
a week without their fix of gang warfare. To satisfy
this need, an Arbitrator can run one or more side
battles during Downtime. Side battles are fought
after the effects of Downtime are applied.

Side battles should, as a rule, be unusual and
have no effect on the campaign as a whole. They
are a great opportunity for the Arbitrator to design
a custom scenario, to use the [Arbitrator tools](/docs/category/arbitrator-tools), or to play some of the narrative
scenarios. Models can earn Experience and suffer
Lasting Injuries or Lasting Damage from a side
battle, but should not gain or earn income, or gain
credits or Reputation as a reward for a side battle.
Instead, the Arbitrator should create a special
reward for the victor or victors of a side battle, such as an unpredictable piece of archeotech, a unique chem, or a custom gang tactic.
