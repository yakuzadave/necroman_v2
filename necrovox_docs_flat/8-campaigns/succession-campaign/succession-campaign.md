# Succession Campaign

_In the Succession Campaign you pick a side in the war for control over Necromunda. As the Great Darkness begins, Necromunda’s core cools; the great heat sinks powering and warming the hives grow cold. The whole planet is plunged into darkness and in order to survive, the hive cities and spires cut themselves off completely from the underhive, leaving those below to fend for themselves._

## How the Campaign Works

The Succession Campaign is a complete narrative
campaign that can be used alongside the Necromunda
rules. It incorporates many of the existing Necromunda
and Ash Wastes campaign rules, adding additional
special rules to recreate the turbulent times of the Great
Darkness and the beginning of the rebellion against
Lord Helmawr’s rule. The campaign is divided into two
phases, separated by a period of Downtime: the Great
Darkness phase and the Spark of Rebellion phase.

In the Great Darkness phase, gangs fight to seize and
consolidate whatever powerbase they can in order to
ensure their survival, cut off from their larger Houses
as they are. The usual barriers collapse and gangs are
able to move freely between the underhive and the
ash wastes.

Then in the Spark of Rebellion phase, gangs have to
declare their allegiance in the brewing civil war and
try to claim as much influence as they can for their
chosen side.

Later supplements will continue on from the Succession
Campaign and allow players to keep using the same
gangs in the ongoing struggle to control Necromunda.

### Challenges

Each gang can issue 1 challenge per cycle, 1 more if all battles are fought and there is more time in the cycle.

- First cycle: Randomize challenges for the first battle of the campaign.
- Subsequent cycles: Choose who to challenge. Ascending order of Gang Rating, starting with the gang with the lowest rating (tie-breaker: randomize).
- If a gang receives more than 1 challenge, any challenges after the first can be declined without penalty.
- Rescue scenario (captives): Escape from Hive Zalktraa.

## Controlling Sympathisers

Central to the Succession Campaign is the control
of Sympathisers. At the start of the campaign, each gang is trying to sway as many groups to their cause as they can as a matter of sheer survival; these are represented by a special kind of Territory known as Sympathisers. As the rebellion starts, it becomes ever
more important to amass a large group of supporters and weaken the enemy’s support base. Players will start
with a few Sympathisers already swayed to their cause,
and must prove their worth to others in battle.

### Resources

Generate a random pool of 3 Sympathisers per gang. These are the available Sympathisers for phase 1. The first battle is fought against a random gang with a random Sympathiser at stake. In subsequent battles, challengers can choose Sympathisers at stake as normal.

Sympathisers have a 2 types of boon, one is only active in phase 3, the other is always active (also in phase 3).

## Starting Out

**Starting credits:** 2000  
**Additional Credits for Vehicles and Mounts:** 400  
**Keep unspent credits:** No

In addition, each gang starts with a randomly-determined Sympathiser andaGang Sympathisers Territory

## Phases

### Phase 1: The Great Darkness

After each battle, gangs cannot:

- Re-equip from the Gang Equipment Lists.
- Recruit fighters, crew or hangers-on.
- +4 Rarity for all items from Trading Post & Black Market.

Apply the following to all battles (depending of battlefield type):

- **Zone Mortalis & Sector Mechanicus:** Pitch Black.
- **Ash Wastes:** Changing Seasons.

After this phase these exceptions are no longer in effect.

If there are no more uncontrolled Resources, challengers nominate a Resource currently controlled by their opponent.

### Phase 2: Downtime

Complete the following steps:

1. [Fighters Recover](/docs/campaigns/dominion-campaign/running-the-campaign#a-fighters-recover)
2. [Captives are Returned](/docs/campaigns/dominion-campaign/running-the-campaign#b-captives-are-returned)
3. [Experienced Juves are Promoted](/docs/campaigns/dominion-campaign/running-the-campaign#c-experienced-juves-and-prospects-are-promoted)
4. [Fresh Recruitment](/docs/campaigns/dominion-campaign/running-the-campaign#d-fresh-recruitment)
5. Declare Allegiance

#### Declaring Allegiance

Each gang must declare allegiance to one of the following:

- Imperial House.
- Unaligned.
- Lady Credo's Rebellion.

Note: The campaign is designed to have at least 1 gang fight for and against the rebellion (with number of gangs unaligned).

Each allegiance will provide several unique bonuses that applies for the rest of the campaign.

Before each battle, roll 4+ to choose one of the following Hired Guns for free this battle (automatically leaves after the battle regardless of any special rules). Ignore the normal gang restrictions when gaining this bonus. Note that Agents have additional petition restrictions that needs to be met.

| Imperial House                                                                                    | Unaligned                                                                                                                                                                                                | Lady Credo's Rebellion                                                                                        |

Any gang that only controls Gang Resources must make this choice.                                                                   |                                                                                                               |

### Phase 3: Spark of Rebellion

Resources:

- Any unclaimed are removed.
- Only those already controlled can be won as the stake of battles.
- All boons from resources are rewarded.

Ash Wastes battles use Season of Ash.

## Scenario Selection

:::note

It is up to the campaign to organise how they want to choose scenarios. Each gaming group is different and have different approaches. One option is to use the selection table suggested by the campaign designers below.

:::

When a challenge is issued, roll 2D6 on the table below to determine which scenario is used. If the scenario dictates there is an attacker and a defender, the player that issued the challenge is the attacker. Where there is a choice of two scenarios, the first scenario should be played in the Great Darkness phase and the second one in the Spark of Rebellion phase.

| &nbsp;&nbsp;2D6&nbsp;&nbsp; | Result                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| :-------------------------: | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|             2-3             | The player with the greater number of Sympathisers chooses which scenariotoplay. If both players have the samenumber of Sympathisers, the winner of a roll-off chooses which scenario to play. |
|             4-5             | Play the [Fall of Badzones Outpost](/docs/scenarios/scenario-list/fall-of-badzones-outpost) or the [Parley Showdown](/docs/scenarios/scenario-list/parley-showdown) scenario.                  |
|             6-7             | Play the [Gunk War](/docs/scenarios/scenario-list/gunk-war) or the [Battle of the Riftways](/docs/scenarios/scenario-list/battle-of-the-riftways) scenario.                                    |
|             8-9             | Play the [Out of the Storm](/docs/scenarios/scenario-list/out-of-the-storm) or the [Street Fight](/docs/scenarios/scenario-list/street-fight) scenario.                                        |
|            10-12            | The player with fewer Sympathisers chooses which scenario to play. If both players have the same number of Sympathisers, the winner of a roll-off chooses which scenario to play.              |
