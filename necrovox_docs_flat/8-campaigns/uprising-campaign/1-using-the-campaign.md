# Using The Campaign

_Source: Necromunda: Apocrypha Necromunda (2024)_

_The baleful gaze of the Lord of Skin and Sinew has fallen upon Hive Arcos, driving its people to savage hunger and bloody madness. Gangs must choose the role they are to play in the carnage to follow, either clinging to the ideals of the Imperium and the rule of law, or giving in to their basest instincts and surrendering themselves to the whims of the Blood God!_

The Uprising Campaign is a complete narrative
campaign that can be used alongside the Necromunda
rules. It incorporates many of the existing Necromunda
campaign rules, adding additional special rules to
capture the desperate decline of a hive in the grips of a
Chaos uprising and the breakdown of Imperial law.

In the Uprising Campaign, players take sides, allying
themselves with the Imperial authorities, offering
their allegiance to the Dark Gods, or (at least in the
beginning) attempting to remain neutral, looking
out solely for their own interests. As the campaign
progresses and the cannibal apocalypse unfolds,
the power of one side or the other will wane,
until a breaking point is reached, and a final battle
to determine the fate of the hive is played.

:::note DESIGNER’S NOTE

Whilst the Uprising Campaign is designed to
allow players to recreate the events within the
doomed Hive Arcos, players can use these rules to
represent a similar, small scale uprising in almost
any hive. Players may even wish to play an Uprising
Campaign with gangs they have used in another
campaign, representing such dire periods of civil
unrest on a more local scale.

### The Arbitrator

The Uprising Campaign requires one of the players to
take on the role of an Arbitrator. It is the Arbitrator’s
job to keep track of victories, offer guidance for
the players and control any random events or
elements. In the Uprising Campaign, the Arbitrator’s
responsibilities include:

- Organising the players and making a list of all of the
  gangs involved in the campaign.
- Keeping the players informed as to the progression
  of the campaign, and whether Chaos or Order are in
  Ascendancy (see page 80).
- Deciding when each phase of the campaign begins
  and ends, as well as when the overall campaign
  begins and ends.

### The Gangs

Hive rebellions and daemonic incursions are
notoriously indifferent when it comes to who they
affect, and all kinds of local factions can find
themselves caught up in the fighting. The Uprising
Campaign can be played with any Necromunda gangs
– and guidelines for including different kinds of gangs
are presented in the Setting up the Campaign section
on page 76.

### Uprising Territories

While the focus of the Uprising Campaign is the
struggle between Order and Chaos, Territories still play
a large part in the conflict. These represent the turf
controlled by the gangs and provide them with a steady
supply of resources along with various other benefits.
Players begin the campaign in control of one or more
Territories, and have the opportunity to capture various
Territories as the campaign progresses.

In the Uprising Campaign, each Territory can be under
the influence of Order, or under the influence of Chaos.
When the campaign begins, all Territories are under
the influence of Order, but as the campaign progresses
they can be Ruined and come under the influence
of Chaos, representing the gradual corruption of the
hive. The Boons gangs gain from Territories change
depending upon which influence the Territory is under
(see page 88).

### Pre- and Post-Battle Sequence

The Uprising Campaign uses all of the standard rules
for the pre- and post-battle sequences presented in the
Necromunda Core Rulebook, including the gaining and
spending of XP.

### Winning

Victory in the Uprising Campaign goes beyond the
final domination of Chaos or Order. At the end of the
campaign, the Arbitrator awards various Triumphs (see
page 86) based upon such things as the most victories
for Order or Chaos, the most people consumed or
saved, or which gang has the highest Reputation.
