# Uprising Territories

_Source: Necromunda: Apocrypha Necromunda (2024)_

As the insidious threat of Chaos spreads, the hive
districts are reduced to cannibal-haunted wastelands,
and locals are driven into madness and depravity.
This inevitable societal decay is reflected in the
Territories controlled by the gangs. At the start of the
campaign, gangs might have dominion over bustling
underhive settlements or lucrative crossroads, reaping
the benefits of trade and a large populace to draw
recruits from. As the campaign wears on, these same
settlements and byways can be reduced to ruins,
inhabited by haunted survivors and ravenous beasts,
from which the gang must scavenge equipment
and food.

## Starting Territories

At the start of the Uprising Campaign, each player’s
gang begins in control of three Territories. One of these
is determined by the type of gang they are playing
as detailed below. This represents the gang’s home
base or hideout and can never be lost, even if it is the
only Territory the gang controls. The two remaining
Territories are generated randomly.

To determine these Territories, each player rolls on the
Uprising Territories table that follows. Gangs may have
the same Territory multiple times, though only Palanite
Enforcer gangs may have a Precinct-Fortress, and only
Corpse Grinder Cult and Helot Chaos Cult gangs may
have a Chaos Fane.

### Gang Starting Territory

**Palanite Enforcer Gangs:** Precinct-Fortress

**Corpse Grinder Cult Gangs and Chaos Cult Gangs:** Chaos Fane

**All Other Gangs:** Settlement

## Using Uprising Territories

Each Territory provides Boons to the gang who controls
it. At the beginning of each Campaign Week, each
player generates any Boons listed on their Territories,
such as Income and Recruits. In the case of variable
rolls or other random results, these dice rolls can be
made during the pre-battle sequence of the first game
of the Campaign Week with their results taking effect
immediately – i.e., recruited fighters can be used
right away.

Territories provide two sets of Boons: a standard one,
reflecting the Territory as it is under the influence of
Order, and a Ruined one, representing the Territory
once it has fallen under the influence of Chaos.
Only one of these sets of Boons applies at any time
depending on the state of the Territory, and Boons that
apply to rules that are not in effect – such as portions
of Meat gained while the Starvation rules are not being
used – are ignored. Once a Territory has been Ruined
and fallen under the influence of Chaos, it remains
Ruined for the remainder of the campaign.
