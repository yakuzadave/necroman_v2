# Uprising Territories

Each Territory has unique bonuses. A gang receives the benefits of a Territory so long as it holds it. Benefits of Territories
are gained before each cycle.

Once the Territory is lost (for example taken by another gang), the bonus is also lost.

There are 2 ways to take control of Territories:

- Winning a battle with a Territory at stake.
- Territory as exchange for Captives.

## Campaign variations

#### Total Resources

| Campaign | Amount of Resources                          |
| :------- | :------------------------------------------- |
| Uprising | All (except Precinct Fortress & Chaos Fane). |

#### Unique Resources

There are no unique resources in an Uprising campaign. |

### Resource Bonuses

All Resources are unique and have different bonuses:

#### Income

Add the amount of credits to the Stash when collecting income from Resources (including any that was won from the previous battle).

#### Recruits

- Free to recruit (does not cost any credits).
- The cost is added to Gang Rating and Wealth.
- Equipment must be purchased separately (unless otherwise specified).
- Hired guns remain with the gang while in control of the Resource.
- Hangers-on can be recruited regardless of Reputation and will not affect the maximum amount of Hangers-on the gang may have.

:::tip YAQ
Once the Resource is lost, the Hangers-on is also lost. The Hangers-on will never leave the gang because of injuries and can't be killed. Note that this means it’s important to distinguish between those that are regular hangers-on and those territory-related (if you control both types and at least one is drafted into a battle).
:::

#### Equipment

- Can be distributed to eligible fighters.
- _Free_ equipment is lost when the Resource is lost.
- Purchased equipment is kept after the Resource is lost.
- The (full) cost is added to Gang Rating and Wealth, even for discounted and free items.

#### Reputation

Increase the Reputation while in control of the Resource. When the Resource is lost, decrease Reputation with the equal amount.

#### Special

If the Resource is lost, so is the benefit.

### Enhanced Bonuses

Some Resources have Enhanced bonuses that require specific criterias to be met in order to claim them.

#### Gang-Specific

Gang Specific bonuses can only be claimed by the specified gang. It will replace generic bonuses of the same type.

#### Linked

Linked bonuses can be claimed by taking control of the specified Resources. They are claimed in addition to any duplicate types of bonuses, except income. Only a single Income bonus can be claimed.
