# Running The Campaign

_Source: Necromunda: Apocrypha Necromunda (2024)_


The Uprising Campaign is divided into three phases, all of which run for a fixed length
of real time. It is important for the Arbitrator and players alike to pay
careful attention to the passing Campaign Weeks during an Uprising Campaign
as, at the start of each Campaign Week, gangs have the opportunity to ‘work’ their
Territories for much-needed resources:

| Phase                     | Duration             |
| :------------------------ | :------------------- |
| **1. Insurrection phase** | Three Campaign Weeks |
| **2. Downtime**           | One Campaign Week    |
| **3. Damnation phase**    | Three Campaign Weeks |

Each phase is broken down as follows:

## 1. Insurrection Phase (3 Campaign Weeks)

The first part of the Uprising Campaign charts the rise of the rebellion and the
destruction of reason and law within the hive.

- At the beginning of each campaign week, gangs receive the benefits from
  their Territories.
- At the end of each campaign week in which Chaos gains Ascendancy (see below),
  each player must choose one of their Territories to become Ruined.

### Ascendancy

A key part of the Uprising Campaign is the struggle between the Ruinous Powers
and the iron authority of the Imperium. As each side waxes and wanes in strength,
entire regions of the hive are turned into war zones and, piece by piece, the great city
descends deeper into unrestrained mayhem.

At the start of the first campaign week, Order will automatically have Ascendancy.

At the end of each campaign week, the Arbitrator tallies up the number of scenarios
won by Chaos and the number won by Order. The side with the most victories
gains, or retains, Ascendancy for the following campaign week. In the case of a tie,
whichever side has Ascendancy retains it.

#### Ascendancy Effects

Ascendancy has an effect on every battle, reflecting the ebb and flow of
the Uprising. When fighting a battle, during the pre-battle sequence, the player who
issued the challenge rolls a D6. If Chaos has Ascendancy then apply the result from
the Hand of Chaos table. If Order has Ascendancy, then apply the result from the
Bonds of Order table.

### Hand Of Chaos

| D6  | Result                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| :-: | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  1  | **Manufactorum Shortages:** During the post-battle sequence of this battle, both players must add 10 credits to the cost of any items purchased from their gang lists or the Trading Post. If this battle is being fought during the Damnation phase then both players reduce their number of Scavenging rolls by 1.                                                                          |
|  2  | **Dark Dreams:** During the battle, fighters that become Broken must make a Willpower test before testing to Rally in the End phase. If they fail then they are no longer Broken but become subject to the Insane condition.                                                                                                                                                                  |
|  3  | **Rotting Meat:** At the end of the battle, Seriously Injured fighters succumb to their injuries on a D6 roll of 1, 2 or 3, rather than just a 1 or 2. If the rules for Festering Injuries are in effect then fighters at risk of suffering a Festering Injury must roll two D6 and choose the highest result.                                                                                |
|  4  | **Abundant Dead:** At the end of the battle, any fighters killed (as indicated by a result on the Lasting Injuries table) are worth D6x10 credits to their gang. If the rules for Starvation are in effect, then each dead fighter is worth one additional portion of Meat.                                                                                                                   |
|  5  | **Blood for the Blood God:** When a fighter takes an enemy Out of Action with a weapon with the Melee trait, they earn an additional 1 XP.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|  6  | **Gnawing Hunger:** After selecting crews, both players randomly select one friendly fighter in their crew. For the duration of the battle, the selected fighter reduces their Strength characteristic by 1. If the rules for Starvation are in effect then instead each player rolls a D3 and randomly selects that many fighters in their crew. These fighters gain the Starving condition. |

### Bonds of Order

| D6  | Result                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| :-: | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  1  | **Price of Victory:** At the end of the scenario, in addition to any other rewards, the victorious gang receives an additional D6x10 credits. If the rules for Scavenging are in effect then the victorious gang receives 1 extra Scavenging roll instead.         |
|  2  | **Head Hunters:** For the duration of the battle, whenever a fighter takes a Leader or Champion Out of Action, they earn an additional 1 XP.                                                                                                                       |
|  3  | **Crack Down:** In the post-battle sequence, fighters belonging to the losing gang only avoid being Captured on a roll of a natural 6.                                                                                                                             |
|  4  | **Suppression Orders:** For the duration of the battle, whenever a fighter takes an enemy Out of Action with a ranged weapon, they earn an additional 1 XP.                                                                                                        |
|  5  | **Good Medicine:** During the post-battle sequence of this battle, the credit cost for the Medical Escort post-battle action is D6x10, rather than 2D6x10. If the End of Days rule is in effect then the Medical Escort post-battle action does not cost any Meat. |
|  6  | **Call to Arms:** Halve the cost of any Gangers chosen during the Hire a Fighter sub-step of the post-battle sequence of this battle (rounded up to the nearest 5 credits).                                                                                        |

## 1. Downtime (1 Campaign Week)

During Downtime, gangs have a chance to recover and
regroup, taking the opportunity to re-equip,
and fix up wounded fighters. Exceptionally bold and
active players might put their gangs through a special
side battle (as follows) if they just can’t be away from
the roar of guns and chainblades for that long.

### The Effects Of Downtime

After their last battle of the Insurrection phase,
players complete the following steps at the end of
the post-battle sequence:

1. Fighters Recover
2. Captives are Returned
3. Experienced Juves and Prospects are Promoted
4. Fresh Recruitment

### 1. Fighters Recover

Any In Recovery boxes on the gang roster are cleared.

### 2. Captives Are Returned

Any Captured fighters are released. The gang that
had Captured them receives half their credits value
(rounding up to the nearest 5 credits).

### 3. Experienced Juves And Prospects Are Promoted

If any gang contains any Juves or Prospects with three
or more Advancements, they may be promoted. Their
characteristics and credits value are unaffected, but
their Type is changed as described in their fighter entry.

### 4. Fresh Recruitment

All gangs gain 250 credits to spend on new equipment
from their Gang Equipment List or to recruit new
fighters, vehicles and/or Hangers-on. These credits
must be spent now and cannot be added to the
gang’s Stash. Gangs may supplement these credits
with extra credits from their Stash.

:::note

### Side Battles

Side battles are special battles fought during
Downtime. While most players will be happy with
taking a break for a week and getting ready for the
Damnation phase, there may be a few who can’t
go a week without their fix of gang warfare. To
satisfy this need, an Arbitrator can run one or more
side battles during Downtime. Side battles are
fought after the effects of Downtime are applied.

Side battles should, as a rule, be unusual, and
have no effect on the campaign as a whole. They
are a great opportunity for the Arbitrator to design
a custom scenario, to use the Arbitrator tools
from the Necromunda Core Rulebook, or to play
some of the narrative scenarios. Fighters can earn
Experience and suffer Lasting Injuries from a side
battle, but should not gain or earn Income, or gain
credits or Reputation as a reward for a side battle.
Instead, the Arbitrator should create a special
reward for the victor or victors of a side battle,
such as an unpredictable piece of archeotech, a
unique chem, or a custom gang tactic.

:::

## 1. Damnation Phase (3 Campaign Weeks)

The third phase of the Uprising Campaign charts the
hive’s descent into madness and horror. During this
phase the following rules apply:

- At the beginning of this phase, all Territories become
  Ruined if they are not already.
- At the beginning of each week, gangs receive the
  Benefits from their Territories.
- The rules for Scavenging, Festering Injuries and
  Starvation come into effect (see below).
- Chaos begins this phase in Ascendancy.

### End Of Days

During the Insurrection phase, the rule of law
remains mostly intact and the ancient mechanisms
of Imperial authority ensure a semblance of order. In
the Damnation phase, these systems begin to break
down and true anarchy takes the hive within its grasp.
This rise of lawlessness, open warfare and rampant
corruption are represented by a number of special
conditions coming into effect for this final phase of
the campaign.

Gangs may no longer purchase equipment from their
Gang Equipment Lists during the post-battle sequence.
In addition, gangs cannot recruit new fighters, Hired
Guns and Hangers-on.

Docs no longer accept credits when gangs visit them
as part of the Medical Escort post-battle action.
Instead, the cost of visiting the Doc becomes D3
portions of Meat.

Captured fighters cannot be sold to the Guilders.
Captured fighters can instead be turned into one
portion of Meat (as follows) after their gang has had a
chance to rescue them as normal.

In addition to these changes to the
post-battle sequence, three new rules are introduced:
Scavenging, Starvation and Festering Injuries.

### Scavenging

As the Guilds succumb to Chaos, fragment, or go into
hiding, and entire regions within the hive become
impassable, gangs are forced to forage among the
ruins for equipment and allies. Gangs can gain
Scavenging rolls from their Territories and as rewards
for playing some scenarios. Each Scavenging roll can
be used to roll once on the Scavenging table.

When a gang earns a Scavenging roll, the player makes
a note of it on their gang roster, and may then use it in
the post-battle sequence of any battle when they would
normally be able to purchase equipment.

Scavenging is a dangerous business, for the hive
wilderness is filled with cannibal cults and starving
wildlife. Results on the Scavenging table range from
encounters with monsters that will savage the gang’s
fighters and leave them empty handed, to discovering
bands of survivors offering fresh recruits and precious
weaponry. Because of these perils, players do not have
to roll on the Scavenging table if they don’t want to,
and during the post-battle sequence may use any, all
or none of their stashed Scavenging rolls.

#### Scavenging Table

| &nbsp;&nbsp;2D6&nbsp;&nbsp; | Result                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| :-------------------------: | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|             2-3             | **Unfortunate Encounter:** Randomly select one of the gang’s fighters and make a roll on the Lasting Injury table for them.                                                                                                                           |
|             4-5             | **Paid in Blood:** Roll 3D6 and add that many credits worth of items from the gang’s Gang Equipment List to their Stash. Then, randomly select one of the gang’s fighters and make a roll on the Lasting Injury table for them.                       |
|             6-7             | **Useful Scrap:** Roll D6x10 and choose a single item from the gang’s Gang Equipment List up to this value in credits and add it to their Stash.                                                                                                      |
|             8-9             | **Hidden Cache:** Roll D6x10 and add that many credits worth of items from the gang’s Gang Equipment List to their Stash.                                                                                                                             |
|            10-11            | **Band of Survivors:** Add a Ganger to the gang’s roster. This fighter may be equipped for free with 2D6x10 credits of weapons and Wargear chosen from the Gang Equipment List.                                                                       |
|             12              | **Lost Holestead:** Roll a D6. On a 1-5, add a Ganger to the gang’s roster. On a 6, add a Champion to the gang’s roster. This fighter may be equipped for free with 4D6x10 credits of weapons and Wargear chosen from the gang’s Gang Equipment List. |

### Starvation

Hunger gnaws at the heart of the hive, making people
savage with gluttonous madness. As the power of
the Corpse Grinder Cults grows, the influence of their
hidden master spreads, bringing with it an unnatural
hunger for human flesh. With the breakdown of order
and the cessation of corpse-starch production, food
rapidly becomes more important than coin for the
inhabitants of the hive.

When the Starvation rules come into effect, players
are required to feed their gang during the pre-battle
sequence of each battle before selecting their crew.
Each fighter requires a portion of Meat to stave off
hunger. Meat can be gained from Territories, earned
as part of scenarios, ‘acquired’ from captive fighters
or by ‘retiring’ fighters. Each fighter ‘retired’ from the
gang in this way is worth one portion of Meat. Survivors
acquired as part of Scavenging can also be turned
into portions of Meat in the same way on a onefor-
one basis. In either case, any weapons and Wargear
that the fighter was equipped with are added to the
gang’s Stash.

If the player cannot feed a fighter, or chooses not to,
the fighter gains the Starving condition (the player
noting it on the gang’s roster and placing a token
on the fighter’s card during battles as a reminder).
Starving fighters retain the Starving condition until they
either eat a portion of Meat in the pre-battle sequence
or cannibalise a downed opponent (as follows). The
Starvation condition has the following effects on
a fighter:

The fighter counts their Strength characteristic as 1
lower when making Strength checks, unarmed attacks
and when working out the strength of weapons with
the Melee trait.

The fighter gains access to the Cannibalise (Basic)
action and can use it during their activations as they
would other actions.

Starving fighters must make a Willpower test when they
activate if there is a Prone and Seriously Injured fighter
(friend or foe) within their maximum Charge range. If
they fail this test, they must Charge the downed fighter
and perform a Cannibalise (Basic) action. If for any
reason they cannot reach their intended victim, such
as if there are other models in the way or impassable
terrain then they must use their activation to move as
close to the downed fighter as possible.

If the fighter has an opportunity to perform a Coup de
Grace action (such as against an opponent that has
been Seriously Injured in close combat), they instead
make a Cannibalise action.

**Cannibalise (Basic) Action:** The fighter feeds on
the flesh of a wounded fighter. This action can be
performed in place of a Fight action or a Coup de
Grace action. It can only be made against fighters who
are Prone and Seriously Injured. Immediately roll on the
Lasting Injuries table for the fighter being fed upon and
apply the result, counting results of Lesson Learned
(11) as Out Cold (15-26). Note, the Prone and Seriously
Injured fighter remains on the battlefield, and may be
fed upon again, unless they roll a Captured (55-56),
Critical Injury (61-65) or Memorable Death (66) result,
in which case they are removed from the battlefield
and considered to have been taken Out of Action (do
not roll again on the Lasting Injury table for them).

A fighter who has successfully fed using the
Cannibalise action loses the Starving condition.

:::note DESIGNER’S NOTE: MODELLING MUTATIONS

While mutations can simply be recorded on a
fighter’s card (after all, it is easy to imagine the
members of a gang being a little circumspect
about displaying their mutations openly), modelling
mutations onto fighters can also be a fun way to
represent them on the tabletop and as a reminder
of who among a player’s gang has succumbed to
the taint of Chaos.

:::

## Festering Injuries

Open wounds are a gateway for more than just disease
and rot. The Blood God exalts in torn flesh and severed
muscle, bestowing his blessings on those that spill
gore in his sight. In addition to the ever-present risk
of infection and death, gangers fighting beneath
the gaze of the Lord of Skin and Sinew risk more
unnatural dangers.

When the Festering Injuries rules are in effect and a
fighter gains a Lasting Injury (regardless of the cause),
there is a chance that it will become a mutation. If the
result was Humiliated, Head Injury, Eye Injury, Hand
Injury, Hobbled, Spinal Injury or Enfeebled roll a D6
with the following modifiers:

- Add 1 if the Lasting Injury was inflicted by a fighter
  aligned to Chaos.
- Add 1 if the Lasting Injury was sustained
  during a Campaign Week in which Chaos
  was in Ascendancy.
- Add 1 if the fighter who suffered the Lasting Injury
  has the Starving condition.

If the result of the roll is 6 or more then the Lasting
Injury becomes a mutation. Do not apply the effects
of the Lasting Injury to the fighter and instead make
a note on their Fighter card of the corresponding
mutation (see the Festering Injuries table below). The
same mutation cannot be gained more than once. If a
fighter would gain a duplicate mutation, the player may
choose another mutation from the Festering Injuries
table instead.

The boons of the Dark Gods always come with a price,
and no one suffers their blessings for long without
succumbing to madness and corruption. As soon as
a fighter gains a number of mutations equal to their
Toughness characteristic, they are transformed into
a Chaos Spawn and removed from the gang roster.
Alternatively, if you have access to Necromunda: The
Book of Ruin, a Chaos Helot Cult, Corpse Grinder Cult
or Chaos-corrupted gang may instead replace the lost
fighter with a Chaos Spawn (see Necromunda: The
Book of Ruin).

### Festering Injuries Table

| Lasting Injury    | Mutation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| :---------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Humiliated**    | **Hungering Pride:** The fighter must activate before any other fighters in their crew. If there is more than one fighter in the crew with this mutation, the controlling player may choose which one to activate first. Fighters with this mutation gain 1 additional Experience point if they take an enemy Leader or Champion Out of Action. |
| **Head Injury**   | **Dark Madness:** The fighter must make an Intelligence test when they activate. If the test is failed, roll a D6 to determine their first action: 1-2 Move (Simple) action, 3-4 Shoot (Basic) or Fight (Basic) action, 5-6 No action.                                                                                                          |
| **Eye Injury**    | **Bestial Senses:** The fighter cannot be included as part of a group activation, nor can they initiate a group activation if they are a Leader or Champion. The fighter counts as always being equipped with a bio-scanner.                                                                                                                    |
| **Hand Injury**   | **Disturbing Appendage:** The fighter always counts as being equipped with a fighting knife which cannot be disarmed or destroyed.

## Winning

Victory in the Uprising Campaign can be measured in many ways, although simply
surviving the effects of starvation, societal collapse and the brutal madness of the
Blood God is an achievement in itself. At the end of the campaign, the Arbitrator
awards Triumphs to the players depending on how their gangs have performed
during the uprising. Some of these reflect the final fate of the hive and the ascension
of Chaos or the restoration of Imperial rule, while others are more personal
and reward gangs who have earned the most impressive reputation or outlived
the competition.

The Arbitrator should have a look at the Triumphs at the start of the Uprising
Campaign as some of them require keeping track of how many battles each gang
has won, and of which kind. Likewise, the Arbitrator might like to make the players
aware of the different Triumphs at the beginning of the campaign so that each player
can decide if there is one or more they wish to try to achieve. Below is a list of the
Uprising Campaign Triumphs:
