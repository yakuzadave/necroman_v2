# Terrain

_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

Terrain plays a vitally important role in Necromunda. Not only does it provide a dense and challenging battlefield for gangs to fight over, but it also instils battles with the character of the world in which those gangs exist.

How terrain can impact the game and the rules governing specific terrain features will be presented elsewhere within this book. For example, the ways in which terrain can hamper movement is dealt with in the Movement section. There are, however, a few features that should be dealt with here as general principles.

**Impassable Terrain:** Any terrain can be designated
impassable when setting up the battlefield, regardless
of size. Impassable terrain may include solid sections
of wall, vertiginous rock formations or towering vats of
molten metal. Impassable terrain cannot, as the name
suggests, be moved through or over.

**Walls:** Walls are almost always considered impassable
terrain. On a battlefield of only one level, it is assumed
that at the top of each wall sits a ceiling, preventing
fighters from climbing over a wall. However, on a
battlefield that covers multiple levels, featuring
ladders, staircases and even lifts, it is possible for
fighters to scale and even climb over walls.

**Solid Terrain Features:** Particularly solid terrain
features are treated similarly to walls. Any terrain
designated as solid when setting up the battlefield is
considered impassable, as described above.

**Doors:** These come in various sizes, but their rules
are the same regardless of size – they are set up as
part of the pre-battle sequence. By default, all doors
are closed at the start of a battle, unless a scenario
specifies otherwise. Closed doors are considered
impassable terrain. They cannot be moved through and
block both line of sight and measurement in the same
way as walls and solid terrain as described previously.

Any fighter may open a closed door or close an open
door by performing an [Operate Door (Simple)](/docs/the-rules/fighter-actions#operate-door-simple) action
during their activation. If a door opens
or closes within 1" of a [booby trap](/docs/battlefield-setup/scenario-rules#booby-traps--frag-gas-and-melta), it
may be triggered.

Closed doors, locked or otherwise, can be targeted
by attacks and are automatically hit. All doors have a
Toughness of 5 and 4 Wounds; if a door is reduced to
0 Wounds, it is removed from the battlefield.

**Locked Doors & Terminals:** When a door is set up
during the pre-battle sequence, two door terminals
may be placed, one on either side of the door, touching the wall within 1" of it. The presence of a door
terminal indicates that the door is locked and very
secure indeed!

A fighter cannot perform an Operate Door (Simple)
action against a locked door. Instead, they must
perform an [Access Terminal (Basic)](/docs/the-rules/fighter-actions#access-terminal-basic) action or a [Force Door (Basic)](/docs/the-rules/fighter-actions#force-door-basic) action in order to unlock
the door. Once a locked door has been opened in
this way, it remains unlocked for the remainder of
the battle.

In a scenario where one gang is the attacker and the
other gang the defender, the defender is assumed
to have the access codes for any locked doors, and
can make an Operate Door (Simple) action on themas normal.

**Obstacles & Structures:** Obstacles are any free
standing terrain features measuring no more than 2"
high and no more than 2" across, although they may be
far longer, such as barricades, barrels and pipelines.

Structures are any terrain features measuring more
than 2" high or more than 2" across, be they free
standing or connected to other terrain features in some
way. Structures may feature many different levels, platforms and walkways on which fighters may be
placed. Structures may be further classified as being
‘sturdy’ or ‘flimsy’. Sturdy structures cannot be knocked
down by vehicles (see [Vehicle Impacts: Colliding With Terrain](/docs/the-rules/vehicle-impacts#colliding-with-terrain)).

Both obstacles and structures may interrupt line of
sight and offer cover to models as described previously
and in the shooting rules.

Fighters may climb over obstacles or up onto structures
as described in the Movement rules, but players
should be aware that movement may be reduced or
not possible in some cases.
