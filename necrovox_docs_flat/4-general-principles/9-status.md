# Status

## Fighter Status

A fighter’s Status dictates what they can or cannot do. The actions a fighter can perform during their activation will depend heavily upon their current Status. During a game of Necromunda, a fighter’s Status can change. This is generally represented by how the fighter is positioned on the battlefield, be they Standing or Prone, as described below, but may also depend upon other factors.

### Standing

A fighter that is upright on the battlefield is said to be
‘Standing’. Whilst Standing, a fighter may perform a
wide range of actions with relative ease.

#### Secondary Statuses While Standing

Whilst Standing, a fighter will always be subject to
one of two Secondary Statuses as well: ‘Active’ or
‘Engaged’. This Secondary Status will affect the actions
a Standing fighter may perform during their activation.

**Active:** A Standing fighter is Active if they are not currently engaged with any enemy fighters. This is the default Status for a fighter; Standing and Active, and such fighters enjoy the greatest freedom to perform actions.

**Engaged:** In order for fighters to make close combat attacks, they must be engaging an enemy model:

- If the base of a Standing fighter is touching the base of an enemy fighter, they are said to be in base to base contact and are engaged with that enemy fighter.
- If the base of a Standing fighter is within 1" of any part of an enemy vehicle, they may choose to Engage that vehicle.
- A vehicle cannot Engage an enemy fighter.

A Standing fighter that is Engaged can generally only
choose actions that allow them to fight or retreat, but
other factors such as skills may increase the number
of available options.

Players should note that in some cases a fighter may
be able to Engage an enemy fighter they are not in
base to base contact with, or an enemy vehicle that
they are not within 1" of. For example, weapons with
the Versatile trait allow a fighter to Engage enemy
models from further away.

### Prone

A fighter that is laid down is ‘Prone’. A Prone fighter
has no facing and they effectively have no vision arc.
Unless otherwise stated, Prone fighters never block line
of sight – they are considered to be well out of the way
of the action. A Prone fighter may be placed face-up or
face-down, depending upon their Secondary Status.

#### Secondary Statuses While Prone

Whilst Prone, a fighter will always be subject to one of
two Secondary Statuses as well: ‘Pinned’ or ‘Seriously
Injured’. This Secondary Status will affect the actions a
Prone fighter may perform and the way in which other
models may interact with them.

**Pinned:** Fighters generally become Prone and ‘Pinned’
as a result of being hit by enemy fire, and will need
to spend an action to stand up, becoming Standing
and Active. If a Prone and Pinned fighter ever becomes
engaged by an enemy fighter, they will immediately
perform a Stand Up (Basic) action for free (i.e., without
having to spend an action to do so), becoming Standing
and Engaged, though they do count as having had to [Turn to Face](/docs/the-rules/close-combat#1-turn-to-face). A fighter can never be both Prone and Pinned and Engaged.

A Prone fighter that is Pinned is laid face-up, representing the fighter keeping their head down to avoid enemy fire.

**Seriously Injured:** If a fighter should suffer a ‘Serious
Injury’ result on an Injury dice (either as the result
of being reduced to 0 Wounds, or as the result of
an attack from a weapon with a Trait such as Gas or
Toxin), that fighter is laid face-down and becomes
Prone and Seriously Injured. A fighter is very vulnerable
whilst this is their Status, being susceptible to enemy
attacks against which they cannot defend themselves
and being unable to move quickly towards safety.

## Vehicle Status

The Status of a vehicle indicates its degree of mobility. The actions available to a vehicle during its activation
will depend heavily upon its current Status. During a game of Necromunda, a vehicle’s Status can change. This generally represents how fast the vehicle is moving or, if it has halted, why it has done so, as described
below, but may also depend upon other factors.

### Mobile

Whilst a vehicle is ‘Mobile’ it is able to move quite
freely around the battlefield, performing a range of
actions with ease.

### Stationary

A vehicle that is unable to move for any reason is
‘Stationary’. Whilst Stationary, the actions available to
the vehicle may be dramatically reduced.

#### Secondary Status Whilst Stationary

Whilst Stationary, a vehicle will always be subject to
one of two Secondary Statuses as well: ‘Stalled’ or
‘Wrecked’. This Secondary Status essentially explains
why the vehicle is Stationary and will determine how
easily it can become Mobile (if at all) and which actions
it can perform during its activation.

**Stalled:** A Stationary vehicle is Stalled if it has been
forced to stop moving by an enemy attack, by damage, or by any other in-game effect or special rule that
prevents the vehicle from moving. Stalled vehicles
can often fire their weapons, but must ‘Restart’ (see [Stationary & Stalled Vehicles](/docs/the-rules/vehicle-actions#stationary--stalled-vehicles)) before they can move off.

**Wrecked:** During the course of a battle, a vehicle
might become Stationary and Wrecked due to damage
sustained. Once a vehicle is Wrecked it can no longer
perform any actions and is treated like a piece
of terrain.

:::note

### Determining Status

The Primary and Secondary Status of both fighters
and vehicles can change often. Most often, Status
will change during the model’s activation, but it
can also change during the activation of other
models. Players should determine the Primary
and Secondary Status of each model at the end
of its activation for the benefit of their opponent
and keep track of any changes as play progresses. When a model is activated, confirm its current
Primary and Secondary Status.
