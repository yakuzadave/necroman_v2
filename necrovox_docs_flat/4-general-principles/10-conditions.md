# Conditions

_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

A fighter’s Status is always either Standing and Active, Standing and Engaged, Prone
and Pinned or Prone and Seriously Injured, but they may also be subject to one or
more of the following Conditions. Conditions are denoted by placing a Condition
marker either next to the fighter on the battlefield or on their Fighter card as a
reminder that the Condition is in effect. Some Conditions can also affect vehicles,
in these cases the Condition marker is placed either next to the vehicle or on their
Vehicle card.

The following list of Conditions is not exhaustive. Some Conditions are common and
will apply to a model many times during a battle. Others are less common and may
be the result of an attack from a weapon with a certain Trait; the full rules for such
Conditions can be found in the corresponding Weapon Trait rules. Other Conditions,
in particular Out of Ammo, may apply specifically to a weapon the model carries
rather than the model themselves. A model may be subject to several Conditions at
the same time.

Any in-game effect that results in a marker being placed on a model should be
considered a Condition.

## Common Conditions

The following Conditions are those most commonly used. A model can become subject to them for
numerous reasons:

### Ready

The most simple but arguably the most important
Condition. At the start of each round, during the Priority
phase, all models will have a Ready marker placed on
them. Once that model has activated during the Action
phase, this marker is removed, indicating that the
model may not be activated again.

### Broken

A fighter may become Broken as the result of either
seeing a friendly fighter Seriously Injured or taken
Out of Action within 3" of them, or seeing a friendly
vehicle Wrecked within 6" of them. Broken fighters
may not perform any actions other than Running for
Cover (Double), which they perform every time they are
activated. If Standing and Engaged, a Broken fighter
may only make Reaction attacks, and must apply a -2
modifier to their Hit rolls. Broken fighters may be rallied
in the End phase.

A vehicle may become Broken as the result of seeing
a friendly vehicle Wrecked within 6" of them. Broken
vehicles may not perform any actions other than
Break For Air (Double) if Mobile or Burn Out (Double) if
Stationary and Stalled, which they perform every time
they are activated. Broken vehicles may be rallied in
the End phase.

### Out Of Ammo

Should a model roll the Ammo symbol on [the Firepower dice](/docs/the-rules/shooting#the-firepower-dice), they are required
to make an immediate Ammo test for that weapon.
If this is failed, that weapon is now Out of Ammo. To
represent this, a marker is placed on the appropriate
weapon profile on the model’s Fighter card or Vehicle
card as a reminder that the weapon cannot be used
until it has been reloaded.

Note that, unlike other Conditions, Out of Ammo is
applied to a weapon carried by a model rather than the
model themselves. It is therefore possible for a model
to have multiple Out of Ammo markers on them at one
time, indicating more than one weapon is subject to
the Condition.

### Fleshwound(s)

These are suffered as a result of Injury dice rolls made
against a fighter, or the Driver Wounded result on the
[Crew Damage table](/docs/the-rules/resolve-hits-against-vehicles#crew-damage-table). A fighter can
suffer multiple Flesh Wounds, each of which reduces
their Toughness characteristic by 1 for the remainder
of the battle. If a fighter is reduced to Toughness 0 as a
result of multiple Flesh Wounds, they go Out of Action.

## Other Conditions

The following Conditions are less frequently seen, but are
no less significant. Models may become subject to them
as the result of an attack from a weapon with a certain
Trait, or as the result of a scenario or terrain special rule:

### Blaze

How the Blaze condition affects a model depends upon
whether it is a fighter or vehicle. Regardless of model
type, models subject to the Blaze condition can never
become Hidden and cannot make Reaction attacks.

**Fighter:** When activated, a fighter subject to the Blaze
condition suffers an immediate S3, AP -1, D1 hit (see [Resolving Hits](/docs/the-rules/resolve-hits)) and must act as follows, after which their
activation will end:

- If Prone and Pinned, the fighter immediately becomes Standing and Active and acts as described below.
- If Standing and Active, the fighter moves 2D6" in a random direction, determined by the Scatter dice. The fighter will stop moving if this movement would bring them within 1" of an enemy fighter or into base contact with impassable terrain. If this movement brings them within ½" of the edge of a level or platform, they risk falling. If this movement takes the fighter beyond the edge of a level or platform, they will simply fall. At the end of this move, the fighter may choose to become Prone and Pinned. The fighter may then attempt to put the fire out.
- If Standing and Engaged or Prone and Seriously Injured, the fighter does not move and attempts to put the fire out.

To attempt to put the fire out, roll a D6, adding 1 to the
result for each other Active friendly fighter within 1". On a
roll of 6 or more, the flames go out and the Blaze condition
is removed. Prone and Pinned or Seriously Injured fighters
add 2 to the roll to see if the flames go out.

:::note

## Vehicles And Conditions

There are a huge number of Conditions in
Necromunda, unless stated otherwise they do not
affect vehicles at all.

:::

**Vehicles:** When activated, a vehicle subject to the Blaze condition suffers an immediate S3, AP -1, D1 hit against the Rear Toughness (roll location as normal, see [Resolving Hits Against Vehicles](/docs/the-rules/resolve-hits-against-vehicles)). They must then make a Cool test:

- If passed, nothing happens, they can continue their activation as normal.
- If failed and the vehicle is Mobile, they act as if they had failed a [Loss of Control test](/docs/the-rules/resolve-hits-against-vehicles#loss-of-control-tests) then their activation ends.
- If failed and the vehicle is Stationary and Stalled, they must perform the Burn Out (Double) action then their activation ends.

At the end of their activation, roll a D6. On a 4+, the flames go out and the Blaze condition is removed.

### Blind

When hit by a weapon with the Flash trait, a fighter or
vehicle risks becoming [Blind](/docs/general-principles/conditions#blind). A Blind
model loses their Ready marker; if they do not have
a Ready marker, they do not gain a Ready marker at
the start of the following round. Until the next time the
model is activated, they cannot make any attacks other
than Reaction attacks, for which any hit rolls will only
succeed on a natural 6 (note: vehicles cannot make
Reaction attacks).

### Concussion

Any fighter hit by a Concussion weapon will have their
Initiative reduced by 2, to a minimum of 6+, until the
end of the round. Any vehicle hit by a Concussion
weapon will suffer a -2 penalty to all Handling tests
until the end of the round.

### Hidden/Revealed

Some scenarios or terrain special rules, such as the [Visibility rules](/docs/battlefield-setup/scenario-rules#pitch-black--visibility) allow models to gain the Hidden condition. Hidden models can then lose this Condition over the course of a game by gaining the Revealed condition.

### Intoxicated

There are numerous special rules that can cause a
model to become intoxicated. These include certain
skills, special rules associated with terrain or Wargear, and more besides. Whatever the cause, the ways in
which the Intoxicated condition affects a model are
many and varied, and will be detailed by the special
rules that cause the Condition.

### Insane

Certain skills, some types of terrain and some scenario
rules may lead a model to become temporarily insane. Models that have become subject to the Insane
condition for any reason can act quite erratically when
activated. When activating an Insane model, roll a D6
and consult the table below:

| D6  | Result                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| :-: | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1-2 | The model immediately becomes Broken – or, if they were already Broken, they flee the battlefield (even if their gang has not failed a Bottle check).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 3-4 | The opposing player can control the Insane model for the duration of this activation, treating them as part of their gang in all respects until their activation ends. As soon as their activation ends, the Insane model no longer counts as being a part of the opposing gang. In the case of a multi-player game, the winner of a roll-off between the other players will control the Insane model. |
| 5-6 | The model can act as normal for the duration of this activation. Once their activation is over, make a Willpower test for them. If it is passed, they lose their Insanity marker.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

:::danger House Rule (A&A)
Roll a willpower check at the end of activation to see if they become sane.
:::

### Webbed

While a fighter is Webbed, treat them as if they were
Seriously Injured and roll for Recovery for them
during the End phase (Web contains a powerful
sedative capable of rendering the strongest fighter
unconscious). If a Flesh Wound result is rolled during
Recovery, apply the result to the fighter as usual and
remove the Webbed condition. If a Serious Injury result
is rolled, the fighter remains Webbed, but they do not
gain a Flesh Wound. If an Out of Action result is rolled, the fighter succumbs to the powerful sedative and is
removed from play. Instead of rolling on the Lasting
Injury table, roll a D6 to determine what happens to
them – on a result of 1-4 suffer the 15-26 (Out Cold)
result, on a 5-6 they suffer the 55-56 (Captured) result
(see the [Lasting Injury Table](/docs/the-rules/resolve-hits#lasting-injury-table)).

A fighter that is Webbed at the end of the battle
does not succumb to their Injuries and will
automatically recover.

### Mounted

Several items of Wargear, ranging from beasts of
burden to Waster’s dirtbikes, give the fighter the
Mounted condition. This comprises of the following
group of rules:

**Hands Full:** A fighter that is Mounted reduces the total
number of weapons they can carry by one and cannot
be equipped with any weapon with the Unwieldy trait
unless it also has the Lance trait. In addition, they can
never use more than one weapon in close combat.

When fighting with a weapon with the Paired trait,
a fighter subject to the Mounted condition does not
gain a bonus attack for being equipped with two
close combat weapons, nor do they double their
Attacks characteristic when they perform a Charge
(Double) action.

**Ride By:** A Mounted fighter may move within 1" of
a single enemy model when performing a Move
(Simple) action. When doing so, or if within Long
range of a weapon with the Versatile trait, the fighter
may interrupt their movement to make a single close
combat attack against that model. However, that
model may attempt to make a single Reaction attack.
If this fighter is hit, use the distance they have moved
during this activation instead of their last activation to
determine the strength of the hit they take (see “I Get
Knocked Down…”).

**Quick Retreat:** A Mounted fighter may add a +2
modifier to their Initiative test when attempting to
perform a Retreat (Basic) action.

**Grounded:** A Mounted fighter cannot climb terrain
or vehicles.

**My Mount is my Life:** A Mounted fighter may have two
different Fighter cards even if they do not have the
Tools of the Trade special rule, in which case the only
difference allowed is the presence of their mount. A
fighter stranded in the wastes without their mount is in
dire trouble, and therefore a fighter can never become
separated from its mount mid-battle.

**“I Get Knocked Down…”:** A Mounted fighter does not
automatically become Prone and Pinned when hit by
a ranged attack. Instead, they immediately make an
Initiative test (applying a -1 modifier if they were hit by
a weapon with either the Blast (3"/5"/\*) or Knockback
traits). If this test is passed, the fighter does not
become Prone and Pinned but remains Standing and
Active. If this test is failed, they are Knocked Down.

When a Mounted fighter is Knocked Down, they
immediately suffer an automatic hit. The Strength, AP and Damage of this hit is determined by how far
the fighter moved during their last activation, rounded
up to the nearest inch:

| Distance Moved | Strength | AP  | Damage |
| :------------: | :------: | :-: | :----: |
|     0"-5"      |    3     |  -  |   1    |
|     6"-9"      |    5     | -1  |   1    |
|      10"+      |    7     | -2  |   2    |

After this hit has been resolved, the fighter changes
their status to Prone and Pinned. In order to perform the Stand Up (Basic) action, a Prone and Pinned
fighter subject to the Mounted condition must pass
an Initiative test. If this test is passed, the fighter
changes their status to Standing and Active. If this test
is failed, the action is wasted and they remain Prone
and Pinned.
