# First Principles

_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

In any game, there are certain conventions for all players to be aware of. In Necromunda, these include
such things as when players can or cannot measure distances, when it is acceptable to change one’s mind, and so forth.

## Fighters, Vehicles & Models

In games of Necromunda, players use finely-detailed
models to represent the fighters and vehicles of their
gangs on the battlefield. In game terms, it is sensible
to be quite precise in how such things are defined in
order that players can easily interpret the rules:

- Any model that represents a single humanoid or a single animal is referred to as a ‘fighter’ by the rules. This could be a lowly gang member, a renowned hired gun, or even an exotic beast owned by a mighty gang champion.
- Any model that is mounted on a single-person animal or bike is a fighter subject to the [Mounted condition](/docs/general-principles/conditions#mounted).
- Any model that represents a vehicle of any type, be it a small vehicle operated by a single driver or large vehicle crewed by many, is referred to as a ‘vehicle’ by the rules.
- Battlefield details such as a [Beast’s Lair](/docs/battlefield-setup/scenario-rules#the-beasts-lair) are never referred to as models but rather as markers.
- Where the rules use the terms ‘fighter’ or ‘vehicle’, they are referring specifically to models of that type. However, where the rules use the term ‘model’ or ‘models’, they are referring to both fighters and vehicles.

### Controlling & Opposing Player

Frequently, rules will refer to the controlling player – this is the player whose model is being affected; the opposing player is their opponent.

## Take-Backs & Changing One’s Mind

It is not uncommon for players of any game to secondguess themselves occasionally, saying they are about to
do something before immediately changing their mind. As a general rule, players should be tolerant of this in their opponents, as they will likely do it themselves!
However, once dice have been rolled for any reason, or
the range of a declared action measured, players must
abide by their decision; they can no longer go back and
change anything that came before the dice roll or the
act of measuring!
