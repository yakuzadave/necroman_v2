# Badzone: Industrial Terrain

## Service Hatches

#### Crawlways

When ending a Move (Simple) within 1" of a hatch, the fighter can be removed from the battlefield. In the End phase of the following round, make an Intelligence test:

- **Passed:** The controlling player must choose where to place
  the fighter.
- **Failed:** The opponent can choose where to place
  the fighter, or leave the fighter off the battlefield one more
  round (a new Intelligence test is made in the next
  End phase).

If returning to the battlefield, the fighter is placed standing within 1" of any other hatch anywhere on the battlefield (provided there is space, not within 1” of an enemy fighter and no overlapping other fighters’ bases or obstacles).

#### Improvised Cover

Make a Cover (Simple) action when within 1" of a hatch to gain partial cover. Any movement (voluntarily or otherwise) removes this benefit.

#### Hiding Place

When ending the movement within 1" of a hatch, the fighter can be removed from the battlefield. Place a marker next to the hatch to show that the fighter is hiding in it. While hiding, the fighter can't take actions or be targeted by ranged attacks from more than 3" away. Fighters may Engage and attack a fighter in hiding by moving or charging into base contact with the hiding place. If Engaged, place the hiding fighter on the battlefield in base contact with the fighter who Engaged them and conduct combat as normal.

In any End phase, the fighter may re-emerge from the hatch (provided there is space, not within 1” of an enemy fighter and no overlapping other fighters’ bases or obstacles).

## Promethium Pipes and Reservoirs

Any fighter hit by the Blast can pass an Initiative test to avoid being hit.

#### Fuel Slicks

While within 3”, Blaze weapons lose Scarce. Or, if the weapon doesn’t have Scarce, it gains Plentiful instead.

## Smokestacks

- ACTIVATE/DEACTIVATE (RANDOM, CONTROLLED)

#### Belching Smoke

If active, the area within 6” blocks line of sight.

#### Foul Air

If active, fighters may only make a single Move (Simple) action while within 6” (unless equipped with a respirator).

If active, Blaze weapons gain +1 Strength when hitting fighters within 6”.

## Industrial Claws and Hooks

- ACTIVATE/DEACTIVATE (CONTROLLED)

#### Quick Climbing

When within 3" of the line between the Claw (or where it connects to the structure) and the ground level, make the Climb (Simple) action to ascend or descend.

#### Death from Above

When within 3” of a Claw, make a Trigger Claw (Basic) action to drop the Claw on an enemy fighter on a lower level than the attacker and within 3" of the line between the Claw (or where it connects to the structure) and the ground level.

The attacked fighter must pass an Initiative test or take a S5 hit.

#### Hauling Cargo

When within 3" of a claw, make a Hook Cargo (Simple) action to lift either a Seriously Injured fighter or loot casket (or similar item that can be carried) up or down to any point within 3" of the Claw, provided that there is space to place the model.

## Plasma Pipes and Generators

- EXPLOSIVE

#### High Pressure Plasma

If hit, make the following test:

- Str + D6 > 8

If passed, it explodes using a plasma grenade:

Any fighter hit by the Blast can pass an Initiative test to avoid being hit.

#### Harsh Glow

Ignore Pitch Black rules within 6”. Infrasights and photo-goggles provide no benefit when targeting fighters within 3" of a Plasma Pipe or Generator.

## Plasma Canisters

- EXPLOSIVE

Counts as ammo caches for plasma weapons (pistol, gun, cannon and combi-weapons with a plasma component). May be moved in the same way as loot caskets. Any fighter in base contact may use it as plasma grenades with a -2 hit modifier (improvised weapons). Once used as an improvised weapon, remove it from the battlefield.
