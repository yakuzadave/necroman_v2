# The Priority Phase

_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

The Priority phase is split into the following steps:

1. Roll For Priority: Both players roll for Priority. 2. Ready Gang: Both players give each of their
   fighters and vehicles a Ready marker.

## 1. Roll For Priority

This step determines which player wins the Priority
marker for this round. The Priority marker is a coin or
token, such as that contained in the Necromunda: Hive
War boxed set, that is held by the player with Priority
for the round, acting as a reminder. Holding the Priority
marker gives a player a huge advantage, as they are
able to activate first and can dictate the flow of the
action during the round, often putting their opponent
onto the back foot and making their gang behave
reactively rather than proactively in response to their
foes moving and attacking first.

To determine who has Priority, each player rolls
a D6, and the player who rolls the highest takes
Priority for this round. In the case of a tie, the player
who had Priority in the previous round passes it to
their opponent. If the first Priority roll of the battle is
tied, neither player will have held Priority previously, therefore both players roll again.

## Priority In Multi-Player Games

Sometimes, more than two gangs find themselves
fighting on the same battlefield – either allying
together to take out hated foes, or in a bloody
free-for-all.

Players roll for Priority as normal, but ties are
handled differently. Players determine play order
based on their dice score when rolling for Priority. Any ties are re-rolled (for example, if four players
roll for Priority and score a 5, 4, 4 and 2, the player
that rolled 5 has Priority, the player that rolled 2
goes last and the players that each rolled a 4 roll
off again to determine who is going second and
third).

## 2. Ready Gang
During this step of the Priority phase, both players
place a Ready marker on each model (both fighters
and vehicles) in their gang that is currently on the
battlefield, note that some Conditions and Statuses
may prevent a model gaining a Ready marker. The
Necromunda: Hive War boxed set contains a number
of Ready markers that can be used for this. Ready
markers should be placed either on the model’s
Fighter card or Vehicle card or next to the model itself
on the battlefield. 

Once a model has been activated, its Ready marker is
removed. Under normal circumstances, a model that
is no longer Ready may not activate again, but players
should take note that there are some instances in
which a model may activate again, notably in the
case of some skills and gang tactics.
