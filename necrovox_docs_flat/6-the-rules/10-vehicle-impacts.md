# Vehicle Impacts

_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

There are several ways in which vehicles can impact other models, and even terrain. What happens when they do
depends upon the nature of the impact.

## Running Over Fighters

If a moving vehicle comes into contact with a
fighter’s base, the fighter is moved by the smallest
amount possible to allow the vehicle to pass, ensuring
the fighter does not end up within 1" of the vehicle. Once the vehicle’s movement has been completed, make an Initiative test for each Standing or Prone
and Pinned fighter moved in this way, applying a +1
modifier if the fighter was Standing. If the fighter is
Prone and Seriously Injured, they will only pass this test
on a natural roll of a 6.

If this test is passed, the fighter was able to dodge
safely aside. If, however, this test is failed, the fighter
suffers an automatic hit, and if Standing and Active
becomes Prone and Pinned. See the Vehicle Collision
Damage table to determine the power of the hit.

### Vehicle Collision Damage Table

There are many circumstances when a vehicle might
collide with another part of the battlefield, be it
another vehicle, a fighter or terrain. When this
happens use the Movement characteristic of the
moving vehicle on the table below to determine
the Strength, AP and Damage of the impact.

A vehicle that is Stationary and Stalled but has moved
as part of a Jump Start, Turn-over, Free Wheel action or
as a result of suffering a vehicle collision is assumed to
have a Movement characteristic of 3".

| Movement Characteristic | Strength | AP  | Damage |
| :---------------------: | :------: | :-: | :----: |
|          3"-5"          |    3     |  -  |   1    |
|          6"-7"          |    5     | -1  |   1    |
|          8"-9"          |    7     | -2  |   2    |
|          10"+           |    9     | -3  |   3    |

## Vehicle Collisions

There are two types of vehicle collisions: head-on
and side-on:

### Head-On Collisions

If, during the course of its movement, a vehicle’s Front
arc makes contact with any part of another vehicle, a
head-on collision has occurred. When this happens, compare the Toughness value of the impact arcs of the
two vehicles:

- If the Toughness of both vehicles is the same, or if
  the Toughness of the moving vehicle is greater, the
  impacted vehicle is pushed by the moving vehicle
  until it reaches the end of its movement.
- If the Toughness of the moving vehicle is lower, the
  active vehicle stops immediately.

### Side-On Collisions

If, during the course of its movement, a vehicle’s Side
arc makes contact with any part of another vehicle, a
side-on collision has occurred (generally this will be
either as the result of a failed Loss of Control test or a
vehicle turning). When this happens, make a Handling
test for the moving vehicle, applying a +1 modifier if its
Toughness in the impact arc is greater than that of the
other vehicle:

- If the test is passed, the impacted vehicle is moved
  by the smallest amount possible to allow the active
  vehicle to pass.
- If this test is failed, the active vehicle is turned
  by the smallest amount possible to allow it to
  continue moving.

### Colliding With Terrain

If a vehicle collides with a wall, an impassable or solid
terrain feature or a sturdy structure, it will likely come
off worse. In such cases, the vehicle is automatically
treated as if it had collided with a vehicle that has a
greater Toughness than it, whilst the terrain will suffer
no damage.

If a vehicle collides with an obstacle or a flimsy
structure, that terrain feature will be destroyed and is
removed from the battlefield. Any fighters on top of it
immediately fall. The vehicle itself is treated as having
collided with a vehicle that has a lower Toughness
than it.

### Vehicle Collision Damage

In either case, once the active vehicle has finished its
movement, both vehicles will suffer an automatic hit.
The Strength, AP and Damage of this hit is determined
by the [Vehicle Collision Damage table](/docs/the-rules/vehicle-impacts#vehicle-collision-damage-table). All
hits are resolved against the Toughness value of the
facing that suffers the hit.

If the Toughness of one of the vehicles is lower,
increase the Strength, AP and Damage of the hit
against it by 1. Applying damage to vehicles is
discussed later (see [Resolving Hits Against Vehicles](/docs/the-rules/resolve-hits-against-vehicles)).

### Chain Collisions

It is possible (some might even say likely!) that a
chain reaction of collisions may occur as vehicles
push each other into rocky outcrops and other
battlefield features.

When this happens, fully resolve the damage
from each collision in the order they occur. If
a subsequent collision occurs due to a vehicle
being pushed, use the initial vehicle’s Movement
characteristic when determining the power of
the impact.

Finally, if a vehicle stops due to impacting
impassable terrain or a vehicle with a higher
Toughness value then all the vehicles involved in
the collision stop.
