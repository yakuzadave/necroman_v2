# The Pre-Battle Sequence

_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

Prior to any battle, there are several important steps that need to take place, as
listed below. Some of these only apply during Campaign play, and can therefore be
skipped during Skirmish play, as mentioned in the appropriate entries. Whatever the
case, this sequence must be followed in the order shown, and must be done while
both players are present.

The pre-battle sequence consists of the following steps:

1. Make a Challenge & Stake Territory
2. Recruit Hired Guns
3. Determine Scenario
4. Set up the Battlefield
5. Choose Crews
6. Announce Territory Boons
7. Gang Tactics
8. Deployment

## 1. Make A Challenge & Stake Territory

For a battle to be fought, a challenge must be issued and accepted. In Campaign
play, challenges are handled as described by the Arbitrator, though campaigns will
provide guidance. In Skirmish play, a challenge is issued and accepted when two
players decide to play a battle.

In Campaign play, an eligible Territory is nominated as the stake for the battle (as
described in each campaign). This may be an as yet unclaimed Territory or a Territory
controlled by one of the players that their opponent wishes to seize control of – each
campaign will specify.

## 2. Recruit Hired Guns

Players can spend credits to recruit Hired Guns. In Campaign play, the gang may
spend credits from those it has in its Stash. In Skirmish play, any unspent credits
left over from creating the gang can be spent to recruit Hired Guns. Additionally, in
Campaign play, gangs may be able to recruit Hired Guns through other means, such
as House favours or as Boons granted by Territories.

If both players wish to recruit Hired Guns, the player with the lower Gang Rating may
do so first.

## 3. Determine Scenario

In Skirmish play, players may simply choose a scenario
they wish to play. If they cannot decide, they should
roll off to see who decides which scenario is played. In
Campaign play, the scenario may be determined by the
Arbitrator, though many campaigns include their own
Scenario table.

### Determining The Attacker & Defender

Many scenarios state that one gang is the attacker and
the other the defender. In Campaign play, the player
who issued the challenge is the attacker. In Skirmish
play, both players should roll a D6, with the player who
rolls the highest choosing who is the attacker and who
is the defender.

### Home Turf Advantage

The scenario being played may indicate that the
defender benefits from the [Home Turf Advantage](/docs/battlefield-setup/scenario-rules#home-turf-advantage), representing the gang fighting furiously to defend their
valuable turf from attackers. A gang fighting with the
Home Turf Advantage is far less likely to bottle out and in some cases will fight ferociously until the last.

### Rescue Mission

In Campaign play, it is not uncommon for fighters to
be taken [Captive by rival gangs](/docs/the-rules/the-post-battle-sequence#being-captured). If one
player has Captured a fighter belonging to a rival gang, the player that controls the gang the Captive belongs
to may issue a challenge to play the Rescue Mission
scenario. If the challenge is accepted, then the Rescue
Mission scenario is automatically used for the battle.
If the player holding the Captive refuses the challenge, they automatically forfeit the Captive. No Territory
is staked on this battle; the Captive is effectively the stake.

## 4. Set Up The Battlefield

The players now set up the battlefield. Some scenarios
have special instructions for terrain. The default methods are detailed in full in [Battlefield Set-up](/docs/battlefield-setup/battlefield-set-up).

## 5. Choose Crews

After the battlefield has been set up, before gangs
can be deployed, players must select their starting
crews for the battle ahead. The scenario being played
will detail the method of selection to be used, how
many and what kind of models can be selected. The
selection methods are explained in full in [Choosing Crews](/docs/battlefield-setup/scenario-rules#choose-crew).

## 6. Announce Territory Boons

In Campaign play, many of the territories grant a
‘Boon’ to the gang that controls them, and many
of these Boons will have an effect during a battle. Players should announce which, if any, of their Territory
Boons grant them a bonus that will have an effect on
the upcoming battle at this stage, forewarning their
opponent. If a Territory Boon is not announced, it
cannot be used during this battle.

In Skirmish play, this step of the pre-battle sequence
can be ignored.

## 7. Gang Tactics

Each scenario details how many gang tactics each
gang gets and how they are selected, with players
either choosing the gang tactics they want, or selecting
them at random, either by drawing cards from a
shuffled deck or by rolling on any Gang Tactics table
their gang is allowed to use (see [Gang Tactics](/docs/battlefield-setup/scenario-rules#gang-tactics)).

## 8. Deployment

The final step of the pre-battle sequence is
deployment, in which the players set their gangs up
on the battlefield, ready for the battle ahead. Many
scenarios will provide details of the size and location
of ‘deployment zones’, the name given to the areas in
which gangs can be set up. For those which do not, the
standard deployment rules can be found in [Deployment](/docs/battlefield-setup/scenario-rules#deployment).
