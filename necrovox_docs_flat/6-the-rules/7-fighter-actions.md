# Fighter Actions

_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

The following pages detail all of the core actions fighters may perform in
Necromunda. This list is by no means exhaustive, however, with skills, scenarios, special terrain features and more introducing further actions that fighters may perform.

## Standing Fighters

Standing fighters can perform a wide range of actions. The exact actions available to
them depend upon their Secondary Status: Active or Engaged.

## Standing & Active Fighters

Fighters that are Standing and Active are able to perform any of the following actions:

### Move (Simple)

The fighter may:

- Move a distance up to their Movement characteristic.
- [Climb](/docs/the-rules/terrain#climbing) vertically upwards or downwards.
- Cross any gap between two platforms that is no wider than their base.
- Attempt to [leap across a bigger gap](/docs/the-rules/terrain#leaping-gaps) provided that they have enough movement left to do so.
- Attempt to [jump down](/docs/the-rules/terrain#jumping-down) to a level below.

### Charge (Double)

The fighter moves as if making a Move (Simple) action, but adds
D3" to the distance they can move. A charging fighter can move to within 1" of one
or more enemy fighters that are Standing and either Active or Engaged, or that are
Prone and either Pinned or Seriously Injured, but if they do move to within 1" they
must have sufficient movement to get into base to base contact with at least one
enemy fighter. If they do not have sufficient movement to get into base to base
contact, they must stop 1" away. If they are Standing and Engaged at the end of this
move, they must immediately make a free Fight (Basic) action. If they are Standing
and Engaged with a Prone and Pinned fighter at the end of this move, that fighter
changes their status to Standing and Active.

### Crawl Through Ductway (Double)

If the fighter is within 1" of a ductway, they may be
placed within 1" of the other end of the ductway, provided they can be set up so that
they are not within 1" of an enemy fighter and so that their base does not overlap
that of another friendly model or an obstacle.

### Take Cover (Basic)

This fighter moves up to half their Movement characteristic and
is then Prone and Pinned.

### Shoot (Basic)

The fighter makes an attack with a ranged weapon – see [Shooting](/docs/the-rules/shooting).

### Aim (Basic)

If the fighter makes a subsequent Shoot (Basic) action this activation, apply a +1 modifier to any Hit rolls they make.

### Fire Through Ductway (Basic)

If this fighter is within
1" of a ductway, they may make a ranged attack
against an enemy model that is within 1" of the other
end of the same ductway. The attack will hit on a 5+, regardless of BS or modifiers. Weapons that normally
use a Flame template instead automatically hit all
models within 2" of the other end of the ductway.

:::tip YAQ
For Blasts, target a fighter within 1" of the ductway or any point within 1" of the ductway. Then roll to hit (5+) and scatter if it misses as normal.
:::

### Reload (Simple)

Pick one of the fighter’s weapons that
is Out of Ammo and make an Ammo test. If the test is
passed, the weapon is reloaded and the Out of Ammo
marker is removed.

### Reload Vehicle Weapon (Simple)

Pick a weapon with
the Passenger Operated trait mounted on a vehicle
within 1" that is Out of Ammo and make an Ammo test.
If the test is passed, the weapon is reloaded and the
Out of Ammo marker is removed.

### Coup de Grace (Simple)

If this fighter is not engaged
with any other fighters, choose one Prone and Seriously
Injured enemy fighter within 1" and within the vision
arc of this fighter. That enemy fighter immediately goes
Out of Action.

A fighter performing a Charge (Double) action may
make a free Coup De Grace (Simple) action instead of
a free Fight (Basic) action if they end their move within
1" of a Prone and Seriously Injured fighter and are not
engaged with any other enemy fighters.

:::tip YAQ
Do not make a 2nd Nerve test for fighters that became Seriously Injured and then taken Out of Action by a free Coup de Grace action in the same activation.
:::

### Operate Door (Simple)

Either open a closed door or
close an open door within 1" of this fighter.

### Access Terminal (Basic)

If this fighter is within 1" of
a door terminal, make an Intelligence test with a -2
modifier. If the test is passed, this fighter immediately
makes a free Operate Door (Simple) action on the door
that the terminal operates, regardless of their distance
from the door.

### Force Door (Basic)

If this fighter is within 1" of a
locked door, roll a D6 and add this fighter’s Strength, adding 2 for each friendly fighter that is also in base
contact with the door. If the total is 9 or more, the door
is opened.

### Smash Open Loot Casket (Basic)

If this fighter is
within 1" of a Loot Casket, roll a D6 and add their
Strength. If the total is 6 or more, the casket is opened. However, subtract 1 from the roll to determine the casket’s contents, to a minimum of 1 (see [Opening Loot Caskets](/docs/battlefield-setup/scenario-rules#opening-loot-caskets)).

### Bypass Loot Casket Lock (Basic)

If this fighter is
within 1" of a Loot Casket, make an Intelligence test for
this fighter. If the test is passed, the casket is opened.

### Carry Loot Casket (Simple)

If this fighter is within
1" of a Loot Casket, they may make a Move (Simple)
action, carrying the Loot Casket with them. When the
action ends, the casket is placed in base contact with
this fighter.

## Standing & Engaged Fighters

Fighters that are Standing and Engaged may only
perform the following actions:

### Fight (Basic)

The fighter makes close combat attacks against one or more enemy fighters they are engaged with (see [Close Combat](/docs/the-rules/close-combat)).

### Retreat (Basic)

Make an Initiative test for this
fighter. If it is passed, they can make a Move (Basic)
action, moving up to D6" instead of their Movement
characteristic. Regardless of the result of the Initiative
test, each enemy fighter that is engaged with them can
make an Initiative test. If they pass, they can make
Reaction attacks against the retreating fighter.

## Prone Fighters

Prone fighters are not able to perform as many actions
as Standing fighters. The exact actions available to
them depend upon their Secondary Status: Pinned
(face-up) or Seriously Injured (face-down).

## Prone & Pinned Fighters

Fighters that are Prone and Pinned are able to perform
any of the following actions:

### Stand Up (Basic)

For most fighters, quickly getting
back to their feet when they have been knocked
down is a priority. The fighter stands up, returning to
Standing and Active status. The controlling player can
choose the fighter’s facing.

### Crawl (Double)

Wanting to stay low, close to the
ground and hidden from enemy fire, the fighter crawls
along the ground. The fighter may move up to half of
their Movement characteristic.

### Blind Fire (Double)

Staying close to the ground, safely
hidden from the enemy by terrain or barricades, the
fighter fires blindly towards the enemy. The fighter
makes a ranged attack, treating their vision arc as
360°. Subtract 2 from the result of any Hit rolls.

### Reload (Simple)

(See previous Reload entry).

## Prone & Seriously Injured Fighters

Fighters that are Prone and Seriously Injured have
more pressing concerns than the battle that rages
around them. Often in considerable pain and usually
bleeding profusely, Prone and Seriously Injured fighters
are concerned primarily with making their way to
safety, away from their enemies. Therefore, Prone
and Seriously Injured fighters may only perform the
following action:

### Crawl (Double)

(See previous Crawl entry).

## Broken Fighters

Fighters can be subject to the [Broken condition](/docs/general-principles/conditions#broken). A Broken fighter is one that
has lost their nerve, a fighter that wants nothing more
than to get to a safe place where they can regain their
composure. Any fighter subject to the Broken condition
must perform a Running for Cover (Double) action
when activated.

### Running For Cover (Double)

If the fighter is Standing
and Active, they will move 2D6". If the fighter is Prone
and Pinned or Prone and Seriously Injured, they can
only move half of their Movement characteristic.

When a Broken fighter moves they must attempt to end
their move, in order of priority:

- So that they are more than 3" away from
  enemy models.
- So that they are out of line of sight of enemy models.
- In partial or full cover.
- As far away from any enemy models as possible.

If a Broken fighter is Standing and Engaged when
activated, they must make an Initiative test. If it is
passed, they must move as described previously. Each
enemy fighter that is engaged with them makes an
Initiative test and if passed, they can make Reaction
attacks before the Broken fighter is moved. If the
Broken fighter fails the Initiative test, they remain
engaged and can perform no further actions.
