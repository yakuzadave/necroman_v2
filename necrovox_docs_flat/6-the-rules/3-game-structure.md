# Game Structure

_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

A game of Necromunda is split into several rounds. During a round, players will
determine who has Priority, take turns activating one or more fighters or vehicles
and perform actions with them. They will attempt to recover injured fighters, repair
damaged vehicles, rally fleeing models and determine if their gang can hold its
nerve in the face of the enemy.

## Round Sequence

Each round is split into three phases, each in turn consisting of a number of steps
resolved one at a time. These are as follows:

### [Priority Phase](/docs/the-rules/the-priority-phase)

During the Priority phase:

1. Roll For Priority: Both players roll for Priority. 2. Ready Gang: Both players give each of their fighters and vehicles a
   Ready marker.

### [Action Phase](/docs/the-rules/the-action-phase)

During the Action phase:

1. Activate Gang: Starting with the player that holds Priority, players take turns to
   choose one of their Ready fighters or vehicles to activate.

### [End Phase](/docs/the-rules/the-end-phase)

During the End phase:

1. Bottle Checks: If a player has at least one Prone and Seriously Injured or
   Out of Action fighter, or at least one Wrecked vehicle, they will have to make a
   Bottle check for their gang. Often, passing this check is a formality, but as the
   casualties increase, failing a Bottle check becomes ever more likely!
2. Fleeing the Battlefield: If either gang has failed a Bottle check, the controlling
   player makes a Cool test for each of their models that is still on the battlefield. Any models that fail will flee the battlefield.
3. Recover & Restart: Starting with the player that holds Priority, both players
   make Recovery tests for any Prone and Seriously Injured fighters and/or
   Restart tests for any Stationary and Stalled vehicles belonging to their gang.
4. Rally Tests: Starting with the player that holds Priority, both players make Cool
   tests for Broken models belonging to their gang to see if they can Rally.
