# Movement

_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

During the Action phase, a number of actions allow a model to move in different ways, as detailed previously. Sometimes, a model may even be moved involuntarily as a result of an enemy attack or an in-game effect.
This section deals with how models are moved around the tabletop and how terrain can hinder their progress.

## Moving Models

All models, be they fighters or vehicles, move by
performing actions. For example, a fighter might
perform a Move (Simple) action to advance cautiously, or may perform two Move (Simple) actions in quick
succession to run forward and cover a lot more
ground. A fighter might Charge (Double) to get into
combat, or Crawl (Double) to get out of the firing line.

A model is not obliged to move its full Movement
allowance, it can move any distance up to its
Movement allowance, but it cannot move further. A fighter need not move in a straight line, vehicles
however are more restricted; a fighter can zigzag
around terrain as appropriate (though note that a
Charge (Double) action should take the shortest route
possible), whereas a vehicle can make a number
of turns based upon the action being performed. After moving, a fighter can turn to face any direction, whereas a vehicle’s facing will be determined by the
action it performed.

All actions that include movement must be declared
before any measuring is carried out. Sometimes, after a model’s declared movement is measured, it
may become obvious that it does not have as much
movement as hoped and will end its movement
short of where the controlling player had planned. In
this case, move the model as far as possible in the
desired direction, and try to make good use of any
available cover!

Note that, in the case of a fighter performing a
Charge (Double) action, if the fighter has insufficient
movement to make it into base to base contact with
an enemy fighter, they must still move the full distance
(stopping 1" away, as follows) and may often end their
movement in a very dangerous position!

Fighters can move (voluntarily) through friendly fighters (if having sufficient movement to not overlap any bases).

## The 1" Rule

Fighters cannot move to within 1" of an enemy fighter
during their activation, unless that enemy fighter is Prone
and Seriously Injured. Vehicles suffer no such restriction
and can move to within 1" of any enemy model during
their activation, as described on the opposite page.

The only exception to this rule is when a Standing and
Active fighter performs a Charge (Double) action, in
which case they may move to within 1" of one or more
enemy fighters, provided that they end their movement
in base to base contact with one or more enemy
fighters. If a fighter performing a Charge (Double)
action has sufficient movement to get within 1" of an
enemy fighter but does not have sufficient movement
to make it into base to base contact with the enemy
fighter, they must stop moving 1" away.

It may occur that a fighter is moved involuntarily to
within 1" of an enemy model. For example, a fighter
with the [Hurl](/docs/gang-fighters-and-their-weaponry/skills/#5-hurl) skill may throw an enemy fighter that
they are engaged with, which may result in that fighter
coming into contact with other fighters, friendly or
enemy. Should this happen, the normal rules described
previously are temporarily suspended until the
movement and any other effects it causes have been
fully resolved (such as in the previous Hurl example,
in which case the fighters would suffer hits as a result
of being thrown into contact with one another). Once
they have been, move the model that was involuntarily
moved by the shortest route possible until it is 1" away
from the enemy model.

## Directly Towards & Directly Away From

Sometimes, the rules will say that a model needs to
move directly towards another model. To do this, trace
an imaginary straight line that crosses through the centre
of each model – the moving model then moves towards
the other along this line the required distance. Similarly, to move directly away from another model, follow the
same method but move the moving model away.

As always, this cannot make a model move through a
solid terrain feature. Should a model contact a solid
terrain feature, it stops and does not move further


## Vehicles And Difficult Terrain

How a vehicle interacts with difficult terrain depends
upon how the vehicle moves. This will be indicated in
the vehicle’s rules, normally based on their type of Locomotion.

### Locomotion Special Rules

All vehicles must have a Locomotion special rule – this dictates how they interact with terrain. The four
Locomotive special rules are Skimmer, Tracked, Walker and Wheeled.

#### Wheeled

For every 1" a walker moves through difficult terrain, it counts as having moved 2".

#### Tracked

Ignore movement penalties when moving over difficult terrain.

#### Skimmers

Ignore all difficult & dangerous terrain. If ending an activation on difficult or dangerous terrain, pass a Handling test or suffer a Catastrophic hit to the Drive.

#### Walker

Make any amount of turns during an activation.

For every 1" a walker moves through difficult terrain, it counts as having moved 2".

### Vehicles And Dangerous Terrain

A vehicle may cross dangerous terrain in the same way
as difficult terrain. However to safely do so, a vehicle
must also pass a Handling check. If this check is
passed, the vehicle crosses the terrain safely. If it fails, a vehicle will suffer an immediate [Catastrophic Hit to its Drive](/docs/the-rules/resolve-hits-against-vehicles#drive-damage-table).

## Fighter Movement On Vehicles

In the ash wastes, gang members scramble over vehicles as they race along, engaging in rooftop fights and leaping from one vehicle to another.

To represent this, fighters treat vehicles like terrain for
the purposes of movement, climbing up the sides and
leaping onto them from gantries (though falling and
ending up Prone next to a vehicle is a very dangerous
position to be in).

However, trying to balance on the roof of a speeding
vehicle is a tricky proposition. Whenever a vehicle
moves, any fighters on it, except those on designated
transport spaces, must immediately pass an Initiative
check or fall. If they fall, place them 1" away from the
vehicle in a direction determined by the Scatter dice
after the vehicle has finished moving. If this causes
them to land within ½" of the edge of a platform, they
must test again to avoid falling. If it would cause them
to hit impassable terrain, move them the shortest
distance so as to be able to be placed. They only need
to test once during each vehicle’s activation, though
will also have to test if the vehicle they are on is moved
as part of a collision.

Note that objects such as Loot caskets will
automatically fall off a vehicle if not placed in a
designated transport area, unless it is in base contact
with a fighter which passes its Initiative check.
