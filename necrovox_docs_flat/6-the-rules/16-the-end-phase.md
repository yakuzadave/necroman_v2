# The End Phase

_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

After all models have been activated, the Action phase ends and play moves on to
the End phase. The End phase has four steps:

1. **Bottle Checks:** If a player has at least one Prone and Seriously Injured or Out of
   Action fighter, or at least one Wrecked vehicle, they will have to make a Bottle
   check for their gang.
2. **Fleeing the Battlefield:** If either gang has failed a Bottle check, that gang’s
   controlling player makes a Cool test for each of their models that is still on
   the battlefield. Any models that fail will flee the battlefield.
3. **Recover & Restart:** Starting with the player that holds Priority, both players make
   Recovery tests for any Prone and Seriously Injured fighters and/or Restart tests
   for any Stationary and Stalled vehicles belonging to their gang.
4. **Rally Tests:** Starting with the player that holds Priority, both players make
   Cool tests for Broken models belonging to their gang to see if they can Rally.

### Remove Temporary Effects

**Smoke:** Roll a D6 per smoke cloud: on a 1-4 it is removed.  
**Graviton Pulse:** Remove any Graviton Pulse blasts.  
**Toxic Sludge:** Roll a 2+ for each Prone fighter that is at least partially in a pool of toxic sludge, or go Out of Action.

## 1. Bottle Checks

At the start of the End phase, a player will be required to make a Bottle check for
their gang if one or more of their fighters are currently either Prone and Seriously
Injured or Out of Action, or if one or more of their vehicles is currently Wrecked.
If both players are required to make a Bottle check, the player that holds Priority
should go first.

To make a Bottle check for their gang, the controlling player rolls a D6 and adds
to the result the total number of fighters belonging to their gang that are currently
Prone and Seriously Injured or Out of Action and the total number of vehicles
belonging to their gang that are currently Wrecked. If the final result is higher than
the total number of models in its starting crew (the number of models that were present at the start of the battle, see [Choosing Crews](/docs/battlefield-setup/scenario-rules#choose-crew)), the Bottle check is failed and the
gang has ‘bottled out’. If the scenario uses Reinforcements, instead of comparing
to the number of models in its starting crew, compare the total to the number of
models that were eligible to take part in the battle.

Note that once a gang has bottled out, there is no need to make any further Bottle
check for it. It is considered to have bottled out for the remainder of the battle.

:::danger House Rule (A&A)

- Reinforcements count towards bottle tests.
- A voluntary fail automatically loses the match.

## 2. Fleeing The Battlefield

Once a gang has bottled out, both fighters and vehicles
alike may begin to flee the battlefield. During this step
of the End phase, starting with the gang that holds
Priority if both gangs have bottled out, the controlling
player makes a Cool test for each of their models that
is currently on the battlefield:

- If the test is passed, the model holds its nerve and
  remains on the battlefield.
- If the test is failed, the model chooses discretion
  over valour and it (or in the case of a vehicle,
  its crew) flees the battlefield.

What happens to a model when it flees the
battlefield will depend firstly upon whether it is a
fighter or a vehicle and, secondly, upon its current
Secondary Status:

1. Should a fighter flee the battlefield whilst their
   Secondary Status is Active, Engaged or Pinned, they are simply removed from play with no
   ill effect.
2. Should a fighter flee the battlefield whilst their
   Secondary Status is Seriously Injured, they are
   removed from play and set to one side. During
   the Wrap-up, test to see if they [succumb to their injuries](/docs/the-rules/the-post-battle-sequence#succumbing-to-injuries).
3. Should a vehicle flee the battlefield, the crew
   will abandon the vehicle and flee the battlefield, returning later to collect their vehicle. Change the
   vehicle’s Status to Stationary and Wrecked but do
   not roll on the Lasting Damage table.

### Voluntarily Fleeing The Battlefield

In the tense gang combat of Necromunda, it is often
wise for a gang to quit a fight while they are still ahead. This is especially true in ambushes, and when smaller
crews find themselves taking on larger and more
dangerous ones! Once at least one of a gang’s starting
crew is Prone and Seriously Injured, taken Out of
Action or are Wrecked, a gang’s controlling player can
choose to automatically fail any Bottle check the gang
is required to make.

Once a gang has bottled out (either voluntarily or
by failing a Bottle check), the controlling player can
declare that the gang will flee the battlefield at the
start of any Action phase. Any Standing and Active
or Prone and Pinned fighters, and all vehicles,
immediately flee the battlefield as described above. Engaged fighters must attempt to break away from
combat – make an Initiative test for each. If the test
is passed, they flee the battlefield. If the test is failed, they become Prone and Seriously Injured. Once
the gang that has declared that it will flee has only
Prone and Seriously Injured fighters remaining on the
battlefield, the battle ends. Roll to see if Prone and
Seriously Injured fighters succumb to their injuries in
the Wrap-up as usual.

### Gang Hierarchy

Some models, most notably Leaders and Champions, have a special rule called ‘Gang Hierarchy (X)’ listed
on their profile. In all such cases, the ‘X’ in brackets
will be replaced by the model’s rank (‘Leader’
or ‘Champion’):

**Gang Hierarchy (X):** During a battle, once this model’s
gang has failed a Bottle check, during any End phase
in which this model passes its Cool test and does not
flee the battlefield, any friendly models that are within
12" (if this model is a Leader) or 6" (if this model is a
Champion) of this model will automatically pass their
Cool test and will not flee the battlefield.

## 3. Recover & Restart

Starting with the player that holds Priority, both players
make Recovery tests for any Prone and Seriously
Injured fighters belonging to their gang to see if they
recover sufficiently to return to the fight. Similarly, both
players make Restart tests for any Stationary and
Stalled vehicles belonging to their gang to see if they
can be restarted and become Mobile once again.

### Recovery Tests

For each member of their gang that is Prone and
Seriously Injured and still on the battlefield, the
controlling player makes a Recovery test by rolling an
Injury dice:

- If the result is Out of Action, the fighter is removed
  from play.
- If the result is Seriously Injured, the fighter suffers a
  Flesh Wound and remains as they are – Prone and
  Seriously Injured.
- If the result is a Flesh Wound, the fighter suffers a
  Flesh Wound and becomes Prone and Pinned.

**Assistance:** When making a Recovery test for a Prone
and Seriously Injured fighter, one Standing and Active
friendly fighter that is within 1" can offer assistance.
If they do so, roll one extra Injury dice then pick one
of the Injury dice to resolve and discard the other.
In addition, a fighter that is being assisted does not
suffer a Flesh Wound regardless of the result of the
Injury dice.

A fighter can only assist one Recovery test per
End phase.

**Multiple Injury Dice:** It may happen that, due to
assistance, items of Wargear, Tactics cards or skills
that, when making a Recovery test, several Injury dice
are rolled. Regardless of how many are rolled, one
Injury dice is picked and resolved – the others are
discarded, as described previously.

### Restart Tests

For each vehicle belonging to their gang that is
currently Stationary and Stalled, the controlling player
makes a Restart test. To make a Restart test, make
a Handling test for the vehicle, applying a +1 modifier
unless the vehicle has only 1 HP remaining:

1. If the Handling test is passed, the vehicle
   immediately Restarts, changing its Status from Stationary and Stalled to Mobile.
2. If the Handling test is failed, the vehicle refuses
   to Restart and it remains Stationary and Stalled.

### Wounded Drivers

Finally during this step, if any vehicles in a player’s
gang have suffered a Driver Wounded damage effect,
a D6 is rolled for that driver, as described in [Crew Damage Table: Drive Wounded](/docs/the-rules/resolve-hits-against-vehicles#crew-damage-table).

## 4. Rally Tests

During the final step of the End phase, players may
attempt to Rally any Broken models belonging to their
gang, starting with the gang that holds Priority if both
gangs contain Broken models.

To Rally a Broken model, make a Cool test for them, applying a +1 modifier to the result for each friendly
model within 3" of them that is not Broken and is not
Prone and Seriously Injured:

- If the test is passed, the model is no longer Broken.
- If the test is failed, the model remains Broken and
  may attempt to Rally again in the next End phase.

:::note Flooded Passage (Special Terrain Feature)
At the end of each End phase, roll 2+ for each Seriously Injured fighter in the Flood Water or they are taken Out of Action (their injuries are too great to keep their head above water).
:::

:::note Badzone Environments
If using Badzone Environments, roll to see if the current is discarded. If discarded, generate a new Event.

Leading by Example is not affected by any status or condition (Broken, Seriously Injured, Blaze etc.)
