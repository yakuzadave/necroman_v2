# Psykers

_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

_On Necromunda, there are few individuals as dangerous to Lord Helmawr’s dominion as the psyker._

_These powerful individuals represent a rare mutation within humanity – they are able to channel the esoteric power of the Warp with a thought and bend reality to their will. Since Mankind first ventured out into the void, the number of psykers being born has steadily grown, though at a terrible cost to the genetic stock of Mankind. For each one that comes into the world, millions of mutants are also born, as if nature itself were toying with biology in an effort to force Mankind to evolve. As the 41st Millennium draws to a close, psykers and mutants fill every corner of the galaxy, moving amongst humanity unnoticed or lurking in the shadows of cities and hives._

## Psychic Powers

Psykers are a distinct type of fighter who are able
to manifest strange and powerful abilities, bringing
death, destruction and worse to the gang wars of the
underhive. During a battle, psykers are activated just
like any other fighter, with the exception that they may
perform ‘Wyrd Power (X)’ actions, which enable them
to manifest their abilities.

A Wyrd Power (X) action may be (Simple), (Basic) or
(Double), depending upon the complexity of the Wyrd
Power the psyker is attempting to manifest. This will
always be shown in brackets after the name of the
Wyrd Power itself. When a psyker is activated, they may
choose to perform one or more Wyrd Power (X) actions.

Wyrd Powers are named by discipline first, such as
Telekinesis – the power to manipulate and move
objects, and as a unique effect second, such as
Force Blast – the power to push enemies back with
a thought. Most psykers follow one discipline closely, though it is not uncommon for a psyker to possess
abilities drawn from two or more different disciplines. Regardless of the Wyrd Power(s) that a psyker knows, all psykers are able to perform the following actions:

**Maintain Control (Simple):** In order to maintain
a Continuous Effect (as follows), the psyker must
perform this action. If they do not, the Continuous
Effect expires at the end of this fighter’s activation. The
psyker immediately makes a Willpower test with a +3
modifier – if the test is passed then the power remains
in effect until their next activation; if failed, the power
ends immediately.

If they wish, the psyker may instead choose to make
this action for free at the start of their activation –
if they do so then they do not add any bonuses to
their Willpower test and may not attempt to manifest
another Wyrd Power this activation regardless of
whether or not the Willpower test is successful.

**Concentrate (Basic):** If the fighter makes a Willpower
test in their subsequent action, add 1 to the result of
the dice roll.

## Using Wyrd Powers

When a psyker makes a Wyrd Power (X) action, they
must make a Willpower test to see if the action is
successful. If the test is passed, the Wyrd Power takes
immediate effect. If it is failed, the Wyrd Power has no
effect and the action is wasted.

Some Wyrd Power (X) actions are noted as being a
Continuous Effect. Such a power lasts from when the
psyker performs the action until the end of their next
activation when it will expire, unless they perform a
Maintain Control (Simple) action during their activation,
in which case the Continuous Effect remains in play
for another round. A psyker can only ever have one
Continuous Effect in play. If a psyker is Prone and
Seriously Injured or taken Out of Action, any of their
Continuous Effects will immediately expire.

However, using Wyrd Powers is not without risk. If the
Willpower test is failed on the roll of a double 1, the
psyker must immediately roll on the [Perils of the Warp
table](/docs/the-rules/psykers#perils-of-the-warp). If the Willpower test is passed
on the roll of a double 6, the Wyrd Power takes effect,
cannot be Disrupted (see [Psychic Duels](/docs/the-rules/psykers#psychic-duels)) and the psyker must immediately roll on the Perils of the Warp table.

## Psychic Duels

Whenever a psyker is activated to make a Wyrd Power (X) action or to make a
Maintain Control (Simple) action, if there is a Standing and Active or Prone and
Pinned enemy psyker within 18", they may attempt to Disrupt the psyker’s successful
Wyrd Power.

To Disrupt a successful Wyrd Power (X) action, a psyker must roll 2D6. If the total is
higher than the total rolled for the Willpower test made to successfully perform the
action, the Wyrd Power is Disrupted and fails as if the psyker making the action had
failed their own Willpower test. If the total is equal to or lower than the total of the
Willpower test made to successfully perform the action, the Disruption attempt fails
and the Wyrd Power (X) action is resolved.

However, Disruption attempts can be just as risky as manifesting psychic powers. If a
double 6 is rolled, the Wyrd Power is cancelled, but the psyker making the Disruption
attempt must immediately roll on the Perils of the Warp table. If a double 1 is rolled, the Disruption attempt fails and the psyker making the Disruption attempt must
immediately roll on the Perils of the Warp table.

## Perils Of The Warp

Whenever a psyker rolls a double 1 or a double 6 when making a Willpower test to
perform a Wyrd Power (X) action, or when attempting to Disrupt a Wyrd Power, roll
2D6 and consult the table below:

|  2D6  | Result                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| :---: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  2-3  | **A Tear in Reality!:** The psyker loses control and warp energy tears reality apart around them. Centre a 5" Blast marker on the psyker; any model touched by the marker must pass a Willpower test or lose a Wound or suffer the [Driver Wounded effect](/docs/the-rules/resolve-hits-against-vehicles#crew-damage-table). The psyker then goes Out of Action.                                                                                                                                                                   |
|  4-5  | **Immaterium Inverse:** The Warp inverts upon those attempting to control it. The psyker becomes the target of the power (regardless of range). If the power is beneficial, the psyker instead becomes Prone and Pinned and suffers a Strength 6 hit that inflicts 2 Damage, ignoring armour saves, and the power has no other effects.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|  6-8  | **Whispers from the Warp:** The psyker’s mind is filled with screaming daemonic voices. The psyker becomes subject to the Insane condition. Place an Insanity marker on the psyker’s Fighter card and roll a D6 on the [Insane table](/docs/general-principles/conditions#insane) when they activate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 9-10  | **Warp Surge!:** The psyker’s power becomes overcharged with warp energy. The psyker may immediately try to manifest the same power again as a free action, or, if they were trying to Disrupt a power, they may immediately manifest one of their own powers as a free action – this additional manifestation of the power can trigger Perils of the Warp as normal. After working out the effects of the power, the psyker becomes Prone and Pinned and suffers a Strength 4 hit which inflicts 1 Damage, ignoring armour saves. |
| 11-12 | **Daemonic Possession:** Daemonic energy courses through the psyker’s body. The psyker increases their Movement, Strength, Toughness and Attacks characteristics all by 3 and their Weapon Skill to 2+. Their unarmed attacks inflict 2 Damage and have an AP of -1. In the End phase of the following round, or if the psyker generates this result again, they go Out of Action.                                                                                                                                                 |

If the first action causes Insanity, apply Insanity immediately if the fighter makes a 2nd action.

## Sanctioned and Non-Sanctioned Psykers

All psykers fall into two broad types, regardless of
the powers they wield or where they originate from:
sanctioned psykers and non-sanctioned psykers. Bearing the official approval of Imperial authorities, sanctioned psykers wield their powers under the
control and vigilance of overseers and handlers. Trained from an early age in the correct use of their
abilities and to minimise the risks of daemonic
possession, sanctioned psykers are free to operate as
they wish without the risk of censure by the authorities. A non-sanctioned psyker, by contrast, exists outside of
the system and in secret, unaware of the great risks
they present to themselves and others, and oblivious
to the great efforts the Imperium goes to in controlling
their kind. The rewards for bringing a non-sanctioned
psyker to Imperial justice can be great, often significant
enough to justify the risks of going against them!

To reflect their sanctioned or unsanctioned status, all psykers will have one of the two following skills
on their profile:

**Sanctioned Psyker:** A psyker with this skill may re-roll a
failed Willpower test once per battle.

**Non-sanctioned Psykers:** Should a psyker with this skill
be taken Out of Action, the enemy gang is rewarded
a bounty of D3x10 credits at the end of the battle. Should a psyker with this skill be captured and sold
to the Guilders, they are worth their full value. Note
that when a psyker with this skill is captured, they
can be sold immediately without the opportunity for a
Rescue Mission.

## Wyrd Powers And The Firepower Dice

Some Wyrd powers act as weapons that can be
used by the psyker, however these powers can
never run Out of Ammo. Therefore there is no need
to roll a Firepower dice when attacking with a Wyrd
power unless the attack has a Trait that triggers
certain results on the Firepower dice.

## Wyrd Powers

There are many ways that a fighter may gain access
to Wyrd Powers – one of the most common being
the use of Ghast. Presented below are a selection of
Wyrd Powers for players and Arbitrators to use in their
campaigns. If a fighter gains a Wyrd Power, they may
either roll a D6 to see which power they gain or in
some cases may choose one of the following powers.

:::tip

Below you will find the Wyrd Powers listed in the 2023 Core Rules. These were greatly expanded upon in the Book of the Outcast and can be found in [Wyrd Powers](/docs/the-rules/wyrd-powers). Most campaigns will use the extended powers list, but check with your arbitrator if uncertain.

:::

### 1. Telekinesis – Assail (Basic)

_With a grunt, the wyrd pushes a person or an object away._

Target a single
enemy fighter or obstacle that is both within 12" and
line of sight of this fighter and make a hit roll, using
this fighter’s Ballistic Skill. If a hit is scored, move the
target D3" in any direction – if they were Standing, they
become Prone and Pinned after moving. If they come
into base contact with a Standing fighter or any terrain, they stop moving and suffer a S3, AP -, D1 hit. If they
come into base contact with another Standing fighter, that fighter also suffers a S3, AP -, D1 hit and becomes
Prone and Pinned.

### 2. Pyromancy – Flame Blast (Basic), Continuous Effect

_Flames envelop one of the wyrd’s weapons, causing anything touched by it to similarly burst into fire._

While this Wyrd Power is maintained, one weapon
with the Melee or Versatile trait carried by this fighter
gains the Blaze trait.

### 3. Chronomancy – Freeze Time (Double)

_Reality seems to thicken all around the fighter, and events slow down to a crawl – has time truly stopped, or are those caught in the power merely experiencing its flow differently?_

All fighters, friend and foe, within 12"
of this fighter may only perform a single action when
activated for the remainder of this round.

### 4. Technomancy – Weapon Jinx (Simple)

_With a snap of their fingers, the wyrd causes an enemy’s weapon to malfunction._

Choose an enemy fighter that is within
18" of this fighter. That enemy fighter must immediately
make an Ammo test for one of their weapons, chosen
by this fighter’s controlling player.

### 5. Telepathy – Terrify (Double)

_Planting a horrific image in an enemy’s mind, the wyrd tries to break their spirit._

Choose a single enemy fighter that is both
within 18" and line of sight of this fighter. That fighter
must immediately take a Nerve test with a -3 modifier
applied to the roll or becomes Broken.

### 6. Biomancy – Quickening (Basic), Continuous Effect

_The wyrd pours psychic energy into their muscles, greatly increasing their reflexes._

While this Wyrd Power is maintained, improve this fighter’s Movement
characteristic by 3 and their Weapon Skill, Ballistic
Skill and Initiative characteristics by 1 (to a maximumof 2+).
