# The Post-Battle Sequence

Following any battle, there are several important steps that need to take place, as listed below. Some of these only apply during Campaign play, and can therefore be skipped during Skirmish play, as mentioned in the
appropriate entries. Whatever the case, this sequence must be followed in the order shown, and must be done
while both players are present.

The post-battle sequence has seven steps:

1. Wrap-up
2. Assign/Reassign Territory
3. Receive Rewards
4. Collect Income
5. Post-battle Actions
6. Update Roster
7. Report Results

## 1. Wrap-Up

During the Wrap-up, each player checks to see
whether any fighters that were Prone and Seriously
Injured when the battle ended, or that fled from the
battlefield whilst Prone and Seriously Injured, succumb
to their injuries, as described as follows. Additionally, during the Wrap-up players determine whether any
fighters captured by the enemy manage to escape, as described as follows, after which any vehicles that
were abandoned by fleeing crew (as described as
follows) are retrieved.

Finally, during a battle fought as part of a campaign, it
is at the end of the Wrap-up that fighters that were In
Recovery are considered to have made a full recovery, and their In Recovery box on the gang roster is cleared.

Players should note that any other events that take
place ‘at the end of the battle’ will also take place
during the Wrap-up.

### Succumbing To Injuries

If a fighter is Prone and Seriously Injured when the
battle ends, or if a fighter belonging to a gang that had
bottled out fled from the battlefield whilst Prone and
Seriously Injured, roll a D6 for them during the Wrapup. On a 3 or more, they survive without any further
complications, but on a 1 or 2 they succumb to the
injuries suffered during the battle and are treated as
having gone Out of Action. A Lasting Injury roll is made
for them, as described previously.

### Being Captured

After the battle there is a chance that any fighters who
have been captured by the opposing gang may be able
to slip away while being taken away:

**Capturing Enemy Fighters:** Roll a D6 for each friendly
fighter that suffered a Captured result (55-56) on the
Lasting Injury chart and apply the below modifiers:

- -1 if the battle was a draw.
- -2 if the fighter’s gang lost the battle.
- -2 if the fighter was taken Out of Action while subject to the Webbed condition.

If the result is 4+ then the fighter successfully escapes
their bonds before being dragged away and goes into
Convalescence (a natural roll of a 6 always results in
the captive escaping). Otherwise the fighter has been
Captured – make a note in the Lasting Injury/Captured
By box on the gang roster for the Captured fighter, recording the name of the gang who has Captured
the fighter.

### Claiming Scrap

If only one gang has models left on the battlefield
at the start of the Wrap-up, they will grab what they
can from Wrecked enemy vehicles before leaving the
battlefield. That gang adds D3x10 credits to their Stash
for each Wrecked enemy vehicle on the battlefield. The
Wrecked vehicles are then reclaimed by their gang.

### Captive Fighters

Whilst a fighter is Captured, they are said to be a
‘Captive’. That fighter is unavailable for battles and
post-battle actions as if they were In Recovery. This
lasts until that fighter is recovered (as follows), rather
than for just one battle. The Capturing gang should
make a note in their Stash of the fighter they now
hold Captive.

When a fighter is Captured, their gang has a chance
to rescue them. The Captured fighter’s controlling
player may issue a challenge to the gang that holds
their fighter Captive to play a Rescue Mission. This
supersedes the usual challenge process and the
[Determine Scenario step](/docs/the-rules/the-pre-battle-sequence#3-determine-scenario) of the pre-battle sequence – instead, the Rescue Mission scenario is played.

If a gang does not wish to attempt to rescue a Captive, or if the rescue attempt fails:

- A Law Abiding gang may claim a bounty on a [Captive fighter](/docs/the-rules/the-post-battle-sequence#captive-fighters) belonging to an Outlaw gang during the post-battle sequence of that battle.
- An Outlaw gang may ‘dispose’ of a Captive fighter
  belonging to any gang during the post-battle
  sequence of that battle.
- Any gang may trade a Captive back to the gang
  it belongs to or to any other gang that wants the
  Captive, as described as follows.
- Any gang may [sell a Captive to the Guilders](/docs/the-rules/the-post-battle-sequence#sell-to-the-guilders) as a slave during the post-battle sequence of that battle.

If the Captive is still held the next time the two gangs
face each other, the controlling player of the gang
the Captive belongs to once again has the option to
declare that their gang will attempt a Rescue Mission.

### Trading Captive Models

At any time during a campaign, regardless of whether
a Rescue Mission has been attempted, the two gangs’ controlling players can come to an agreement to make
a trade to secure a Captive’s return. Additionally, once
a Rescue Mission has been attempted and failed, the
gang that holds the Captive is free to trade it to any
gang they wish.

This trade could be a payment of credits, a trade for
another Captive, a valuable item of equipment, even
surrendering a Territory, or anything else – it is entirely
up to the two players to decide and either gang is free to
decline an offer made by the other. If an agreement is
reached, the Captive is transferred to the gang that the
trade was made with. If the Captive is returned through
a trade to the gang it belongs to, they immediately
become available to the gang once more.

## 2. Assign/Reassign Territory

The player that won the battle takes control of the
Territory staked on the battle. In the case of a draw
while fighting for control of an uncontrolled Territory, the Territory is not claimed by either player. In the
case of a draw during the Takeover phase when a
controlled Territory is at stake, the Territory does not
change hands.

## 3. Receive Rewards

Each scenario shows a list of rewards which the gangs
can receive, based on their performance during the
battle. Any equipment gained is added to the gang’s
Stash – it can be distributed to fighters in step 6.

:::danger House Rule (A&A)

Scenario Rewards are capped at 4D6 (x10 Credits). this means you cannot roll more than 4 D6 dice when determining your rewards, rather than making a separate roll to determine your reward cap.

:::

### Gaining And Losing Reputation

Most scenarios contain a number of ways in which a
gang can gain or lose Reputation. If a gang both gains
and loses Reputation, any gains are applied before
any losses.

## 4. Collect Income

Each gang collects income from each Territory they
control that generates income, as detailed for that
Territory. The total amount of credits generated
from each gang’s Territories is then added to the
gang’s Stash.

## 5. Post-Battle Actions

During a campaign, each fighter in the gang that has
the Gang Hierarchy (X) special rule can make one
post-battle action. Each of these actions is carried
out one at a time, in an order of the controlling
player’s choice. Fighters who are In Recovery, or who
have been Captured, cannot make post-battle actions. Unless otherwise stated, the same action can be
made more than once. The actions below are always
available, but others might also become available
through special Territories, skills or other means.

### Trade

The fighter can visit the Trading Post by making a
Trade action – this action is resolved during the
[Visit the Trading Post step](/docs/the-rules/the-post-battle-sequence#b-visit-the-trading-post) of the post-battle sequence. The availability of Rare and Illegal
items available at the Trading Post is influenced by
whether it is a Law-abiding or Outlaw gang visiting.

### Sell To The Guilders

The fighter can sell any number of Captive fighters to the Guilders – as long as the Captive’s gang has had a [chance to rescue them](/docs/the-rules/the-post-battle-sequence#captive-fighters):

Each Captive fighter is worth half of their total Cost
(50%) when sold as a slave (including all weapons
and Wargear), rounding up to the nearest 5 credits – add these credits to this gang’s Stash. The Captive
fighter’s controlling player should be informed as soon
as possible, and must delete the Captive fighter fromtheir roster. All weapons and equipment owned by the
fighter are sold along with them, they do not go into any
gang’s Stash.

### Claim Bounties

Law Abiding gangs can
[claim bounties](/docs/the-rules/the-post-battle-sequence#claim-bounties) for any enemy fighters belonging to
Outlaw gangs that they have Captured (providing the
Captive’s controlling player has had the opportunity to
attempt a Rescue Mission, as described in [Captive Fighters](/docs/the-rules/the-post-battle-sequence#captive-fighters)). The bounty for a Captive fighter is equal to that fighter’s full Cost – this many credits are added to this
gang’s Stash. The Captive fighter’s controlling player
should be informed as soon as possible, and must
delete the Captive from their roster

### ‘Dispose’ Of Captives

As described in [Captive Fighters](/docs/the-rules/the-post-battle-sequence#captive-fighters), Outlaw gangs can dispose
of any enemy fighters they have captured, providing the
Captive’s controlling player has had the opportunity to
attempt a Rescue Mission. How the fighter is disposed
of varies depending upon the type of gang in question. Some captives are sacrificed in dark rituals, others
are eaten, and yet more simply disappear. Whatever
the case, the Captive’s controlling player should be
informed as soon as possible that their fighter has
been disposed of, and must delete that fighter from
their roster.

### Medical Escort

The fighter escorts a critically injured fellow gang
member to the Doc. Select one other fighter or crew in
the gang that suffered a Critical Injury during the battle
and pay 2D6x10 credits from the gang’s Stash. If the
gang does not have sufficient funds, or does not wish
to pay the full amount, no roll is made and the fighter
or crew dies. Otherwise, roll a D6 on the table below:

| D6  | Result                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| :-: | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  1  | **Complications:** The fighter dies.                                                                                                                                                    |
| 2-5 | **Stabilised:** Roll on the Lasting Injury table, re-rolling any results of Captured, Critical Injury or Memorable Death. Apply the result, in addition the fighter goes into Recovery. |
|  6  | **Full Recovery:** The fighter goes into Recovery, but suffers no lasting effects.                                                                                                      |

### Negotiate Repairs

The fighter accompanies the crew of a vehicle that has
suffered Lasting Damage to the Chop Shop. Select one
vehicle in the gang that has sustained Lasting Damage
and roll a D6 on the table below to determine the cost
of repairs. If the gang wishes to meet this cost, it pays
with credits from its Stash and all Lasting Damage
previously sustained is removed from the vehicle. If the
gang does not have sufficient funds, or does not wish
to pay the amount, the vehicle is not repaired and the
Lasting Damage it has sustained is not removed:

| D6  | Result                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| :-: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1-3 | **Almost Like New:** The repairs cost a quarter (25%), rounding up to the nearest 5 credits, of the vehicle’s Cost (including Upgrades but not including Wargear and weapons), but the vehicle isn’t quite the same. Replace all Lasting Damage the vehicle has previously sustained with a Persistent Rattle. |
| 4-5 | **Quality Repairs:** The repairs cost a quarter (25%), rounding up to the nearest 5 credits, of the vehicle’s Cost (including Upgrades but not including Wargear and weapons).                                                                                                                                 |
|  6  | **Superficial Damage:** The repairs cost a tenth (10%), rounding up to the nearest 5 credits, of the vehicle’s Cost (including Upgrades but not including Wargear and weapons).                                                                                                                                |

## 6. Update Roster

During this step of the post-battle sequence, gangs can
dispose of dead and injured fighters, scrap damaged
vehicles, purchase new equipment and models, and more. During this step, players should follow
this sequence:

A. Clean House  
B. Visit the Trading Post  
C. Gain Boons from Territories  
D. Distribute Equipment  
E. Purchase Advancements  
F. Update Gang Rating

### A. Clean House

After any battle, a gang is likely to have dead fighters
to dispose of, injured fighters to retire, and wrecked
vehicles to sell for scrap. This process is generally
referred to as ‘cleaning house’.

Dead fighters or vehicle crew are simply deleted from
the roster. If their gang had at least one fighter on the
battlefield at the end of the battle, or if the fighter was
taken to the Doc but still died, all of their equipment
(except for armour) is added to the gang’s Stash. Otherwise, the dead fighter’s equipment is lost. If they
were crew, their vehicle is added to the gang’s Stash
and can be given to a new crew.

Also at this point, the controlling player can choose
to retire fighters or vehicle crews – usually because
Lasting Injuries have rendered them unfit for battle. These fighters are deleted from the roster, and their
equipment is added to the gang’s Stash. Equipment in
the gang’s Stash can be sold or transferred to a new
fighter in the next step. If they were crew, their vehicle
is added to the gang’s Stash and can be given to a
new crew.

Finally, the controlling player can choose to scrap any
vehicles that have sustained Lasting Damage. A vehicle
is worth a quarter of its total Cost (25%) rounded
up to the nearest 5 credits (including Upgrades but
not including Wargear and weapons) when sold as
scrap. These credits are added to the gang’s Stash. When a vehicle is scrapped, any Upgrades it had are
lost, though its Wargear and weapons are added to
the gang’s Stash. The crew must be either given a
new vehicle, one must be purchased for them or they
are retired.

### B. Visit The Trading Post

The gang can visit the Trading Post to spend its hardearned credits in any of the ways described below, allowing them to hire new fighters and buy or sell
equipment. The actions can be made in any order and, unless specified, there is no limit to how many times
a gang can perform each one. Any spent credits are
deducted from the gang’s Stash; any gained credits
are added to the gang’s Stash.

**Hire a Fighter:** The gang can hire a new fighter or crew
from its House List, paying for them as they did when
founding the gang. No equipment is purchased for this
fighter or crew – they receive equipment in a later step.

Note that, when hiring new fighters or crew, the Gang
Composition rules and any restrictions detailed in the
gang list must be honoured.

**Purchase a Vehicle:** The gang can purchase any new
vehicle from its House List, paying for it as they did
when founding the gang. No Upgrades are purchased
for this vehicle – it receives Upgrades in a later step.

**Recruit Hangers-on & Brutes:** The gang can spend
credits to add a Hanger-on or a Brute to their roster. Their Reputation must be sufficient to allow this.

**Sell Unwanted Items:** Any items in the gang’s Stash
can be sold. The item is deleted from the Stash, and
the gang gains its value in credits, minus D6x10 (to a
minimum of 5 credits).

Note that equipment granted as a Territory Boon
cannot be sold during the same post-battle sequence.

**Purchase Equipment:** Equipment can be purchased
for any model from its own Equipment List at the price
shown (this cannot be added to the gang’s Stash
during this post-battle sequence). A gang can purchase
Common equipment from the Trading Post, at the price
shown, adding it to its Stash. This action cannot be
used to purchase Rare or Illegal equipment.

**Seek Rare & Illegal Equipment (Trade Post-battle Action Only):** This action can only be performed if a
fighter has made a Trade post-battle action, is only
performed once and is done to determine the availability
of Rare and Illegal items on offer at the [Trading Post](/docs/armoury/). Roll 2D6 to determine the availability
of items, adding the following bonuses:

- +2 if the gang’s Leader is making a Trade post- battle action.
- +1 for each Champion making a Trade post- battle action.
- +1 for every full 10 Reputation the gang has.
- +/-X as from a specified special rule.
  - A Law-abiding gang may purchase equipment from
    the Trading Post that is Rare (X) where X is equal to or
    less than the Availability level and may purchase items
    that are Illegal (X) where X is equal to or less than the
    Availability level -4.
  - An Outlaw gang may purchase equipment from the
    Trading Post that is Rare (X) or Illegal (X) where X is
    equal to or less than the Availability level.

Note that Exclusive items may not be purchased from
the Trading Post, only from gang Equipment Lists.

### The Black Market, Rarity And Legality Ratings

Older publications may reference the Black Market,
treat any of those abilities as referencing the
Trading Post instead. Additionally, they may
reference Rarity or Legality ratings – in these
cases replace them with Rare (X) and Illegal (X). For example, a Rarity rating of 8 becomes Rare (8).

:::

:::info

### Post-Battle Actions Timings

Much as players may wish otherwise, sometimes
there isn’t always time after a battle to fully resolve
all the post-battle actions – when this occurs there
are a couple of different options. Some players like
to roll everything in front of their opponent and
then go away and decide exactly how to spend
their credits and XP, while others prefer to resolve all
these in the pre-battle sequence of their next battle.

In the end, these options all work as long as both
players and the Arbitrator (in Campaign play) agree.

:::

### C. Gain Boons From Territories

Some Territories grant a gang Boons in the form
of additional recruits, Hangers-on or equipment.
Any available Boons the gang wishes to claim are
claimed now.

### D. Distribute Equipment

Any equipment currently held in the gang’s Stash can
now be distributed among its models. Weapon choices
must respect any restrictions noted in a model’s entry
within their gang list. Also, the limit of no more than
three weapons for fighters must be adhered to, with
weapons marked with a \* taking the space of two.

Once any equipment has been added to a Fighter card
or Vehicle card, the card’s Credits cost is updated
accordingly. If the model is equipped with an item
that has two different costs – one in the model’s
own Equipment List and the other in the Trading
Post – the value in the model’s own Equipment List
takes precedence.

Players are reminded that no fighter can discard a
weapon or Wargear that grants the [Mounted condition](/docs/general-principles/conditions#mounted)
once added to their Fighter cards. Remember as well that fighters with the Tools
of the Trade special rule can have multiple Fighter
cards, each representing a different set of equipment,
as described on [Equipment Sets](/docs/founding-a-gang/gang-creation#equipment-sets).

### E. Purchase Advancements

In Campaign play, each player can use this step of
the post-battle sequence to spend Experience (XP), allowing their fighters to purchase [Advancements](/docs/the-rules/gaining-experience#advancements).

### F. Update Gang Rating

Re-calculate the gang’s Gang Rating, and update the
roster accordingly. Note that this is not done until this
step of the post-battle sequence, meaning that any
other references to the Gang Rating in the post-battle
sequence are referring to the Gang Rating prior to
this step.

## 7. Report Results

Finally, the players should report the outcome of the
battle to the Arbitrator of their campaign, who will
update the campaign stats accordingly. The report
should contain: which gangs fought, the outcome of
the battle (i.e., who won), which Territory the victor
gained control of, how many enemies each gang took
Out of Action and the final Gang Rating and Wealth of
the gangs.
