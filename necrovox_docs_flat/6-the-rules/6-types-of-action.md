# Types Of Action

_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

The following section covers the types of actions models can perform when activated. The actions available to a
model differ depending on whether it is a fighter or a vehicle.

Players should take note that whilst the actions a
model can perform are based upon their current Status
and Secondary Status, performing an action can and
will, in many cases, change either their Status, their
Secondary Status, or both.

There are four types of action a model may perform
when activated:

## Simple Action

A model can perform the same Simple action more
than once during its activation. Each time a Simple
action is repeated during an activation, it uses up one
action. For example, a Standing and Active fighter may
perform two Move (Simple) actions, using both of their
actions but allowing them to move twice. If an active
model’s first action is a Simple action, it may fully
resolve it before declaring its second action.

## Changing Facing

Fighters can change their facing during their
activation, representing them turning in place, or turning their head from side to side. When a
Standing fighter is activated, they may turn to face
any direction their controlling player wishes, before
making either of their actions. Changing facing in
this way does not count as moving, and therefore
can be combined with any other action.

Players should note, however, that a fighter that
changes their facing when Standing and Engaged
will normally suffer negative modifiers to any Hit
rolls they make. This represents the fighter turning
quickly to confront an attacker.

Prone fighters, as has been mentioned previously, have no facing. When they stand up, the controlling
player can choose in which direction they face.

## Basic Actions

A Basic action can only be performed once per model
activation. If an activated model’s first action is a
Basic action, it may fully resolve it before declaring
its second action.

## Double Actions

Performing a Double action counts as making two
actions. For example, if a Mobile vehicle makes a Ram(Double) action, it will have used both of its actions
and cannot perform another during this activation. If a
model can only perform one action during its activation
for any reason, it may not perform a Double action.

## Free Actions

Performing a Free action does not count as using
one of your actions. Each Free action can only be
performed once per activation. A model may not
perform a Free action with the same name as a
Basic action that they have performed this activation
and vice versa.

## Changing Action Type

Some effects may change an action’s type; for example, the Unwieldy trait changes the Shoot (Basic) action
to a Shoot (Double) action. Unless stated otherwise, any effect that applies to an action applies regardless
of the action type (i.e., if a gang tactic is triggered by a
Shoot (Basic) action it will also be triggered by a Shoot
(Double) or a Shoot (Simple) action).
