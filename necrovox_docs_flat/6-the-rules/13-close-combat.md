# Close Combat

_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

Fighters that are Standing and Engaged with an enemy model may make close combat attacks against that
model. Most often, this is done by performing a Fight (Basic) action – either on its own when the fighter is
activated or for free as part of a Charge (Double) action – or by making Reaction attacks after an enemy fighter
they are engaged with has resolved a Fight (Basic) action against them. Additionally, certain skills, gang tactics
and the Mounted condition will also allow fighters to make a close combat attack outside of the normal sequence
of the battle.

Whenever a fighter makes a close combat attack
against one or more enemy models using a weapon
with the Melee or Sidearm trait(s), this sequence
is followed:

1. Turn to Face
2. Choose Weapons
3. Determine Attack Dice
4. Declare Targets
5. Make Hit Roll(s)
6. Resolve Hits
7. Reaction Attacks
8. Consolidate or Coup De Grace

### Charging Prone Or Out Of Line Of Sight Fighters

When a Prone and Pinned fighter is successfully
charged they will automatically change their
status to Standing and Engaged, however for the
purposes of Reaction attacks they count as having
turned to face the enemy.

If a fighter charges an enemy fighter they could
not draw line of sight to then they must apply a -1
modifier to their hits when making their free Fight
(Basic) action.

:::

## 1. Turn To Face

The attacking fighter may turn to face any direction. Sometimes this will be essential, especially if they wish
to attack an enemy that is Engaging them but that is
not within their vision arc. However, doing so causes
a -1 modifier to apply to the fighter’s Hit rolls. This
modifier is cumulative with any others. For example,
if a fighter that is Broken turns to face before making
a Reaction attack, they will suffer a -3 modifier to their
Hit rolls.

## 2. Choose Weapons

The controlling player declares which weapons the
fighter will use. A fighter can use up to two weapons
with either the Melee or the Sidearm trait, but only one
if it also has the Unwieldy trait. Alternatively, the fighter
may make unarmed attacks.

**Unarmed Attacks:** A fighter that is not armed with
any weapons with either the Melee or Sidearm traits
may still make close combat attacks, either as part
of an action or as a reaction to an attack from an
enemy fighter.

An unarmed attack uses the fighter’s unmodified
Strength characteristic, has no AP and has a Damage
of 1.

## 3. Determine Attack Dice

The number of Attack dice rolled is equal to
the fighter’s Attacks characteristic, plus the
following modifiers:

- Dual Weapons with the Melee or Sidearm trait (+1)
- Charging (+1)

If the fighter is attacking with more than one weapon, the Attack dice must be split as evenly as possible
between the two weapons, ideally allocating an equal
number of Attack dice to each weapon. Where this
is not possible, for instance if the fighter has an odd
number of Attacks to make, the controlling player
may choose which weapon is allocated the extra
Attack dice.

**Pistols at Close Quarters:** A weapon with the Sidearm
trait can only have one Attack dice allocated to it. Any
remaining Attack dice must be allocated to a weapon
with the Melee trait. If a fighter has no other weapons
with the Melee trait, any remaining Attack dice must be
allocated to Unarmed attacks, as described previously.

If a fighter attacks with a weapon with the Sidearm trait
in close combat, Accuracy modifiers do not apply – this
is only used when making ranged attacks.

### Fighting Across Barricades

A fighter that is in base contact with an obstacle

that is less than 1" wide counts as being engaged
with an enemy fighter if that enemy fighter is in
base contact with the other side of the obstacle, even though the fighters themselves are not
in base to base contact. Fighters armed with
weapons with the Versatile trait can fight across
wider obstacles if the enemy fighter is within the
range of the weapon.

:::

## 4. Declare Targets

When a fighter makes a close combat attack, it must
be against an eligible target. An eligible target is
an enemy model that is within the vision arc of the
fighter, and that the fighter is [Engaging](/docs/general-principles/status#secondary-statuses-while-standing). If there is more than one eligible target,
close combat attacks can be split between them as the
player wishes.

## 5. Make Hit Roll(s)

Each Attack dice is used to make a Hit roll. A Hit roll is a
Weapon Skill test made against the WS of the attacking
fighter. Roll separately for each different weapon being
used by the fighter and/or for different targets.

Hit rolls may be modified by +1 for each assist froma
friendly fighter also engaged with the target, or by -1
for each enemy fighter also [Engaging](/docs/general-principles/status#secondary-statuses-while-standing) the attacker.

Note that BS is not used to make Hit rolls in close
combat, even when a ranged weapon with the Sidearm trait is used. When making a Hit roll for a weapon
with the Sidearm trait, a WS test is made, exactly as
described above.

**Rolls of a Natural 1:** If, when making a close
combat attack, the Hit roll is a natural 1, the attack
automatically misses, regardless of any modifiers that
may apply.

## 6. Resolve Hits

Each attack that scores a hit is resolved as described in [Resolving Hits](/docs/the-rules/resolve-hits).

## 7. Reaction Attacks

If there are still enemies that are Standing and
Engaged with the attacker, they may make Reaction
attacks, following steps 1-6.

### Attacking Vehicles

A fighter that is within 1" of a vehicle may make
close combat attacks against it as if they were
engaged with that vehicle, though in all other
respects they count as Standing and Active. When
a fighter makes a close combat attack against a
vehicle, they may apply a +1 modifier to the Hit
roll. A fighter Engaging a vehicle in close combat
may roll an additional Location dice, choosing one
result to apply and discarding the other(s).

A vehicle never counts as being engaged and may
freely move out of engagement range of enemy
fighters, however when it does those fighters may
make an Initiative test, and can make Reaction
attacks against the vehicle if they pass.

A fighter attacking a vehicle cannot gain the
benefits of assists. Additionally, vehicles cannot
make Reaction attacks and can never grant
assists to friendly fighters.

Any hits scored in close combat are resolved
against the Toughness value of the facing they
are in contact with. If a fighter is on the vehicle, resolve them against the lowest Toughness. If a
fighter wrecks a vehicle, they may consolidate as
described previously.

:::

## 8. Consolidate Or Coup De Grace

If all enemy models the attacker was engaged with are
now either Prone and Seriously Injured or Wrecked, the
fighter may make a free Coup De Grace (Simple) action
against one such enemy fighter.

Alternatively, if all enemy models the attacker was
engaged with are now Prone and Seriously Injured, have gone Out of Action or are Wrecked, the fighter
may move up to 2" in any direction.

#### Assists & Interference

Engaging more than one opponent is much more
difficult than Engaging a lone fighter. When making
close combat attacks, a fighter can claim ‘assists’ fromfriendly fighters who are also engaged with the target
of the attack, and can suffer ‘interference’ from enemy
fighters other than the target of the attack who are
also engaged with them.

#### Assists

When a fighter makes a close combat attack, they can
claim an assist from each other friendly fighter that is:

- Engaged with the target of the attack.
- Not engaged with any other fighters from the same
  gang as the target of the attack.

Each assist claimed in this way adds a +1 modifier to
the Hit roll.

#### Interference

When a fighter makes a close combat attack, they
may suffer interference from each other enemy fighter
that is:

- Engaged with the attacker.
- Not engaged with any other fighters from the same
  gang as the attacker.

Each interference causes a -1 modifier to apply to the
Hit roll.
