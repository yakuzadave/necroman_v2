These rules vary across publications, with some contradictions. The community has created compilations to keep the game playable. The goal of this website is to make the rules clear and accessible, consolidating all content from the 2017 release onwards. Initially based on the Necrodamus rules compilation, the 2023 Core Rules are now used verbatim (RAW), covering both these and previous publications.\n\n**Note:** All original content is owned by Games Workshop and published here without permission. Supporting the game by purchasing gangs and their corresponding House/Books is encouraged, as Necromunda is narrative-rich with extensive backstories."
