Imperial records are vague on the origins of these hardy creatures, only stating that perhaps somewhere in humanity\u2019s dim and distant past they share a common ancestor with the humans of today. What is known, at least on Necromunda, is that the Squats came to that world some ten thousand years ago, not long after its conquest by the Imperium, when the scars of a galaxy- spanning civil war were still fresh on the face of the world, and much rebuilding needed to be done. For this task the Squats were unequalled in their skill, being a race of engineers, architects and craftsmen. Dozens of great Squat clans came to Necromunda in this time, and it is in no small part due to their efforts that the world prospered as it did, many within the hives oblivious to the debt they owe to the Squats.\nCenturies later, the Squats, or Ironhead Squats as they are known to the people of the wastes, live a seminomadic lifestyle in their great land trains, travelling from mining site to mining site syphoning off the wealth of 10,000 years of pollution to sell to the Clan Houses. These vast mechanical mining rigs are like cities on tracks, and the sound of their rumbling passage carries for kilometres in all directions as they crawl from one mine to the next. When a land train reaches a suitable dig site it forms a laager, or circle of great vehicles, and might stay for months or even years as it plunders the earth beneath its tracks. While the laager is in place, prospecting parties range out in all directions from it, seeking fresh finds and protecting their clan \u2013 until the time the laager is broken down, and the land train moves on to fresh prospecting grounds.\nFIGHTERS\n\n115CREDITS\nCHARTER MASTER (LEADER)\n\n\n\nSkills:\n\u00a01 Primary (custom).\nRestrictions:\n\u00a0None.\n85CREDITS\nDRILL MASTER (CHAMPION)\n\n\n\nSkills:\n\u00a01 Primary (custom).\nRestrictions:\n\u00a0None.\n50CREDITS\nDRILL-KYN (GANGER)\n\n\n\nRestrictions:\n\u00a0Pistol, Basic, Close Combat.\n35CREDITS\nDIGGER (JUVE)\n\n\n\nRestrictions:\n\u00a0Pistol, Basic, Close Combat.\n250CREDITS\n0-2 VARTIJAN EXO-DRILLER (BRUTE)\n\n\n\nSkills:\n\u00a0Nobody Pushes Kin Around.\nWargear:\n\u00a0\nLight carapace (4+)\n.\nWeapons:\n\u00a0Heavy flamer (Vartijan), power claw, seismic crusher.\nOPTIONS\n\nVartijan Heavy bolter (replaces heavy flamer):\n\u00a0+50\nGUARD EXOSUIT\n\nCan always be included as Sentry (regardless of Crew Selection), this is in addition to the normal crew size.\nSENSOR SUITE\n\nTreats Visibility (X) as 3\" higher.\n40CREDITS\nGEARHEAD (CREW)\n\n\n\n265CREDITS\nSKALVIAN EXPLORATOR (VEHICLE)",

To the people of Necromunda they are as alien and unsettling as any known xenos species.

The difference between the two, however, is as stark as the difference between civilisation and barbarism.\nFIGHTERS\n\n120CREDITS\nKHA'TRAGI CHIEFTAIN (LEADER)\n\n\n\nSkills:\n\u00a01 Primary (custom).\nWargear:\n\u00a0Ash cloak, sky mantle.\u00a0\nRestrictions:\n\u00a0None.\n120CREDITS\nWY'TARI STORMCALLER (SPECIALIST CHAMPION)\n\n\n\nSkills:\n\u00a01 Primary (custom).\nWargear:\n\u00a0Ash cloak.\nRestrictions:\n\u00a0None.\nBORN IN THE SADDLE (DUSTBACK HELAMITE)\n\nAlways Mounted:\nM 8\".\nMighty Leap\n.\nCALL THE STORM\n\nIf equipped with a Stormcaller staff, spend a Double action (Change Weather) to modify Visibility (X\") (depending on whether any Visibility is active or not) for the rest of the battle (note that Visibility can be modified further by future use of this ability):\nInactive: Apply Visibility (24\").\nActive: Modify Visibility by +/- 6\" (min 6\").\n110CREDITS\nNAKU'TAARI WATCHER (CHAMPION)\n\n\n\nSkills:\n\u00a01 Primary (custom).\nWargear:\n\u00a0Ash cloak, sky mantle.\u00a0\nRestrictions:\n\u00a0None.\n65CREDITS\nTARN'RUNI WARRIOR (GANGER)\n\n\n\nWargear:\n\u00a0Ash cloak, sky mantle.\u00a0\nRestrictions:\n\u00a0Pistol, Basic, Special, Close Combat.\n80CREDITS\nTARH'NOKI DUST RIDER (JUVE SPECIALIST)\n\n\n\nWargear:\n\u00a0Ash cloak.\nRestrictions:\n\u00a0Pistol, Special, Close Combat.\nBORN IN THE SADDLE (DUSTBACK HELAMITE)\n\nAlways Mounted:\nM 8\".\nMighty Leap\n.\n35CREDITS\nRUN'TAANI DUST RUNNER (JUVE)\n\n\n\nWargear:\n\u00a0Ash cloak, sky mantle.\u00a0\nRestrictions:\n\u00a0Pistol, Basic, Special, Close Combat.\n210CREDITS\n0-2 ARTHROMITE DUNESKUTTLER (BRUTE)\n\n\n\n\n\nSkills:\n\u00a0\nFearsome\n,\u00a0\nNerves of Steel\n.\nWeapons:\n\u00a0Mandibles.\nWargear:\n\u00a0Heavy carapace.\nSpecial Rules:\n\u00a0Wall Scuttler, Hard to Kill.\nSpecial Rules\nLore\nSource: Book of the Outlands\nSKILL ACCESS",

Whether or not these are actual supernatural creatures who aid the outland fighters in battle, or perhaps merely an aspect of their strange religion manifested through latent psychic abilities, is unknown, though their effectiveness in battle cannot be denied.\nSUMMONING THE SPIRITS\n\nThere are six different Warrior Spirits that an Ash Waste Nomads gang can benefit from in an Ash Wastes battle. In Step 7 of the pre-battle sequence, the Ash Waste Nomads player rolls a number of D6 equal to the number of Watchers and Chieftains they have in their crew. Compare the result of each dice to the Warrior Spirit table below to see which Warrior Spirits the gang has available for this battle. Note that multiples of the same spirit may be generated for each battle if duplicate results are rolled on any of the dice.\nUSING WARRIOR SPIRITS IN BATTLE\n\nAt the start of an Ash Waste Nomads Chieftain\u2019s or Watcher\u2019s activation, before they perform any actions, they may choose to benefit from a Warrior Spirit (note that multiple Warrior Spirits cannot be invoked in the same activation). Choose one of the spirits generated for the battle and immediately apply its effects to the active fighter.

From birth, a hiver will know their place in the great machine that is the hive world, doing their part to ensure a never-ending supply of munitions and other goods rolls out of its factoria. It is rare for a hiver to reject their station, and rarer still for them to cast off the hierarchy of House and hive altogether. Even the so-called criminals of Necromunda are part of the system, as are the Clan House gangs who wreak sanctioned violence in the underhive. Helots, cults and even heretics are also part of the system, the former vital property of the Houses, the latter clearly defined enemies of the Imperium and therefore an expected evil. There are, of course, those who do not fit into these structures, either as loyal servants of the Houses, members of the Merchant Guild or criminal fraternity, or even as part of the organised cultist underground. Collectively, these hivers are known as outcasts, and it is from their ranks that the majority of hive scum hail.\nGANG COMPOSITION\n\nAll Underhive Outcasts gangs must always follow these rules:\nThere must be one fighter with the Leader special rule.\nWhen creating the gang, there can be no more than two fighters with the Gang Hierarchy (Champion) special rule in the gang.\nDuring Campaign play, there can be one fighter with the Gang Hierarchy (Champion) special rule for every three fighters with the Gang Fighter (X) special rule.\nThe total number of fighters with the Gang Fighter (X) special rule in the gang must always be equal to, or higher than, the total number of fighters without the Gang Fighter (X) special rule combined, not counting Hangers-on or Hired Guns.\nThe Underhive Outcasts gang does not contain any Juves; whenever a rule refers to a Juve it instead affects an Underhive Outcasts Hive Scum.\nShould it occur during the course of a campaign that the number of fighters without the Gang Fighter (X) special rule exceeds the total number of fighters with the Gang Fighter (X) special rule, the controlling player must either:\nRecruit fresh fighters with the Gang Fighter (X) special rule in order to correct the imbalance.\nOr:\nRetire a number of fighters without the Gang Fighter (X) special rule special rule during the post-battle sequence in order to correct the imbalance.\nDELEGATION GANGS\n\nWhen an individual decides, or is forced, to become an outcast they do not always go alone.

When selecting a leader in this way the player must choose one of the multiple profiles presented to represent their leader, and choose an\u00a0\nAffiliation\n\u00a0and\u00a0\nArchetype\n. These choices allow the player to create an Underhive Outcast Leader suited to a particular miniature or background of their choosing. Once these choices have been made, they cannot be altered.\nELEVATING AN UNDERHIVE OUTCASTS LEADER\n\nAlternatively, the player can choose an existing fighter profile and elevate them to Underhive Outcasts Leader status. This fighter can come from any Necromunda publication and includes, but is not limited to: Clan House gang leaders, Guild, Noble and Criminal fighters, Dramatis Personae and Hangers-on. Once a profile has been selected, the player then follows the steps on listed here to elevate them to Leader status. Once a fighter has been elevated, they are then considered to be the Leader of the gang.\nDESIGNER\u2019S NOTE: ELEVATING A FIGHTER TO LEADER STATUS\nThere are many kinds of Underhive Outcasts Leaders that can be created using the profiles, Archetypes and Affiliations presented in this section. It might be, however, that you want to create an Underhive Outcasts gang centred around an existing fighter from another gang list or Necromunda publication. This is entirely appropriate, as Bounty Hunters, Hangers-on and even Dramatis Personae might all rise up to lead a gang at some point or another in their careers.\nThe first step is to choose a fighter to become your Underhive Outcasts Leader. This can be literally any fighter with a profile, whether they could normally be part of a gang or not. Dramatis Personae, Hangers-on and Hired Guns are particularly suited to becoming gang leaders and should prove easy to convert. Other kinds of fighters might need more work, and some should probably only be allowed with the agreement of the campaign Arbitrator (as fun as it would be to have a gang of Underhive Outcasts led by a sentient Scrapcode Ambot!).\nThe fighter retains any skills, equipment or special rules they might have. Alternatively, you can replace their skills and equipment with those available to an Underhive Outcasts Leader. Whichever option is taken, you need to choose an appropriate Affiliation and Archetype for the fighter.\nThe fighter retains their cost in credits, and throughout a campaign gains Experience and can be equipped with Wargear like a normal fighter.\nThe fighter gains all the special rules an Underhive Outcasts Leader has.\nNote that due to the incredibly wide variety of fighters available to be elevated to an Underhive Outcasts Leader, this method may lead to some unbalanced gangs. The campaign Arbitrator always has the final say on whether these rules can be used and how they are applied.\nDEATH OF AN UNDERHIVE OUTCASTS LEADER\n\nAll Underhive Outcasts gangs must include a single fighter with the \u2018Gang Leader\u2019 special rule. This fighter is, naturally, the leader of the gang.\nIf an Underhive Outcasts gang\u2019s leader is killed, the gang falls apart. When this happens, a new Underhive Outcasts gang will often form to fill the power vacuum.\nTo represent this, follow these steps:\nCreate a new gang following all the normal rules for founding an Underhive Outcasts Gang, with the exception that the starting credits for the new gang is equal to 75% of the previous gang\u2019s Wealth after fully resolving the post-battle sequence or 1,000 credits, whichever is higher.\nFighters from the previous gang can be added to this new gang; just pay their credit cost and add them to the roster.\nIf at least half of the fighters from the previous gang are included in the new gang, it starts with D6 less Reputation (to a minimum of 1) but still has any territory or settlement structures previously held.",

Otherwise, the new gang starts from scratch with nothing in the previous gang\u2019s Stash carried over.\nAFFILIATION\n\nNo one on Necromunda can escape the crushing social structure of the hives. Subjects of the Imperial House are born into servitude or obligation and live out their lives seldom rising or falling far beyond their station. Even so-called outcasts, who reject the notions of House and hive, cannot escape the circumstances of their heritage; they carry it with them into the badzones and beyond when they try to shake off the rule of Lord Helmawr.\nTo represent the huge variety of potential Underhive Outcasts Leaders, when an Underhive Outcasts gang is created its Leader must choose an Affiliation. An Affiliation is a glimpse into the origins of the Leader, or speaks to the contacts they still maintain with those more mainstream members of society. There are five different Affiliations an Underhive Outcasts Leader can choose from: Clanless, Clan House, Merchant Guild, Criminal Organisation or Noble House. Each comes with its own advantages and disadvantages, but most importantly will determine the equipment the Underhive Outcasts Leader and their gang have access to, as well as the kinds of Alliances they might be able to make. Once the choice of Affiliation has been made, it cannot be changed \u2013 not even an outcast can escape their past.\nCLANLESS\n\nThis is the most common Affiliation for an outcast leader. It represents a leader without any strong ties to any of the great organisations of Necromunda, or a true outlander who was raised beyond the social structures of the hive. Clanless leaders are universally looked down upon by the rest of Necromunda and must work all the harder to prove themselves. Being clanless does come with some benefits, as those who have never been beholden to the rules of the Imperial House find breaking them all the easier.\nA Clanless Underhive Outcasts Leader and their gang gains the following Benefits and Drawbacks:\nClanless Underhive Outcasts gangs do not suffer any ill effects from being either Law Abiding or Outlaw. In effect, these states have no meaning for them, and they can freely choose options available to either, such as hiring Outlaw or Law Abiding Hired Guns, while rival gangs gain no extra credits for selling them to Guilders.\nClanless Underhive Outcasts gangs gain no additional options for purchasing weapons or Wargear.\nClanless Underhive Outcasts gangs are universally distrusted, and as such can never form Alliances.\nCLAN HOUSE\n\nMany outcast leaders were once members of a Clan House, but have since fallen out of favour with their old masters. Being a former member of a clan comes with many benefits, such as access to restricted House tech or specialised training. It also makes certain alliances easier, as even a fallen member of a clan is still considered trustworthy by many who hold the clan in high esteem. Of course, with clan affiliation comes drawbacks, the most notable of which is all the clan\u2019s enemies remain your enemies.\nA Clan House Underhive Outcasts Leader and their gang gains the following Benefits and Drawbacks:\nWhen a Clan House Underhive Outcasts gang is created, you must choose one of the six Clan Houses for them to affiliate with: Cawdor, Delaque, Escher, Goliath, Van Saar or Orlock. For any scenario or campaign purposes, the Underhive Outcasts gang is considered to be a Clan House gang of the chosen type.\nClan House Underhive Outcasts gangs may purchase weapons and Wargear normally restricted to their House Lists \u2013 including Exotic Beasts \u2013 during both gang creation and Campaign play.\nClan House Underhive Outcasts gangs can only enter into Alliances with factions their Clan House would normally form a Strong Alliance with.

Note, they do not benefit from having a Strong Alliance with them.\nMERCHANT GUILD\n\nIt is rare for members of the Merchant Guild to go rogue and become underhive outcasts, though it does still happen more often than the Imperial House would like to admit. A former member of one of the infamous Mercators of Necromunda can make for a formidable gang leader, and they often have a host of specialised equipment and weaponry at their disposal. Furthermore, the ties that bind the Merchant Guild are strong, and even an outcast Guilder can call upon considerable aid should they ask for it.\nA Merchant Guild Underhive Outcasts Leader and their gang gains the following Benefits and Drawbacks:\nWhen creating a Merchant Guild Underhive Outcasts gang, you must choose one of the following Guilds to affiliate with: Guild of Coin, Iron Guild, Corpse Guild, Water Guild, Promethium Guild or Slave Guild. For any scenario or campaign purposes, the Underhive Outcasts gang is considered to be a Guild of the chosen type.\nMerchant Guild Underhive Outcasts gangs may purchase any weapons and Wargear that members of their chosen Guild Delegation are equipped with from the Trading Post during gang creation and Campaign play regardless of Rarity or Legality.\nMerchant Guild Underhive Outcasts gangs can buy Cult Icons for 40 credits.\nMerchant Guild Underhive Outcasts gangs can only enter into an Alliance with their chosen Guild.\nCRIMINAL ORGANISATION\n\nCriminals are a natural fit for underhive outcasts gangs, their nefarious tendencies lending themselves to rejecting the constraints of Necromundan society. Hive scum will flock to the banner of a powerful criminal underhive outcast leader, the lure of easy creds a potent one, while the criminal\u2019s connections mean they can expect greater access to illegal firepower. As with the Guilds, some criminal organisations on Necromunda stick together, and a criminal underhive outcast leader can expect help from their former partners in crime.\nA Criminal Underhive Outcasts Leader and their gang gains the following Benefits and Drawbacks:\nWhen creating a Criminal Underhive Outcasts gang, you must choose one Criminal Organisation to affiliate with: Cold Traders, Imperial Imposters, Rogue Factoria, Narco Lords, Fallen Houses or Psi- Syndica. For any scenario or campaign purposes, the Underhive Outcasts gang is considered to be a Criminal Organisation of the chosen type.\nCriminal Underhive Outcasts gangs may purchase any weapons and Wargear that members from their chosen Criminal Organisation Delegation are equipped with from the Trading Post during gang creation and Campaign play, regardless of Rarity or Legality.\nCriminal Underhive Outcasts gangs can only enter into an Alliance with their chosen Criminal Organisation.\nNOBLE HOUSE\n\nWhen a noble rejects a pampered life in the spire, there is usually a very good reason behind it. As rare as outcast Guilders are, noble outcasts are even rarer, though almost without exception they are talented and determined men and women who share a universal hatred of their own kind. Outcast nobles often take their resources with them when they fall and their gangs are well-funded and equipped. Other organisations on Necromunda are rightly wary of their motivations, however, and their alliances can be erratic at best.\nA Noble House Underhive Outcasts Leader and their gang gains the following Benefits and Drawbacks:\nWhen creating a Noble House Underhive Outcasts gang you must choose one Noble House to affiliate with: Catallus, Ty, Ulanti, Greim, Ran Lo or Ko\u2019Iron. For any scenario or campaign purposes, the Underhive Outcasts gang is considered to be a Noble House of the chosen type.\nNoble House Underhive Outcasts gangs may purchase weapons and Wargear that members from their chosen Noble House Delegation are equipped with from the Trading Post during gang creation and Campaign play, regardless of Rarity or Legality.",

Some are brutal overlords who rule through physical strength and crush all in their path; others are more cunning, manipulating those around them to do their bidding; others still can call upon the powers of the Warp to keep their gang in line. Archetypes allow you to further customise your Underhive Outcasts Leader by giving them access to different skill sets. In addition to influencing the kind of Leader the Underhive Outcast is, an Archetype will also influence the Leader\u2019s gang, passing on their favoured tactics to those who follow them.\nThere are five different kinds of Archetypes: Brawler, Gunslinger, Survivor, Mastermind and Wyrd. When an Underhive Outcasts Leader or Champion is recruited to an Underhive Outcasts gang they must choose one of these Archetypes, and it may not be changed later on.\nBRAWLER\n\nBrawlers are brutes who rule through physical violence and being bigger than anyone else around. While a brawler can still be smart \u2013 after all, it takes more than brawn alone to survive in the underhive \u2013 they like to settle their problems personally, usually with the sharp end of a melee weapon, or better yet their fists.\nGUNSLINGER\n\nIn the underhive, there are as many gunslingers as there are guns, but only the truly talented live long enough to make a name for themselves. Much like a brawler, a gunslinger is a leader by virtue of their combat prowess. Whereas the brawler uses their brawn, the gunslinger relies on more sophisticated means of dishing out violence.\nSURVIVOR\n\nA survivor is a leader who has, against the odds, risen to power. They might have once been a humble ganger or champion, perhaps they have even run with multiple underhive outcasts gangs in their time. The true talent of the survivor is not their skill with a blade or pistol, but knowing when it\u2019s time to cut their losses and head for the badzones.\nMASTERMIND\n\nThe mastermind is a cunning manipulator of men and women, and has risen to power through the careful use of alliances and patsies. A mastermind seldom does their own dirty work, preferring to hang back and let their minions sell their lives to advance their agendas; it is a measure of their talent that there always seems to be more scum willing to follow them.\nMUTANT\n\nMutants are misshapen outcasts who have fled a life of slavery or abuse to eke out an existence in the deepest parts of the underhive. Mutants who rise to lead gangs of Outcasts are often the toughest of their kind, \u2018blessed\u2019 with a variety of advantageous and terrifying mutations.\nIn addition, Mutants can also choose\u00a0\nOutcast Mutations\n\u00a0in place of skills. Furthermore, if the Leader of an Underhive Outcasts gang has the Mutant Archetype, then Outcast Mutations will also be available to Underhive Outcasts Hive Scum in their gang.\nMutant Affiliations\nMutants are trusted even less than most underhive scum, being somewhere below outlaws but slightly above Chaos worshippers in the eyes of the Clan and Noble Houses. For this reason, an Underhive Outcasts Leader that takes the Mutant Archetype can only have the Clanless Affiliation.\nWYRD\n\nMutants and psykers are reviled on Necromunda and often cast to the fringes of society. The wyrd leader is one such dispossessed individual, and their gang is often filled with similar kinds of outcasts. An underhive outcasts gang led by a wyrd can be a truly terrible thing, and whole levels of a hive have burned to root these dangerous individuals out.",

It is the great cycle of existence that rules over all who serve the Imperial House, the denizens of the hives either feeding on their predecessors, or feeding the living with their own dead flesh. Corpse Grinder Cults are a by-product of this brutal necessity, charged with the grim task of recycling their fellow hivers into corpse-starch. The Great Houses of Necromunda are intimately familiar with the Corpse Grinder Cults, for they are a plague that rises from within the mortuary combines and Corpse Guilds with regular frequency. Even in the unrelenting horror of the hive, those forced to recycle corpses sometimes rebel against reality, losing their sanity among the whirr of the meat-saw and wet crunch of the bone-grinders. Where once a creature of reason and temperance stood, now a hollow shell consumed by hunger remains \u2013 the perfect vessel for the corrupting touch of Chaos to infect.\nCorpse Grinder Cults often start within the hallowed ranks of the Corpse Guilds. From among the toiling workers a leader will arise. Whether these deranged individuals draw the gaze of the Blood God with their cannibal madness or if it is the influence of the Dark God who turns honest men to feast upon the cutting floor is unclear. The result, however, is the same. Over time, a cult leader will become stronger and more ravenous, the growling voice of Khorne driving them to murder so that they might feast upon warmand bloody flesh. Around these debased leaders, deviant cults are formed. Prospective followers might be drawn from within the mortuary manufactorums, or from the greater hive populace. At first trusted members are inducted, and offered a taste of the gory bounty smuggled out of production lines. Thus are entire families and hab communities corrupted, most knowing only that the meat gives them strength and endurance like nothing they have known, unaware of the dark blessing surrounding the cult leader.\nFIGHTERS\n\n130CREDITS\nBUTCHER (LEADER)\n\n\n\nSkills:\n\u00a01 Primary (custom).\nWargear:\n\u00a0Mask (Butcher), plate mail armour.\nRestrictions:\n\u00a0Close Combat.\nFIRST TO THE FRAY\n\nCharge distance is Move + D6\u201d (instead of D3\u201d).\nMASK (BUTCHER)\n\n6+ save (unmodifiable by AP).\nTerrifying.\nCan't be improved by other armour.\nTERRIFYING\n\nPass a Willpower test to target this fighter with a Fight (Basic) or Shoot (Basic) action, or the action ends immediately (wasted).

Weapons marked with an asterisk (*) take up the space of two weapons.\nAny fighter may take Wargear.\nWeapon accessories marked with a dagger (\u2020) may not be combined together on the same weapon. If one such accessory is purchased for a weapon, another may not be added.\nDuring an Uprising Campaign, gangs continue to follow the above rules as new fighters are added to the gang. Additionally, the following rules apply:\nDuring the course of an Uprising Campaign, any fresh recruits added to the gang may be equipped with items currently held in the gang\u2019s Stash, rather than purchasing new equipment.\nDuring the course of the campaign, gangs may gain new equipment, either by purchasing it from the gang\u2019s House Equipment List or as a result of Scavenging. These items are added to the gang\u2019s Stash and may be distributed among fighters during any post-battle sequence:\n\tA fighter cannot be given a new weapon of a type not allowed by their entry within their House List.\n\tLeaders and Champions can be given additional weapons, but if they have more than three weapons, they will have to fill out multiple Fighter cards, each representing a different \u2018set\u2019 of equipment.\n\tA fighter may discard any Wargear carried when given new Wargear. Discarded Wargear is placed in the gang\u2019s Stash.\nSPECIAL RULES\n\nIn a Dominion Campaign, Corpse Grinder Cult gangs are treated just like any other; they begin the campaign with a Settlement Territory which they cannot lose, representing their base of operations. They can take control of unoccupied Territories during the Occupation phase and they can seize control of Territories from other gangs during the Takeover phase.\nSettlement Territories do not generate Juves; instead, each D6 roll of a 6 generates a free Initiate. If both of the D6s roll a 6, this becomes a single Skinner.\nDespite their secret agenda, a Corpse Grinder Cult gang is seen as just another gang by most of the locals. They claim Territory Boons just like any other gang. Additionally, a Corpse Grinder Cult gang gains Enhanced Boons for a Corpse Farm Territory as if they were a Cawdor gang and from a Fighting Pit Territory as if they were a Goliath gang.\nOUTLAW\n\nA Corpse Grinder Cult gang is automatically an\u00a0\nOutlaw gang\n.\nAGENTS OF MISRULE\n\nIn a Law and Misrule Campaign, Corpse Grinder Cult gangs start aligned to Misrule. They cannot change their alignment over the course of the campaign.\nBLESSED BY THE LORD OF SKIN AND SINEW\n\nDESIGNER'S COMMENTARY\nPresented below are special rules that will allow you to recreate the events described in Sump City Sinking. If the Arbitrator wishes, these rules can be used by any Delaque gang during a campaign.\nWhen a Corpse Grinder Cult fighter with the Gang Hierarchy (X) special rule is activated, their controlling player may attempt to Invoke the Dark Gods before performing any actions.\nInvoke the Dark Gods:\n\u00a0This fighter makes a Willpower test, with a +3 modifier if they took an enemy fighter Out of Action in their previous activation. If the test is failed, roll an Injury dice apply the result immediately to this fighter. If the test is passed, the fighter gains the following benefits for the duration of this activation:\n+1 to their Strength, Toughness and Attacks characteristics.\nRoll a D6 at the end of their activation. On a result of a 4+, they can remove a single Flesh Wound or recover a single lost Wound.\nSource: Apocrypha Necromunda: Sump City Sinking\nLast updated\u00a0on",

        "71068c99-0d4f-4d72-bb48-1b07eb8ba011": "GENESTEALER CULT\nFew threats to the Imperium are as insidious as that posed by the Genestealer. A perfectly crafted organism, its sole purpose is to infiltrate and subvert the populations of entire worlds.\nGenestealer Cults are utterly loyal to their leaders in a way not even the word-keepers of House Cawdor could hope to impose. It is a link forged of genetics, a compulsion woven into each member\u2019s flesh, and thus utterly unbreakable. Without the direct influence of a brood lord, or the specialised mutations of the fourth generation, these splinter cults instead serve the strongest among their kind, often drawn from the first and second generation of their bloodline. These Cult Adept and Cult Alpha are far longer-lived than their heritage would suggest, as if their blood, mixed with that of the xenos, responds to the psychic needs of their family and so strengthens and elevates them. Under their sway hybrid Acolytes and Neophytes serve as foot soldiers, many passing for human, and even those who cannot are often mistaken for merely yet another of Necromunda\u2019s countless mutant inhabitants. Aberrants too can be found within the splinter cults, mistakes of biology, nonetheless given purpose in battle against the cult\u2019s enemies.\nAlmost all splinter cults are grown from mining families, and even generations on they use this guise to exist unnoticed among a world of humans. Clad in hazard suits and armed with a variety of scavenged weapons, mostly mining tools, splinter cults can form formidable gangs, as even the most primitive of blades can prove deadly when wielded by the hand of those who believe so completely in their cause. Tragically though, at least for the cult, their lifecycle remains stunted. Perhaps because of their separation from their distant brood father, Purestrains remain denied to them. In all likelihood, however, true glory still slumbers within the flesh of the family\u2019s members and should the brood father ever call them to his side, they will continue their march towards the next stage of their deadly evolution.\nThere is no way to tell how many of these splinter cults exist on Necromunda, cut off from the broodthing of Secundus, growing ever larger without any real goal save expanding their territories and extending their bloodline. A few though have made their mark, their names growing in the dark and cursed by their enemies, though still far beneath the notice of the Imperial House and its vast armies.\nFIGHTERS\n\n120CREDITS\nCULT ADEPT (LEADER)\n\n\n\nSkills:\n\u00a01 Primary, 1 Wyrd Power (either form the\u00a0\nlist below\n\u00a0or the\u00a0\nuniversal lists\n).\nRestrictions:\n\u00a0None.\nUNSANCTIONED PSYKER\n\nGain additional Wyrd Powers as Primary skills.\n145CREDITS\nCULT ALPHA (LEADER)\n\n\n\nSkills:\n\u00a01 Primary.\nWargear:\n\u00a0Hazard Suit.\nRestrictions:\n\u00a0None.\nTHIRD ARM\n\nAny fighter with a third arm may use it to better handle Unwieldy weapons, or to gain an extra attack in combat.

If one such accessory is purchased for a weapon, another may not be added.\nDuring a campaign, all gangs continue to follow the above rules as new fighters are added to the gang. Additionally, the following rules apply:\nA gang founded for a campaign can contain no more than two Hybrid Acolytes. Additional Hybrid Acolytes may be added to the gang during the course of the campaign.\nDuring the course of a campaign, any fresh recruits added to the gang may be equipped with items currently held in the gang\u2019s Stash, rather than purchasing new equipment.\nDuring the course of the campaign, gangs may gain new equipment, either by purchasing it from the Trading Post or as a result of Territory Boons. These items are added to the gang\u2019s Stash and may be distributed among fighters during any post-battle sequence:\nA fighter cannot be given a new weapon of a type not allowed by their entry within this gang list. Aberrants and Neophyte Hybrids cannot be given a new weapon if it would take them above the limit of three weapons carried.\nA Leader or Hybrid Acolyte can be given more than three weapons as they can have multiple Fighter cards, each representing a different \u2018set\u2019 of equipment, as described on page 95 of the Necromunda Rulebook.\nA fighter may discard any Wargear carried when given new Wargear.

Being the most overt and visible sign of Lord Helmawr's total dominion over Necromunda, the Palanite Enforcers are rightfully feared wherever they go.\nHowever, like much on Necromunda, appearances can be deceptive. Out in the badzones of the underhive, regular communication and consistent supply lares are impossible. However, the hive world's inhabitants cannot be allowed to believe they are beyond Helmawr's gaze. This leads to Precinct-Fortresses being set up far from the warmth of the hive's central heat sink. Initially well-supplied and with a full complement of Enforcers, these lone beacons of order are them left to their own devices to maintain the Pax Helmawr as best they can.\nIsolated as they are, Badzone Precinct Captains must abandon many of the restrictions their fellow Enforcers operate under if they are to survive, often abolishing the delineation of their forces between Palanites and Subjugators and even deputising hive scum to bulk out their numbers. Occasionally, an especially promising scum even gets accepted within the Badzone Enforcers' ranks; after all, losses must be replaced somehow. In addition, with limited resupplies of armaments making it through to them, Badzone Enforcers must rely upon whatever they can seize from other badzone elements or trade for on the open markets, with the more specialist equipment ending up in the hands of the Captains and Sergeants alone.\nThe following section, along with the Palanite Enforcers list, provide all the rules needed top run a Badzone Enforcers gang in your campaigns of Necromunda.\nGANG COMPOSITION\n\nEnforcers follow\u00a0\nnormal rules\n\u00a0with the following exceptions:\nMust have at least 1 Ganger per Leader / Champion.\nFIGHTERS\n\n125CREDITS\nCAPTAIN (LEADER)\n\n\n\nSkills:\n\u00a01 Primary (custom).\nWargear:\n\u00a0Magnacles, armoured undersuit.\nRestrictions:\n\u00a0None.\n85CREDITS\nSERGEANT (CHAMPION)\n\n\n\nSkills:\n\u00a01 Primary (custom).\nWargear:\n\u00a0Magnacles, armoured undersuit.\nRestrictions:\n\u00a0None.\n55CREDITS\nPATROLMAN (GANGER)\n\n\n\nWargear:\n\u00a0Magnacles, armoured undersuit.\nRestrictions:\n\u00a0None.\nBROKEN SUPPLY LINES\n\nGain Scarce for the following weapons:\nEnforcer Boltgun.\nCombat shotgun.\nConcussion carbine.\n30CREDITS\nENLISTED HIVE SCUM (JUVE)\n\n\n\nRestrictions:\n\u00a0Pistols, Basic and Close Combat.\nEXPENDABLE CONSCRIPT\n\nCannot benefit from or participate in\u00a0\nLeading By Example\n\u00a0or\u00a0\nGroup Activation\n.\nDoes not trigger Nerve tests to friendly fighters without this special rule within 3\u201d (when Seriously Injured or taken Out of Action).\nNOTE\nEnlisted Hive Scum are not exactly Juves.

When one must govern a populace of billions, all crammed into the close confines of ancient cities and eking out their lives on recycled food while they toil endlessly at their tasks, kind words and even-handed rules are not enough. Only a boot stamping down on the throat of the ungrateful and malcontent will do; the fear of sudden and brutal reprisal keeping millions of desperate souls in line. This monumental responsibility of maintaining order among the hellish confines of the hives falls to the Palanite Enforcers.\nMore akin to an army than a police force, the Enforcers trade in violence and control, purging settlements and habzones if even the faintest hint of sedition against Lord Helmwar\u2019s rule is uncovered. All manner of crime is met with a swift and vicious response, for those that transgress against the Imperial House must be brought to justice before they can corrupt others with their recidivist dogma. Such brutality is born not of a cruelty among the Palanite Enforcers or the sadistic will of Lord Helmawr himself, but rather as a simple necessity.

Their loyalty lies entirely with their masters and their dedication is unswerving.\nAs a matter of course, the canines that serve alongside the Palanite Enforcers of Necromunda are heavily-modified brutes, routinely fitted with armour to protect their vital organs and upgraded with bionics to enhance their performance. The nature of such enhancements varies, from advanced sensory arrays that can be tailored to the role of watchdog or hunting hound, to combat upgrades such as iron jaws and razor-edged fangs. It is these combat modifications that are seen most widely in the underhive and the gangs of Necromunda have rightly learned to fear the deployment of Hardcase Cyber-mastiffs on their turf.\n205CREDITS\n0-2 ENFORCER \u2018SANCTIONER\u2019 PATTERN AUTOMATA (BRUTE)",

A group of talented murderers can make a healthy living collecting the bounties of these criminals, killers and deviants.\nThe motley bands of hired guns who go after these bounties are commonly known as Venators, after the ancient High Gothic name for a hunting party; a temporary coalition of Bounty Hunters out for blood and coin. With the promise of shared rewards and extra firepower, Venators form into gangs and pursue Merchants Guild patronage and the stability that comes from regular contracts. Drawn from every Clan or House on Necromunda, Venators come in all shapes and sizes \u2013 mixing ex-Goliath heavies and nimble Escher assassins, alongside disgraced watchmen or embittered outcast nobles.

Sometimes this is whatever is lying around the underhive battlefield, such as barrels for cover or boltholes from which to launch ambushes. Other times they bring the terrain with them, setting up fixed weapon platforms, defensive barricades or piles of ammo crates within easy reach of their fighters.\nVan Saar gangs can call upon a number of specialist terrain features to include in their gang. These pieces of terrain are bought from the Trading Post during the post-battle sequence. Once bought, they are added to the gang\u2019s stash, and can be fielded in any battle the gang takes part in unless noted otherwise.\nPLACING GANG TERRAIN\n\nGang terrain is placed on the battlefield before any fighters are deployed. A gang can place its terrain in its own deployment area, or, if noted, in no-man\u2019s-land (i.e., anywhere outside their opponent\u2019s deployment zone and their own deployment zone). Some pieces of terrain (as noted in their descriptions) can only be used if the gang is the defender in a scenario with an attacker and a defender.\nVAN SAAR TERRAIN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHIDDEN TRAPS\n\nSome traps are cunningly hidden among the gloom and debris of the underhive, fighters not knowing if a pile of rubble is just more rubbish or a deadly surprise. If a trap uses the Hidden Traps rule then it is represented on the battlefield by not one but six markers. These markers can be tokens, or appropriate terrain elements on 25mm bases. When preparing these markers, one out of the six is the real trap (mark its underside, or secretly make a note to determine which one is real), the others are false traps. When a fighter triggers a trap, as detailed in the trap\u2019s description, it is revealed. False traps are discarded while the real trap remains on the battlefield. Note that even when the real trap is revealed, other false traps remain on the battlefield until they have been interacted with \u2013 this is important if more than one trap is in play, as it will keep the enemy guessing as to just how many traps remain to be discovered.\nRAD CANNON EMPLACEMENT\n\nThe signature weapons of House Van Saar are those which utilise the same deadly radiation that blights the very existence of the Van Saar themselves against their enemies. To the Van Saar, such weapons hold little terror \u2013 they are accustomed to wearing protective gear that shields them against this invisible poison, and spend their lives enduring the painful treatments required to purge their thin blood of radiation \u2013 but to outsiders, the debilitating after-effects of Rad weapons are fearful to behold.\nVan Saar gangs can only include a Rad Cannon Emplacement if they are the defender in a scenario with an attacker and defender. A Rad Cannon Emplacement uses the following profile:\n\n\nTHERMAL MINE\n\nA Thermal Mine is a larger, more powerful version of a melta bomb. When set off, the area within several metres of the mine is rapidly heated to temperatures high enough to melt rock. The effect on living organisms is profound, to say the least!\nThermal Mines are traps, and use the Hidden Traps rules. Thermal mines can be set up anywhere on the battlefield outside of your opponent\u2019s deployment area.\nWhen an enemy fighter moves within 2\" of a Thermal Mine marker, they must immediately stop and make an Initiative check. If this check is passed, they can continue their movement as normal. If it is failed, flip over the marker to see if it is the real trap as per the Hidden Traps rule. If it is a false trap, discard the marker. If it is the real trap, it explodes immediately with the following profile. Note that when a Thermal Mine explodes, every fighter that is currently within 6\" of the marker is hit, whilst those that are within 3\" of the marker are not only hit, but suffer the effects of the Melta trait.",
        "70e81a6d-2897-4bd8-89c6-1f2c87a1f8e8": "ENERGY SINK\n\nAn Energy Sink works by drawing power from its immediate environment to charge power cells. Prohibited across most of the Imperium due to how easily they can be misused to collect \u2018free\u2019 energy, House Van Saar seemingly cares little, utilising Energy Sinks to power their own weapons and disarm their enemies.\nAn Energy Sink can be represented by either a marker or a piece of terrain on a 25mm base. An Energy Sink can be set up anywhere on the battlefield outside of your opponent\u2019s deployment area.\nAny fighter, friend or foe, that attempts to make a ranged attack with a las or plasma weapon, or a weapon with the Melta trait, or that attempts to make a close combat attack with a weapon with the Power trait whilst too close to an Energy Sink will find its Strength reduced:\nIf the fighter is within 3\" of the Energy Sink, reduce the weapon\u2019s Strength by D3, to a minimum of 1.\nIf the fighter is within 6\" of the Energy Sink, reduce the weapon\u2019s Strength by 1.\nRAD CASTERS\n\nRad Casters hung from low ceilings or doorways slowly release deadly radiation into the air. They can be represented by either a marker or a piece of terrain on a 25mm base, and can be set up anywhere on the battlefield outside of your opponent\u2019s deployment area.\nIn the End phase, a fighter within 3\" of a Rad Casters must make a Toughness check, adding +1 to the roll for each item of Wargear and armour that protects against weapons with the Rad-phage trait. If this check is failed, or the roll was a natural 6, the fighter suffers an immediate Flesh Wound.\nRad Casters can be thrown by a friendly fighter in base contact with them, just as if they were a grenade. Work out this attack as normal, counting the Rad Casters as a rad grenade. Once the attack has been worked out, remove the marker from the battlefield.\nARCHAEO-RELIC\n\nHouse Van Saar relics are shrines to the wonders of technology. Strange structures that combine together advanced cogitation devices, weird power sources, and bizarre sensor arrays. Such devices are so alien in design to outsiders that they could easily be mistaken for being xenos in origin, and their disturbing appearance, combined with the strange waves of static and pulses of white noise, can deeply affect even the most unflappable of underhivers.\nAn Archaeo-relic counts as a Gang Relic (see the Necromunda Rulebook). In addition, enemy fighters who end their activation within 3\" of an Archaeo-relic must make an Intelligence check. If the check is passed, nothing happens. If, however, the check is failed, the fighter immediately becomes subject to the Insane condition (as described in the Necromunda Rulebook).\nVan Saar gangs can only include an Archaeo-relic if they are the defender in a scenario with an attacker and defender. An Archaeo-relic can be represented by an appropriate marker or a suitably impressive piece of industrial terrain, painted in the colours of the gang and modelled to represent advanced technology utilising unnatural and dangerous energy sources.\nNote that if the Archaeo-relic is defiled (see the Necromunda Rulebook), it loses the bonuses it provides to Cool and Leadership checks, but retains its other benefits.\nLast updated\u00a0on",
        "79508c49-8c40-4a5f-aed6-c49df5784344": "VAN SAAR ARCHAEO-CYBERTEKNIKA\nSource: House of Artifice\nHouse Van Saar has a well-deserved reputation for tech, and bionics in particular, their artisans providing augmetics for many of the Great Houses, as well the Merchant Guild, powerful criminals, and anyone else who can pay their high prices. This mastery of the cybernetic comes not solely from a desire to bring wealth to the Clan House, but out of a necessity to preserve the failing flesh of its people. By the time a Van Saar clanner comes of age, their body will already be starting to fail them, kept alive only by the systems of their survival suits. As they age, or are wounded in the endless wars of the underhive, their body will degrade further, and only the intervention of augmetics can keep them going. Fortunately for a Van Saar ganger, access to the clan\u2019s Cyberteknika (as it is known within the Clan House) is plentiful, and a successful fighter can greatly extend their own life span, enhance their abilities and hide their inward degeneration through the use of masterfully wrought artificial skin and limbs.\nUSING ARCHAEO-CYBERTEKNIKA\n\nAll Van Saar fighters have access to Cyberteknika, and as they gain advances or suffer injuries they can use Cyberteknika to repair and enhance themselves. There are a few ways for a fighter to gain a piece of Cyberteknika \u2013 either to repair a Lasting Injury, once they have spent Experience points for an advancement (representing the fighter\u2019s body aging) or during gang creation (reflecting the older, more experienced, members of the gang).\nTo repair a Lasting Injury, during any post-battle sequence, the player simply pays the credits cost for the Cyberteknika associated with the injury (Eyes, Hands, etc) and places the fighter Into Recovery. Once the fighter leaves Recovery, the effects of the Injury will have been replaced with the effects of the Cyberteknika.\nAlternatively, when a fighter gains a new advance, they may also replace any of their body parts with a piece of the Cyberteknika, paying the credits cost and going Into Recovery as above.\nFinally, Van Saar fighters with the Gang Hierarchy (X) special rule may be given Cyberteknika during gang creation at the cost listed as follows.\nUPGRADING ARCHAEO-CYBERTEKNIKA\n\nOnce a fighter has a piece of Cyberteknika, it is permanent. Cyberteknika can be used to replace any Bionics (as found in the Trading Post) in the location it is taken (Eyes, Hands, etc), and a fighter can only have one type of Cyberteknika in each location on their body. All Cyberteknika comes in three levels, ranked Alpha (the most basic), Gamma (intermediate), and Omega (the most advanced). When a fighter gains a piece of Cyberteknika, they can choose any level provided they can pay its cost in credits.\nFighters can also upgrade their Cyberteknika \u2013 this is the only instance in which they can change the type of Cyberteknika they have. To upgrade a piece of Cyberteknika the fighter must pay the difference between the cost of the level they have and the next level up, after which they will go into Recovery. Once the fighter leaves Recovery, they gain the improved piece of Cyberteknika (i.e., Alpha becomes Gamma and Gamma becomes Omega). Omega Cyberteknika cannot be upgraded.\nDAMAGED ARCHAEO-CYBERTEKNIKA\n\nIf a fighter with Cyberteknika suffers a Lasting Injury to a location with Cyberteknika, roll a D6. On a 4+ the Lasting Injury itself is ignored, though the fighter must still go into Recovery. Otherwise the Cyberteknika is damaged and stops working (the fighter can no longer use its benefits), and the fighter then goes into Recovery. Note, however, that none of the other effects of the Lasting Injury are applied against the fighter.\nTo repair a piece of Cyberteknika the fighter must pay half its cost in credits during the pre-battle sequence of any battle, or during downtime in a Campaign.\nCRANIAL CYBERTEKNIKA\n\nCranial Cyberteknika represents any number of cognitive cybernetics or brain implants that repair cortical damage or enhance mnemonic function:\nThis Cyberteknika upgrade repairs the damage caused when a fighter suffers either a Head Injury or Humiliated result on the Lasting Injury table.\nThis Cyberteknika upgrade may be damaged if the fighter suffers either a future Head Injury or Humiliated result on the Lasting Injury table.",

With this in mind, players should feel free to add Cyberteknika to their Necromunda models without the need to convert them \u2013 it can be imagined that the fighter\u2019s enhancements are hidden under their suit or appear identical to the real thing. That said, if a player wants to represent bionic limbs, eyes and other augments (perhaps raiding other kits from the Citadel Miniatures range for parts) then they should be able to do so, for not all Van Saar fighters favour subtlety, and many wear their bionics out in the open for all to see.\nLast updated\u00a0on",

While other clans and Noble Houses have been content to embrace the slavish traditions of the Imperium, in particular its superstitious fear of technology, those of House Van Saar have sought to unravel the mysteries of humanity\u2019s lost age of advancement and progress. At times during their long history, their actions have brought them close to tech-heresy, and only the extreme secrecy of their Archeotek cabals and the benevolence of House Helmawr \u2013 which benefits most from their innovation \u2013 have protected them. This delving into the unknown, however, has taken its toll upon the Van Saar. It is not without good reason that the secrets of the Machine God are sacrosanct to the Adeptus Mechanicus. Those who seek to peek behind the curtain of creation must be ready to pay the price such knowledge brings \u2013 and so it was with House Van Saar.\n\n\nAt the heart of the Clan House is its secret STC, or Standard Template Construct system device. These rare and ancient tools are the most prized of relics to the Adeptus Mechanicus, whose agents and armies are endlessly scouring the galaxy in their quest for these venerated artefacts. Created using long-lost technologies, the STCs were given to colony ships during one of Mankind\u2019s earlier expansions across the stars. Encoded into the imperishable hardware of each machine were the blueprints for all manner of things the colonists might need, from power sources and habitats to armoured vehicles and weapons. In an age during which so much knowledge has been lost to the slow entropy of time, each STC represents a priceless artefact, and in the case of the Van Saar STC, a near infinite source of wealth. It is around this wondrous machine that House Van Saar is built, and it is at once the blessing that affords its members continued existence, and the curse that condemns them to sickness and short lives.\n\n\nGANG COMPOSITION\n\nHouse Van Saar follows the\u00a0\nnormal rules\n\u00a0for Gang Composition.\nSPECIAL RULES\n\nFollow normal rules as other gangs with the following exceptions:\nArchaeo-cyberteknika\nSpecialist Champions do\u00a0\nnot\n\u00a0have Group Activation (1).\nSpecialist Gangers can use Heavy Weapons.\nFIGHTERS\n\n130 CREDITS\nVAN SAAR PRIME (LEADER)",

        "ed8a5c2b-b994-4ed7-b42f-5a31d6e138b5": "ORLOCK TERRAIN\nSource: House of Iron\nGangs often make use of terrain in their battles against their rivals. Sometimes this is whatever is lying around the underhive battlefield, such as barrels for cover or boltholes from which to launch ambushes. Other times they bring the terrain with them, setting up fixed weapon platforms, defensive barricades or piles of ammo crates within easy reach of their fighters.\nOrlock gangs can call upon a number of specialist terrain features to include in their gang. These pieces of terrain are bought from the Trading Post during the post-battle sequence. Once bought, they are added to the gang\u2019s Stash, and can be fielded in any battle the gang plays unless noted otherwise.\nPLACING GANG TERRAIN\n\nGang terrain is placed on the battlefield before any fighters are deployed. A gang can place its terrain in its own deployment zone, or, if noted, in no-man\u2019s-land (i.e., anywhere outside their opponent\u2019s deployment zone and their own deployment zone). Some pieces of terrain (as noted in their descriptions) can only be used if the gang is the defender in a scenario with an attacker and a defender.\nORLOCK TERRAIN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSAWN-OFF SURPRISE (BOOBY TRAP)\n\nSawn-off shotguns are a staple of House Orlock gangs, and find dozens of uses in their crews, including as part of traps to blast unsuspecting foes. A Sawn-off Surprise is a Booby Trap, and follows the rules for Booby Traps. It should be represented by a marker, or model on a 25mm base. When a Sawn-off Surprise explodes, all fighters within 3\" take an automatic hit from a Sawn-off shotgun.\nPROMETHIUM BARRELS\n\nBullet-riddled barrels of waste promethium make for useful hazards when it comes to gang warfare. Orlock gangs will roll these barrels into an area before a fight, where their foul contents can leak out to saturate an area, ideally catching enemy fighters in the slick, hindering their movement and making them prone to burst into flames!\nA Promethium Barrel can be represented by a marker, an appropriate piece of terrain, or a model on a 25mm base. These pieces of terrain may be placed anywhere on the battlefield at least 3\" from the enemy deployment zone. If a fighter, from either crew, activates within 3\" of one of these markers, they can only make a single Move (Simple) action during their activation. In addition, if a fighter within 3\" of a Promethium Barrel is hit by a weapon with the Blaze trait, add 1 to the dice when rolling to see if they are set on fire.\nSERVITOR SENTRY\n\nServitors are used extensively throughout the hives of Necromunda, and House Orlock employs vast numbers of them for the autonomous piloting of transport rigs and cargo sorters. Some of these servitors find their way into Orlock gangs, most gangers favouring \u2018Luggers\u2019 for their size and ability to carry heavy weapons. Many of these are ripped right out of their old machines and lack arms or legs, being little more than a torso driven by mono-programming \u2013 more than enough to operate an autogun.\nA Servitor Sentry can be represented by a marker, an appropriate piece of terrain, or a model on a 25mm base. The servitor can only be deployed when the player\u2019s gang is the defender in a scenario with an attacker and a defender, and then it must be placed within their deployment zone. Servitors cannot move themselves, but can be moved by friendly fighters in the same way as a Loot casket. A Servitor Sentry has the following profile:",

In addition, they automatically pass any Cool or Willpower checks they are required to take and automatically fail any Leadership or Intelligence checks they must make. They do not count for the purposes of Bottle tests, nor can they be included in a Reinforcement deck, and must always be deployed on the battlefield, in addition to the specified crew size.\nEQUIPMENT\n\nA Servitor Sentry may be armed with either an autogun or a shotgun with solid and scatter ammo.\nTOOL BOX\n\nAll Orlock fighters carry tools on their belts, these ubiquitous kits a mark of being a member of the clan, as well as the difference between life and death out in the wastes. Sometimes a gang might bring along heavier equipment to help with the servicing of their weapons, vehicles or servitors. Carried around in old ammo containers, these tool boxes contain everything the gang might need for field repairs.\nA Tool Box can be represented by a marker, an ammo crate or an appropriate model on a 25mm base. A Tool Box can be moved in the same manner as Loot caskets (see the Necromunda Rulebook). A friendly fighter within 1\" of a Tool Box can take one Reload (Simple) action for free when they activate. In addition, a Cyber-mastiff, Ambot, Servitor Sentry or \u2018Lugger\u2019 Cargo Servitor that activates within 1\" of a Tool Box can remove a single Flesh Wound or recover a single lost Wound on a D6 roll of 4+.\nROAD RELIC (GANG RELIC)\n\nHouse Orlock gang relics are altars to the road gods of Necromunda. Fashioned from scavenged parts of destroyed ash-runners, crawlers or mighty war-rigs, they remind the gang of their mastery over the Ash Wastes and its trade routes. Often these relics will be hung with icons of the road, such as wheels, fuel tanks, or battered gun turrets \u2013 some of which still work.\nA Road Relic counts as a Gang Relic (see the Necromunda Rulebook) and can be represented by a marker, an appropriate piece of terrain or a model on a 40mm base. In addition, a friendly fighter in base contact with a Road Relic can crew one of its turrets, using the following profile:\n\n\n\n\nLast updated\u00a0on",

Road Captains, leaders and champions spend their lives amassing legends about themselves, some by doing great deeds \u2013 with plenty of witnesses \u2013 others by letting their followers talk them up in drinking holes and wasteland dives. Whether a legend is true or not, all that matters is that it takes on a life of its own. Soon people start referring to the Orlock by their nickname, which in turn is a self-fulfilling prophecy, as they strive to live up to it no matter what.\nOrlock Legendary Names are special names that can be given to an Orlock Leader or Champion, granting them additional benefits. For example, Orlock Gang Leader Rothgo Jax, could be given the Legendary Name \u2018Iron Hard\u2019, thus becoming Rothgo \u2018Iron Hard\u2019 Jax, and gaining the benefits of the Iron Hard name. Legendary names are not without their cost, however, as the flip side of being a legend is living up to your own hype. Each Legendary Name comes with a drawback, each of which is included as part of the Legendary Name\u2019s special rules.\nUSING LEGENDARY NAMES\n\nLegendary Names are Advancements. They can be purchased for fighters using Experience points, and they can be given to characters when they are recruited:\nAny fighter can have up to two Legendary Names.\nAny fighter with the Gang Hierarchy (X) special rule can have up to three Legendary Names.\nLegendary Names may be taken by fighters as follows:\nLegendary Names can be gained as an Advancement. A fighter may be given a random Legendary Name (from one of the three categories available) for 3 XP, or may choose a Legendary Name for a cost of 6 XP. In both cases, this Advancement increases the fighter\u2019s value by 5 credits. If a fighter gains a random Legendary Name that they cannot use, simply roll again.\nAny fighter with the Gang Hierarchy (X) special rule may choose a Legendary Name when they are recruited, as well as choosing a skill (as described in their profile).\nUNBELIEVABLE ESCAPES\n\nSome fighters are just impossible to kill. The ganger has a reputation for surviving things no ordinary person should \u2013 shrugging off rounds to the chest, stepping out of the way of incoming fire like they were dodging a punch, or snapping off knives driven into their gut, before knocking the attacker on their backside.\n1. IRON HARD\n\nThis fighter counts the first Serious Injury or Out of Action result they suffer during any battle as a Flesh Wound instead. However, if this fighter is taken Out of Action, their crew will automatically fail the next Bottle test it is required to make.\n2. BULLET DODGER\n\nOnce per battle, when an enemy fighter makes a ranged attack that targets this fighter, you can force that enemy fighter to re-roll all successful to hit rolls made as part of that ranged attack. During this fighter\u2019s next activation after this ability has been used, they can only make Move (Simple) actions.\n3. BADZONE LEGEND\n\nThis fighter can make a special 3+ save roll against any damage sustained as a result of any environmental hazard (i.e., damage not originating from an attack by another fighter). During this fighter\u2019s next activation after this ability has been used, they cannot initiate or take part in Group Activations.\n4. PROMETHIUM-PROOF KILLER\n\nThis fighter ignores all of the effects of the Blaze trait. However, this fighter cannot benefit from or utilise the Leading by Example special rule.\n5. SLIPPERY SCUMMER\n\nIf the fighter is ever captured (see the Necromunda Rulebook), they can choose to have another fighter from their gang be captured in their place. If this ability is used and another fighter is taken captive in this way, then the gang cannot and will not attempt a Rescue of that fighter.\n6. BLADE BREAKER\n\nWhen this fighter is hit by an attack made by an enemy fighter using a weapon with either the Melee trait, the Versatile trait, or both, immediately roll a D6. On a roll of a natural 6, the hit automatically becomes a miss and the enemy fighter is immediately Disarmed (just as if they had been hit on a roll of 6 by a weapon with the Disarm trait).\nIMPRESSIVE LEADERSHIP\n\nIn the underhive, it takes a big personality to lead a gang, and an even bigger one to be remembered after you\u2019re on your way to the corpse-starch factorum.",

Impressive leaders intimidate those around them, use their guns to make unforgettable statements and get extra creds just for turning up.\n1. BIGMAN\n\nWhen this fighter makes a Group Activation, they may include fighters within 6\" rather than the usual 3\". However, this fighter must reduce the benefit of any cover they are in by 1 (i.e., while in Full Cover, enemy fighters only suffer a -1 modifier to their hit rolls when targeting this fighter, rather than the usual -2).\n2. LUCKY\n\nOnce per battle, this fighter can change the result of any one dice they have rolled to a 6 (you may decide to use this ability after the dice have been rolled). However, in a battle that uses the Reinforcement rules, this fighter\u2019s Fighter card must be placed in the Reinforcement deck.\n3. IMPRESSIVE SCARS\n\nAs long as a friendly fighter has a line of sight to this fighter, the distance between that fighter and this fighter does not matter for the purposes of the Leading by Example special rule. However, this fighter must reduce the number of fighters they can include in a Group Activation by 1.\n4. TOO PRETTY FOR PRIMUS\n\nIf this fighter is still on the battlefield at the end of a battle, their gang adds 2D6x5 credits to their Stash. However, if a double is rolled, these credits are added to your opponent\u2019s Stash instead.\n5. IRON STARE\n\nEnemy fighters wishing to target this fighter with a ranged attack must first pass a Cool check if this fighter has a line of sight to that enemy fighter. In addition, this fighter never counts as the closest fighter for the purposes of Target Priority.\n6. ROCK STEADY\n\nAs long as this fighter is Standing and Active, or Standing and Engaged, you can roll two D6 for Bottle tests and apply the lowest result. However, if your gang fails its Bottle test, friendly fighters must reroll a successful Cool check to see if they flee the battlefield.\nIMPROBABLE BEAT-DOWNS\n\nEvery Orlock has a tale of the time they knocked some underhive killer for six \u2013 some of them are even true! Leaders with legendary reputations about their combat prowess are said to be able to kill a foe with a single punch or land a bullet between their enemy\u2019s eyes from the other side of a dome!\n1. ONE PUNCH\n\nWhen making an unarmed attack (see the Necromunda Rulebook) this fighter may choose to roll a single Attack dice, irrespective of their Attacks characteristic or any other bonuses. If this attack hits, it is resolved at Strength 8 and Damage 2, and no Save roll can be made (with the exception of Field armour).\n2. BULLET LORD\n\nOnce per battle, rather than rolling the Firepower dice, this fighter can choose the result of the dice roll to be a 3. However, after working out the effects of the attack, the fighter\u2019s weapon counts as having failed an Ammo check.\n3. TWO-GUNS\n\nWhen this fighter uses the Twin Guns Blazing rule, after working out the effect of their attacks, enemy fighters within 6\" must make a Nerve test. However, during any round in which this fighter uses the Twin Gun Blazing rule they cannot make, or participate in, a Group Activation.\n4. CHANCER\n\nWhenever this fighter hits an enemy fighter with an Improbable Shot, they gain D3 XP. When spending Experience on skill Advancements, this fighter cannot choose skills, and must always gain a randomly determined new skill instead.\n5.

        "8636f8af-5c45-4ba1-a491-ff59796bdc34": "HOUSE ORLOCK\nThey say the Orlocks have iron in their souls. But then you\u2019d have to be made of the black ore of Necromunda to climb the spider\u2019s web of Lord Helmawr\u2019s feudal society as quickly as they have. In just three short millennia, House Orlock has risen from a loose alliance of Clan Families and waste prospectors to become the largest mining operation on the planet. It is a success built upon the backs of a massive slave underclass, the Drudges, born to scrape ore from the dark pits of the Spoil, or work endless cycles in the clan\u2019s smoke- wreathed refineries. House Orlock has had a troubled history with this underclass, and at times they have threatened to rise up and tear down everything the Clan Families have fought to build. It speaks to the ruthlessness and determination of these families that they managed to endure these rebellions, ultimately building their entire social structure around the simmering discontentment within their ranks.\nFrom the outside, however, the troubled history of the Drudges is largely unknown, or at the very least discounted, and it is not these unwashed masses that most consider when they think of the Orlocks. The image of the House of Iron is one of veteran rebels, outland ash-riders and bare-knuckled hardmen. This is entirely intentional, and the heads of the Orlock mining families have worked long and hard to cultivate a soldier class within the clan to fight for its interests, and keep the drudging classes in line. At the top of the Orlock social ladder, a small group of families hold power over millions of subjects, who, should they ever unite, could sweep this ruling class away in a single violent uprising. It is only the clan\u2019s gangs that stand in the way of these would-be rebels. As paradoxical as it might seem, most of these gangs come from the drudging classes themselves, selected for their rebellious nature and fierce independence. Thus do the ruling families weed out troublemakers before they have a chance to incite rebellion, and turn them back upon their own kind, with a promise of freedom and power.\nGANG COMPOSITION\n\nHouse Orlock follows the\u00a0\nnormal rules\n\u00a0for Gang Composition.\nSPECIAL RULES\n\nFollow normal rules as other gangs with the following exceptions:\nHouse Orlock has access to\u00a0\nLegendary Names\n, which are given to Leaders/Champions when created and can be purchased with XP as they advance.\nSpecialist Gangers can use Heavy Weapons.\nFIGHTERS\n\n105CREDITS\nROAD CAPTAIN (LEADER)\n\n\n\nSkills:\n\u00a01 Primary (custom).\nRestrictions:\n\u00a0None.\nSpecial Rules:\n\u00a0Gang Leader, Gang Hierarchy (Leader), Tools of the Trade, Group Activation (2).\nRoad Captains are without exception hard men and women, willing to thumb their nose at authority and forge their own path. However, Orlock gangers respect independence as much as strength, and a successful Road Captain needs to be the embodiment of both of these traits. Being a Road Captain means earning the respect of their gang through their own deeds. Unlike some gangs and clans of Necromunda, the brotherhoods and sisterhoods of House Orlock are a two-way street; if a leader in the House of Iron wants to have men and women follow them, then they had best be worthy of the right.\n80CREDITS\nROAD SERGEANT (CHAMPION)\n\n\n\nSkills:\n\u00a01 Primary (custom).\nRestrictions:\n\u00a0None.\nSpecial Rules:\n\u00a0Gang Hierarchy (Champion), Tools of the Trade, Group Activation (1).\nA good Road Sergeant can take orders from their Captain, but has enough initiative to break the rules to get the job done.

Road Captains rely on their Arms Masters to enforce order within their gang, as well as leading by example \u2013 usually cracking heads or setting their cyber- mastiffs on those who cross the gang. To be an Arms Master means being hard as nails, even by the standards of House Orlock, and there are countless stories about these stony-faced fighters getting stabbed, blasted or shot and getting back up to make their enemies pay for making them mad.\n45CREDITS\nGUNNER (GANGER)\n\n\n\nRestrictions:\n\u00a0Pistol, Basic, Close Combat.\nSpecial Rules:\n\u00a0Gang Fighter (Ganger), Promotion (Orlock Specialist), Tools of the Trade (Orlock Specialist).\nThe bulk of Orlock gangs are made up of Gunners, hive-hardened men and women with a rebellious streak a mile wide.

Among the members of House Orlock these risk-takers are the Wreckers. In the tangled confines of the underhive, they jump among the gantries and tumbled domes taking out enemy fighters \u2013 while at the same time making sure they don\u2019t take their head off on a low-hanging ceiling or end up as a stain on the floor from a bad landing.\n35CREDITS\nGREENHORN (JUVE)\n\n\n\nRestrictions:\n\u00a0Pistol, Basic and Close Combat.\nSpecial Rules:\n\u00a0Gang Fighter (Juve), Promotion (Orlock Specialist), Fast Learner.\nThere is always a steady supply of Greenhorns signing up for the gangs, eager to escape the crushing brutality of existence in the drudging classes.\n230CREDITS\n0-1 SERVITOR (BRUTE)\n\nCost:\n\u00a0230\n\n\nWargear:\n\u00a0Harpoon launcher, Open Fist (same as: servitor combat weapon),\u00a0\nLight carapace (4+)\n.\nSpecial Rules:\n\u00a0Ammo Hoppers, Weapons Platform.\nOPTIONS",

Most often, the human component of aservitor is harvested from a convicted criminal, one whose crimes are deemed toogreat to allow them to carry on as a part of Imperial society but who may continueto serve in another form rather than be wasted in incarceration or execution. Servitors possess the most rudimentary of human intelligence, their minds scrubbed of past memories and all but the most essential knowledge, artificial memory engrams grafted in their place so that they will know their designated roleand function and little else. Servitors are put to work in all manner of industry andfor any menial task with which an unmodified human cannot perform. They work inhostile environments, their living flesh variously blasted by extremes of heat and cold, eroded by extreme elements, or withered and wasted by toxic surroundings, performing their tasks until they fail, at which point their mechanics are reclaimedand a new human \u2018donor\u2019 grafted into place. House Orlock has ready access to mining and heavy industry servitors of all makes and manner, but those repurposedfor gang warfare often take the form referred to by the gangers as \u2018Luggers\u2019 \u2013 heavy, tracked units able to lift, move and carry bulky cargos.

However, they do still have loyal friends amongst the people. Guilders breed and keep large hounds to protect their caravans and holdings, and House Orlock in particular takes great pride in the rearing of dogs as guards and fighters. The dogs of House Orlock show great diversity of type. From the sleek, alert watch dogs they raise to guard their mine workings and store houses, to the stocky, bull-like fighting dogs they breed for sport, Orlock Gangers are frequently accompanied by hounds. What\u2019s more, to the outsider, there is a strange sentimentality shown by Orlocks towards their dogs, and it is not uncommon to see hounds sporting expensive cybernetics to compensate for past injuries or illness.\n80CREDITS\nOUTRIDER QUAD (VEHICLE)\n\n\n\nLocomotion:\n\u00a0Wheeled.\nUpgrade Slots:\n\u00a00 Body, 1 Drive, 2 Engine.\nWeapon Hardpoints:\n\u00a01.

        "f19cbab5-7243-4ee4-9825-9c5db37b55e0": "GOLIATH TERRAIN\nSource: House of Chains\nGangs often make use of terrain in their battles against their rivals. Sometimes this is whatever is lying around the underhive battlefield, such as barrels for cover or boltholes from which to launch ambushes. Other times they bring the terrain with them, setting up fixed weapon platforms, defensive barricades or piles of ammo crates within easy reach of their fighters.\nGoliath gangs can call upon a number of specialist terrain features to include in their gang. These pieces of terrain are bought from the Trading Post during the post-battle sequence. Once bought, they are added to the gang\u2019s Stash, and can be fielded in any battle the gang takes part in unless noted otherwise.\nPLACING GANG TERRAIN\n\nGang terrain is placed on the battlefield before any fighters are deployed, but after other terrain has been set up. A gang can place its terrain in its own deployment area, or, if noted, in no-man's-land (i.e., anywhere outside both their opponent\u2019s deployment zone and their own deployment zone). Some pieces of terrain (as noted in their descriptions) can only be used if the gang is the defender in a scenario with an attacker and a defender.\nGOLIATH TERRAIN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTE\nMODELLING GOLIATH TERRAIN\n\nMany of the gang-specific terrain detailed here can be represented by items from the Necromunda model range. For example, Amneo Canisters can be represented by Ammo Crates with appropriate gang markings, while Furnace Barricades can be represented by appropriately-marked Necromunda barricades. A Heavy Rivet Cannon could be created using a rivet cannon (such as a spare one from the Goliath gang sprue) fixed to a base. Others, such as the Pillar of Chains, can be represented by any appropriate marker, or a girder or pole on a base, hung with chains, while a Relic of the Forge could be anything from a marker to a suitably impressive piece of industrial terrain, painted in the colours of the gang and hung with Goliath icons.\nAMNEO CANISTERS\n\nThese contain the vital fluids of the growth vats, and can be used by Goliaths to rapidly heal wounds.\nA Goliath fighter within 3\" of an Amneo Canister can remove a single Flesh Wound during the End phase of any round.\nFURNACE BARRICADE\n\nHeavy heat shields can be found throughout Goliath forges. Gangs often turn these thick plates into makeshift barricades where their folded ceramite layers prove especially effective against flamers and melta weaponry.\nA Goliath gang can place its Furnace Barricades anywhere in its deployment area or in no-man's-land. A fighter within 1\" of a Furnace Barricade ignores both the Blaze or Melta traits when suffering hits, provided the barricade is granting them cover against the origin of the hit.\nHEAVY RIVET CANNON\n\nRivet guns and cannon are a vital tool of the Goliath factories, the heaviest examples are fixed to tripods or tracked carriages and supplied with an abundance of ammo. Unsurprisingly, gangs turn these tools into weapons, hauling them into position to cover corridors and doorways.\nGoliath gangs can only include Heavy Rivet Cannon if they are the defender in a scenario with an attacker and defender. A Heavy Rivet Cannon uses the following profile:\n\n\n\n\nPILLAR OF CHAINS (GANG RELIC)\n\nGoliaths often use crude iron spikes hung with chains as a convenient method of securing slaves. Captives are dragged back to the Pillar of Chains, and locked in place for later transportation back to the Goliath enclave.\nWhen a gang with a Pillar of Chains has a chance to capture enemy fighters, it may re-roll one or both of the dice.\nRELIC OF THE FORGE (GANG RELIC)\n\nForge relics are pieces of broken machinery that have been reshaped into a totem pole of clan icons and industrial weaponry. Gangs often use these to mark the boundaries of their territories, the grinning iron faces beaten into their sides a warning to trespassers.\nA Relic of the Forge counts as a Gang Relic (see the Necromunda Rulebook). In addition, Goliath fighters within 3\" of a Relic of the Forge ignore the effects of the Disarm trait and can re-roll failed Ammo checks. Enemy fighters who end their activation within 3\" of a Relic of the Forge must make a Nerve test (see the Necromunda Rulebook) or become Broken.\nGoliath gangs can only include a Relic of the Forge if they are the defender in a scenario with an attacker and defender.\nLast updated\u00a0on",
        "fb0b5423-1bee-43e1-8c14-3b7626fcfb2e": "GOLIATH GENE-SMITHING\nSource: House of Chains\nGoliaths are unique among the denizens of Necromunda, as they were grown for a purpose, rather than having evolved through chance; that purpose being to work the factories of the hive world. Engineered to be hardy and resilient, as well as strong and stoic, they excel in their task, though the legacy of their creation continues to shape them. Even when the Clan House broke away from its creators and earned its freedom, it took with it this heritage of genetic manipulation. The Goliaths\u2019 gene-smithed past means there remains substantial genetic variance within each clan enclave and gang, each drawing their lineage from a different bio-lab, or Alpha. Some represent the best of their kind, toughest of the tough, and are blessed with the most valuable genetic gifts. While others carry biological missteps, their strength and toughness won at a price to their minds or their longevity. Then there are those that are barely true Goliaths at all, their bodies carrying the weakest of the clan\u2019s genetics, even though their loyalty to the Over-tyrant remains undiminished.\nUSING GENE-SMITHING\n\nGoliath Gene-smithing is a collection of rules allowing players to further customise their gangs by determining the genetic legacy of their fighters. They provide a huge amount of variety within a Goliath gang, and can be used to create small elite gangs of genetically superior Natborn, flesh-cursed gangs of Vatborn suffering from the biological tampering of their creators, or even gangs of aspiring Unborn who share few of the benefits of the Goliaths but who hope to prove themselves to the clan. Players can also run baseline Goliath gangs without spending any extra credits on Gene-smithing, simply by running gangs of Vatborn without any upgrades.\nTo use these rules, fighters must choose a sub-type (Natborn, Vatborn or Unborn) when they are added to the gang \u2013 Vatborn being the default sub-type. The cost of their sub-type is added to the fighter\u2019s credits cost, as detailed in the House Goliath gang list. Other upgrades are optional, and can be added to fighters using the following guidelines:\nFighters can only be Gene-smithed when they are added to the gang. Under unusual circumstances the Arbitrator might allow a fighter to be Genesmithed during campaign downtime.\nThe fighter can only select Gene-smithing upgrades from those available to their sub-type (as detailed on the Vatborn, Natborn and Unborn tables as follows):\n\tFighters with the Gang fighter (Juve), (Prospect) or (Ganger) special rule can have a maximum of one Gene-smithed upgrade.\n\tFighters with the Gang Hierarchy (Leader) or (Champion) special rule may have a maximum of two Gene-smithed upgrades.\nCustomise the gang by determining the genetic legacy of the fighters. New fighters added to the gang can be given one of the following origins (affecting cost and gang rating).\nGOLIATH SUB-TYPES\n\n\n\n\n\nINFO\nCHARACTERISTIC CHANGES\n\nSome Gene-smithed upgrades either increase or decrease the characteristics of a fighter. After these changes have been made, the fighter\u2019s new profile is considered to be their base profile for the purposes of Maximum Characteristics (see the Necromunda Rulebook). If a fighter has multiple Gene-smithed upgrades that alter their characteristics, then the effects are combined, either adding together or cancelling each other out.\nVATBORN FIGHTERS\n\nVatborn fighters make up the vast majority of Goliath gangs, and have all the usual gifts and drawbacks of their kind. They are, however, the most mutable of their clan, and have available to them a wide variety of options for genetic tampering, many having been grown for particular environments or purposes. Vatborn fighters have the Baseline Goliath special rule:\nBASELINE GOLIATH\n\nEven without the genetic manipulation common within the clans, a Goliath is an impressive specimen. Vatborn fighters represent the baseline of the Goliath genetic line, and have no specific benefits or drawbacks.\nWhen added to the gang, Vatborn fighters can choose from any of the Genesmithed upgrades opposite, adjusting the credits cost of the fighter accordingly. Note that some \u2018upgrades\u2019 have a negative cost. These represent flaws and deficiencies that weaken the fighter in some way. In these instances, the cost of the upgrade is deducted from the fighter\u2019s base cost as shown in the Goliath gang list.\nVATBORN GENE-SMITHED UPGRADES",

Without the physical strength to dominate rivals or to endure the hardships of Necromunda, a Goliath is nothing. They were created as a slave race to work the refineries and forges of Necromunda and toil in places where even hardy Necromundans could not survive, and while the members of the clan are practically abhuman in their size and strength, only fools underestimate their resourcefulness and low cunning. It was the folly of their creators, who believed the Goliaths could be kept docile and ignorant though genetic meddling, that allowed elements of the clan to gain their independence. Ironically, no sooner had the Goliaths gained their freedom from their creators than they enslaved themselves again through the creation of a savage hierarchy. From among their ranks, the strongest rose to dominate domes and hives, culminating in the ascendance of the Over-tyrant, the lord of all the Goliaths on Necromunda. This overlord holds dominion over the clan via the flow of life-giving stimms \u2013 chem cocktails essential to the continued existence of all Goliaths. The clan\u2019s reverence of strength, however, grants the Over-tyrant this right, and while the members of House Goliath once rebelled against outside control, they willingly accept rulership by one of their own.\nGoliaths are unique among the peoples of Necromunda, being on the whole gene-smithed beings, forged from a stable genus of humanity but enhanced for strength and endurance. Whether or not Goliaths are, in fact, abhumans remains a subject of much debate among the representatives of the Adeptus Terra on Necromunda, though the Imperium has deemed them \u2018sanctioned\u2019 for use on the hive world under the proviso that Lord Helmawr monitors their development. To date, most Goliaths are still largely created through esoteric biological means \u2013 rapidly grown in amneo-vats from flesh-templates and turned out into the refineries and factories for immediate hard labour. These brutish creations are mostly male and mostly sterile, living for less than a decade on a diet of backbreaking work and growth stimms before their bodies fail and they die. Despite this short life-span, Goliaths are born with a baseline knowledge of their world and their position in it, delivered via a cranial data-slug. During the years of slavery, this mnemonic injection was intended to keep the Goliaths ignorant and included only the basest information, keeping them at a learning level akin to a small child or a clever animal. After the Goliaths won their freedom, the Alphas ensured that the data-slug was altered to include the collected knowledge and experience of the Goliaths who had come before. In this way, the Goliaths share the knowledge of the clan gathered over hundreds of generations, giving them a working understanding of everything from hive industries to clan weaponry.\nGANG COMPOSITION\n\nHouse Goliath follows the\u00a0\nnormal rules\n\u00a0for Gang Composition.\nSPECIAL RULES\n\nFollow normal rules as other gangs with the following exceptions:\nGene-smithing\n.\nSpecialist Champion does not have Group Activation (1).\nFIGHTERS\n\n135CREDITS\nGOLIATH FORGE TYRANT (LEADER)\n\n\n\nRestrictions:\n\u00a0None.\nSpecial Rules:\n\u00a0Gang Leader, Gang Hierarchy (Leader), Tools of the Trade, Group Activation (2).\nSpecial Rules\nSkill Access\nEquipment\nLore\nSource: House of Chains\n100CREDITS\nGOLIATH FORGE BOSS (CHAMPION)\n\n\n\nRestrictions:\n\u00a0None.\nSpecial Rules:\n\u00a0Gang Hierarchy (Champion), Tools of the Trade, Group Activation (1).\nSpecial Rules\nSkill Access\nEquipment\nLore\n125CREDITS\nSTIMMER (SPECIALIST CHAMPION)\n\n\n\nRestrictions:\n\u00a0Pistol, Heavy and Close Combat.\nSpecial Rules:\n\u00a0Gang Hierarchy (Champion), Tools of the Trade, Combat Chems Stash.\nSpecial Rules\nSkill Access\nEquipment\nLore\n35CREDITS\nGOLIATH FORGE-BORN (PROSPECT)\n\n\n\nRestrictions:\n\u00a0Pistol, Special, Close Combat.\nSpecial Rules:\n\u00a0Gang Fighter (Prospect), Tools of the Trade, Promotion (Goliath Forge Boss or Goliath Stimmer), Hot-headed, Fast Learner.\nSpecial Rules\nSkill Access\nEquipment\nLore\n55CREDITS\nGOLIATH BRUISER (GANGER)",

Many Goliath infants are vat-grown, the better to ensure a healthy specimen, whilst others are born of Goliath parents deemed suitable to reproduce for their adherence to the Goliath physical ideal. Whatever the infant\u2019s origin, from an early age House Goliath utilises all manner of artificial assistance to boost its members\u2019 abilities to superhuman levels, be it through the use of combat stimms or other, more esoteric drugs brokered through dealings with House Escher, or the genetic manipulation of their young, up to and including the surgical grafting on of huge volumes of extra muscle mass. There are almost no limits to which the members of House Goliath will not go in their pursuit of what they deem to be the physical ideal. Indeed, this manipulation of their form has gone on for so many centuries that there are those within the Administratum and the Adeptus Mechanicus who believe that many of House Goliath have evolved to become a distinct sub-set of abhuman unique to Necromunda. This is quite alarming considering that gen-hancement and vat-grown muscle grafting is common across the Imperium, and speaks volumes about the levels to which House Goliath has taken these practices.\nSuch abuse of growth stimms, surgeries and other methods is not without risks, however, as even the most baseline of Goliaths will show noticeable reductions in cognitive function. For Goliaths that push the limits of their physical form to the extreme, the risks are even greater. Rampant and uncontrollable muscle growth, spontaneous bone spur mutations, metabolisms that rage out of control and total loss of all higher brain functions are common. Such post-human flesh hulks are frequently seen in the gangs of the underhive, where in the crude parlance of the gangs they are called \u2018Zerkers\u2019, bringing rampant destruction to the foes of their house.\n120CREDITS\n0-1 SUMPKROC (EXOTIC BEAST)",

Imported as eggs, once hatched these snappy little creatures were seen everywhere for a period of several seasons, kept in fine artificial habitats or carried around in specially-made hand luggage. They became almost common, rapidly\u2026\nBut as they became common, so too did they become big, and with size came increased aggression. Many were culled after accidents led to lost digits, even lost limbs, and in some cases, so the legends go, loss of life. Many more were hurriedly discarded down waste chutes and heat sinks. And so, in the fullness of time, many were found by the denizens of the underhive. Over time, these strange creatures were captured as a new food source, but that practice ended as they were more likely to make food of their human hunters.\nAnd there their story might have ended in extinction, but for the intervention of House Goliath. For some inexplicable reason, the Goliaths were attracted to these creatures as pets, taking pride in their size and strength, and revelling in their ferocity.\nToday, the Sumpkrocs that House Goliath keep are somewhat different to the original creature, with centuries of genetic cloning causing a few changes and they no longer wholly resemble the creature first imported\u2026\n100CREDITS\nMAULER (VEHICLE)\n\n\n\nType:\n\u00a0Hybrid drive (wheeled & tracked).\nUpgrade Slots:\n\u00a02 Body, 1 Drive, 1 Engine.\nWeapon Locomotion:\n\u00a01 (Crew: Front).\nPOWER RAM\n\nImprove S, AP and D by 2 for vehicle impacts involving this vehicle's front arc.\n25CREDITS\nROAD THUG (CREW)",
        "d1827a9d-7561-4881-b526-b4a884916a52": "ESCHER TERRAIN\nSource: House of Blades\nGangs often make cunning use of terrain in their battles against their rivals. Sometimes this is whatever is lying around the underhive battlefield, such as barrels for cover or boltholes from which to launch ambushes. Other times they bring the terrain with them, setting up fixed weapon platforms, defensive barricades or piles of ammo crates within easy reach of their fighters.\nEscher gangs can call upon a number of specialist terrain features to include in their gang. These pieces of terrain are bought from the Trading Post during the post-battle sequence. Once bought, they are added to the gang\u2019s stash, and can be fielded in any battle the gang plays unless noted otherwise.\nPLACING GANG TERRAIN\n\nGang terrain is placed on the battlefield before any fighters are deployed. A gang can place its terrain in its own deployment area, or, if noted, in no-man\u2019s-land (i.e., anywhere outside their opponent\u2019s deployment zone and their own deployment zone). Some pieces of terrain (as noted in their descriptions) can only be used if the gang is the defender in a scenario with an attacker and a defender.\nESCHER TERRAIN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nINFO\nHIDDEN TRAPS\n\nSome traps are cunningly hidden among the gloom and debris of the underhive, fighters not knowing if a pile of rubble is just more rubbish or a deadly surprise. If a trap uses the Hidden Traps rule then it is represented on the battlefield by not one but six markers. These markers can be tokens, or appropriate terrain elements on 25mm bases. When preparing these markers, one out of the six is the real trap (mark its underside, or secretly make a note to determine which one is real), the others are false traps. When a fighter triggers a trap, as detailed in the trap\u2019s description, it is revealed. False traps are discarded while the real trap remains on the board. Note that even when the real trap is revealed, other false traps remain on the board until they have been interacted with \u2013 this is important if more than one trap is in play, as it will keep the enemy guessing as to just how many traps remain to be discovered.\nGAS CANISTERS\n\nEscher gas canisters are homemade containers for the gang\u2019s toxic compounds or airborne chems. In battle, a ganger can tap one of these makeshift containers to reload their gas weapons or give them an extra boost. The danger of having so much poisonous gas in one place, of course, is if a stray round ruptures them, they can saturate an area in toxins, killing friend and foe alike.\nGas Canisters can be represented by a marker, or an appropriate model placed on a 25mm base. Gas Canisters can be moved in the same manner as Loot caskets (see the Necromunda Rulebook). A friendly fighter within 1\" of a Gas Canister can use it as if it were chem-synth, increasing the lethality of their Gas weapons. Note that unlike a normal chem-synth, a Gas Canister can only be used to enhance weapons with the Gas trait.\nGas Canisters can be targeted by ranged attacks just as if they were fighters, and may be affected by Blast and Template weapons if they are touched by a Blast marker or Template marker. Gas Canisters have a Toughness of 3, and if they take any damage are destroyed and removed from the battlefield. When a Gas Canister is destroyed, place a 3\" Blast marker over its position before removing it from the battlefield. All fighters touched by this marker take a hit from a weapon with the Gas trait.\nBLADE CAGES (TRAP)\n\nBlade Cages are cruel but effective mantraps. With pressure plates or tripwires to set them off, they are bladed claws that rise up from the ground or descend from the ceiling to envelop their victims. Those caught in a Blade Cage are left with the unenviable task of trying to struggle free, hoping they don\u2019t cut themselves to pieces in the process.\nBlade Cages are Traps, and use the Hidden Traps rules. Blade Cages can be set up anywhere on the battlefield outside of your opponent\u2019s deployment area.\nWhen an enemy fighter moves within 2\" of a Blade Cage marker, they must immediately stop and make an Initiative check. If this check is passed, they can continue their movement as normal. If it is failed, flip over the marker to see if it is the real trap as per the Hidden Traps rule. If it is a false trap, discard the marker. If it is the real trap, the fighter is moved into base contact with the marker and gains the Webbed condition.",

If it is a false trap, discard the marker. If it is the real trap, the fighter is moved into base contact with the marker and gains the Webbed condition. As long as a Blade Cage has trapped a fighter, it cannot trap additional fighters, and fighters moving past it do not need to make Initiative checks to see if they are caught.\nBlade Cages can be removed by performing the Disarm (Basic) Action and passing an Intelligence check, while within 1\" of the marker. If this check is failed, the fighter becomes trapped as detailed above.\nDECAPITATORS (TRAP)\n\nDecapitators are far less subtle versions of Blade Cages. Using spring-loaded or pneumatic driven blades, they make for savage and messy booby traps.\nDecapitators are Traps and use the Hidden Traps rules. Decapitators can be set up anywhere on the battlefield outside of your opponent\u2019s deployment area.\nWhen an enemy fighter moves within 2\" of a Decapitator marker, they must immediately stop and make an Initiative check. If this check is passed, they can continue their movement as normal. If it is failed, flip over the marker to see if it is the real trap. If it is a false trap, discard the marker. If it is the real trap, the fighter must immediately roll an Injury dice and apply the results.\nDecapitators can be removed by performing the Disarm (Basic) Action and passing an Intelligence check, while within 1\" of the marker. If this check is failed, the fighter must roll an Injury dice as detailed above.\nGAS CENSERS\n\nGas Censers hung from domes or doorways slowly release toxins into the air. They can be represented by either a marker or a piece of terrain on a 25mm base. Gas Censers can be set up anywhere on the battlefield outside of your opponent\u2019s deployment area.\nIn the End phase, a fighter within 3\" of a Gas Censer must make a Toughness check, adding any bonuses to the roll for Wargear and armour that protects against weapons with the Gas trait. If this check is failed, or the roll was a 6, the fighter suffers an immediate Flesh Wound.\nGas Censers can be thrown by a friendly fighter in base contact with them, just as if they were a grenade. Work out this attack as normal, counting the Gas Censer as a Choke Gas grenade. Once the attack has been worked out, remove the marker from the battlefield.\nCHYMIST CULT RELIC (GANG RELIC)\n\nHouse Escher gang relics are altars to the Chymist Cults. Whether they are massive bladed icons of the House, or spiked pillars hung with the trophies of the gang\u2019s kills, they incorporate chem-stills and toxin filters. A Chymist Cult Relic counts as a Gang Relic (see the Necromunda Rulebook). In addition, a friendly fighter within 3\" of a Chymist Cult Relic can use it as if it were chem-synth, increasing the lethality of their Gas and Toxin weapons. Seriously Injured friendly fighters within 3\" of a Chymist Cult Relic count as being assisted by a friendly fighter making Recovery rolls.\nEnemy fighters who end their activation within 3\" of a Chymist Cult Relic must make a Toughness check, adding any bonuses to the roll for Wargear and armour that protects against weapons with the Gas trait, or immediately suffer a Flesh Wound.\nEscher gangs can only include a Chymist Cult Relic if they are the defender in a scenario with an attacker and defender. A Chymist Cult Relic can be represented by an appropriate marker or a suitably impressive piece of industrial terrain, painted in the colours of the gang and hung with Escher icons.\nNote that if the relic is defiled (see the Necromunda Rulebook), it loses the bonuses it provides to Cool and Leadership checks, but retains its other benefits.\nLast updated\u00a0on",

All manner of stimms, chems and toxins are available to Gang Queens and their fighters, enhancing their natural abilities and making even the slightest scratch of their stiletto knives and swords exceptionally deadly. In addition to the standard selection of chems, toxins and poisonous gases available on Necromunda, House Escher gangs can buy speciality concoctions and compounds from those detailed below.\nUSING CHEM-ALCHEMY\n\nWhen an Escher gang visits the Trading Post during the post-battle sequence, they can buy a Chem-alchemy Elixir in the Purchase Equipment step. Chem-alchemy Elixirs are considered to be part of the gang\u2019s House Equipment List, and so do not require a Seek Rare Equipment roll to be purchased.\nWhen a gang buys a Chem-alchemy Elixir, they must decide what kind of chem (Stimm, Toxic Ammo or Gaseous Ammo) it will be, and what its effects will be. This is done when it is purchased, and will affect its final cost. Creating a Chem-alchemy Elixir is done using the following steps:\nChoose a chem type either: Stimm, Toxic Ammo or Gaseous Ammo\nChoose up to three effects from the chosen chem\u2019s effect list\nAdd up the credit cost of each effect to find the final cost of the chem\nEach time a chem is bought, regardless of the number of effects it includes, it represents a single dose or application.\nA dose or application lasts for the duration of a single battle (unless otherwise noted) then it is used up and removed from the gang\u2019s stash.\nSTIMMS\n\nStimms are beneficial chems fighters use to heal themselves, enhance their fighting abilities, or protect themselves against poisons and other perils. A stimm counts as Wargear. A fighter can start a battle under the effects of any stimm they are equipped with if they choose, or can administer that stimm during a battle to themselves or a friendly fighter in base contact by performing an\u00a0\nAdminister Dose (Simple)\n\u00a0action during their activation.",

Night Night uses bio-anaesthesitics to put the subject into a healing coma.\nEffect:\n\u00a0When a fighter under the effects of this stimm goes Out of Action, do not roll for a Lasting Injury. Instead, the fighter counts as having rolled a result of 12-26 Out Cold on the Lasting Injury table.

Their effects expire during the Wrap-up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBLEEDING\n\nAnticoagulant compounds are laced into the toxin, causing wounds to bleed freely once inflicted.\nEffect:\n\u00a0If a fighter is Injured by a weapon with the Toxin trait with this Toxic Ammo applied, and is not taken Out of Action, place a marker on their Fighter card. At the beginning of each End phase, each of these markers is removed and replaced with a Flesh Wound.\nCONCENTRATED\n\nConcentrated toxins have a short-lived potency, but are highly effective at delivering a strong dose of poison right into the heart of their victims.\nEffect:\n\u00a0The first time a weapon with the Toxin trait with this Toxic Ammo applied hits an enemy fighter, add 2 to the dice roll to see if it overcomes the fighter\u2019s Toughness. Note that this Toxic Ammo only affects this weapon\u2019s first successful hit, and any subsequent hits, even during the same action, will be worked out as normal.\nDEBILITATING\n\nDebilitating toxins can cause blindness, partial paralysis, or enfeeblement.\nEffect:\n\u00a0If a fighter is Injured by a weapon with the Toxin trait with this Toxic Ammo applied, and is not taken Out of Action, place a marker on their Fighter card. For each marker on their Fighter card, a fighter must subtract 1 from any Characteristic checks they are required to make. At the end of the battle, or if the fighter goes Out of Action, remove these markers from their Fighter card.\nDECAYING\n\nNecrotic acids are used to create toxins that can not only poison living organisms but also eat away at armour making their victims more vulnerable to further harm.\nEffect:\n\u00a0If a fighter is Injured by a weapon with the Toxin trait with this Toxic Ammo applied, and is not taken Out of Action, place a marker on their Fighter card. For each marker on their Fighter card, a fighter must subtract 1 from any Save rolls they are required to make. At the end of the battle, or if the fighter goes Out of Action, remove these markers from their Fighter card.\nEXPLODING",

Under one name or another, they can trace their lineage back to the age of Martek Helm\u2019ayr, the first Lord Helmawr, and, it is rumoured, even beyond that. Few now know of the early centuries of House Escher, the past of the clan hidden behind ritual and history. Rather, they are seen as what they have become: a matriarchy built upon a throne of chems and violence. These are the pillars of what it means to be Escher, a drive to prove their strength through skill at arms and reckless aggression, fuelled by a chemical empire that mixes Imperial science with pagan ritual. To outsiders, Eschers are cruel and deadly warriors, a perfection of the female fighter on Necromunda. Their gangs stalk the underhive alongside strange and exotic beasts, the mere touch of their weapons enough to corrupt blood or set a victim\u2019s nerves on fire. Above these youthful and energetic gang warriors toils a House more prosperous than any on Necromunda \u2013 all women born beneath the beneficent smile of a Clan Chymist equal in the eyes of the Matriarch Primus and her Council of Crones. Thus may an Escher prove herself no matter the manner or place of her birthand, should she do well in the concoction of chems, therearing of xenos beasts, or fighting for the clan in the endless inter-House wars, she may well rise up to join the council herself \u2013 or perhaps even don the mantle of Matriarch Primus.\nGANG COMPOSITION\n\nHouse Escher follows the\u00a0\nnormal rules\n\u00a0for Gang Composition.\nSPECIAL RULES\n\nFollow normal rules as other gangs with the following exceptions:\nChem-alchemy Elixir\n: A gang visiting the Trading post during the post-battle sequence can buy any number of doses (Common).\nFighters promoted to Champion can only become a Matriarch, not a Death-Maiden.\nDeath-Maidens do not have Group Activation (1).\nFIGHTERS\n\n125CREDITS\nGANG QUEEN (LEADER)\n\n\n\nSkills:\n\u00a01 Primary (custom).\nRestrictions:\n\u00a0None.\nSpecial Rules:\n\u00a0Gang Leader, Gang Hierarchy (Leader), Tools of the Trade, Group Activation (2).\nIt takes a lot of ruthlessness and no small talent for violence to be a Gang Queen. Those who rise to lead one of House Escher\u2019s underhive gangs are, without exception, skilled killers and charismatic leaders, able to inspire their girls not with empty words and promises, but bloody deeds and sheer audacity. Of course the life of a Gang Queen is seldom a long one. As any Escher will tell you: the cost of living life on the edge is that eventually you fall over it.\n100CREDITS\nGANG MATRIARCH (CHAMPION)\n\n\n\nSkills:\n\u00a01 Primary (custom).\nRestrictions:\n\u00a0None.\nSpecial Rules:\n\u00a0Gang Hierarchy (Champion), Tools of the Trade, Group Activation (1).\nGang Matriarchs are drawn from the craziest, wildest and most homicidal of the Gang Queen\u2019s girls, each one a natural killer. Favouring even more outlandish dress than most Escher, and carrying the deadliest weapons they can lay their hands on, a Matriarch is both gang enforcer, underhive assassin and debutant of death all rolled into one. It is no surprise then, that should the Gang Queen fall, it is one of the Matriarchs who will inevitably take her place as mistress of the gang.\n115CREDITS\nDEATH-MAIDEN (SPECIALIST CHAMPION)\n\n\n\nSkills:\n\u00a01 Primary (custom).\nRestrictions:\n\u00a0Pistol and Close Combat.\nSpecial Rules:\n\u00a0Gang Hierarchy (Champion), Tools of the Trade, Poison Blood.\nPOISON BLOOD\n\nToxin weapons can re-roll 1s before modifiers (against Toughness).\nThe Moraegan, or Deathmaidens, are the terror weapon of House Escher.

It is well known that they make extensive use of strange and exotic creatures to fuel their pharmaceutical production, and the fact that it provides the raw materials for their outlandish costumes appears to be a fortuitous by-product. Most of these xenos life forms come the House\u2019s way legally, through sanctioned trade with the Noble Houses of the upper spires and long-standing contracts and permits allow House Escher ready access to the segmentum\u2019s most illustrious pedigree beast breeders.\nMore disturbingly, perhaps, is the fact that House Escher runs a dark and hidden trade in the creation of new life from the creatures they deal in. Gene-spliced hybrids, flesh-fused chimerae and other, darker fusions of different species are commonly created. Provided that House Escher continues to avoid the use of intelligent xenos life in their experimentation, the Imperial House continues to turn a blind eye, and so these dumb monstrosities are produced and sold to the gladiatoria to entertain the crowds, kept as attack beasts to guard and protect Escher holdings, and quite often make their way into the ranks of particularly well renown Escher gangs, where they add considerably to the status of Leaders and Champions.\n120CREDITS\n0-2 PHYRR CAT (EXOTIC BEAST)",

At its most basic, this trade in xenos fauna helps to fuel many of theHouse\u2019s unique elixirs and forms no small part of the basis for its trade and expertisein alchemical technology. A side effect of this prodigious, and often illicit, tradeinxenos lifeforms, is that House Escher has access to the pelts and plumage of manywonderful beasts, and this is clearly evidenced in the Escher style of dress. It is alsonot uncommon for House Escher to bring onto Necromunda the creatures that featurein the fighting pits and gladiatoria, a trade, which in turn, enables the House toset up ever more contacts amongst the many big game hunters and Rogue Traders that specialise in such commodities.\nHowever, not all off-world beasts are destined for the Escher laboratoria or thefightingpits of Necromunda, some creatures are prized as companions, especially thevariousfelids that originate on many different worlds. Escher gangers are attracted to thebigcats of Phyrr in particular for their exotic looks and killer instincts. Such beasts arerare in the extreme and smuggling them planetside to Hive Primus is no meanfeat, sothey are an incredibly rare sight as pets even amongst the hierarchy of HouseEscher. Yet seen they are, and when the opportunity to acquire such a beast, or even better, amating pair, arises, Escher gang queens will go to any lengths to secure them.\n50CREDITS\n0-3 PHELYNX (EXOTIC BEAST)\n\n\n\nVENOMOUS BITE\n\nIf hitting on a 6 (before modifiers), apply Toxin.\nUNTAMED\n\nAll attacks have Reckless (only has unarmed attack).\nHouse Escher has created countless gene-smithed felinoid creatures. One of the most successful is the Phelynx, or Venom Cat. A mix of reptilian biology and Phyrr Cat genes, it is an excellent hunting beast. Phelynx are used almost exclusively by the Wyld, the Runners driving entire packs of the creatures before them into battle. As their name implies, a Venom Cat\u2019s bite can be deadly, its neuro-toxic venom able to incapacitate or kill in moments. Wyld Runners routinely apply Phelynx venom to their weapons, while some even imbibe it in small doses to build up a resistance to the toxins. Venom Cats are also naturally stealthy beasts and, like the Wyld Runners themselves, are masters of ambush. Part of this stealth comes from the creature\u2019s instinctive grace and speed, the rest from its unique biology. Unlike Phyrr Cats, Phelynx are coldblooded, their bio-signs barely registering at all, making them extremely difficultto spot with auspexes.\nThe bond between Phelynx and Wyld Runner is one built over a lifetime. When an Escher juve joins the Wyld, she will be given a weapon to master or a pet to train \u2013 this often coming in the form of an infant Phelynx. Over years of hunting and battle the Escher and beast become inseparable, one able to anticipate and coordinate with the actions of the other in a way no two human gangers could ever hope to match.\n50CREDITS\nHELION (CREW)\n\n\n\nSKILL ACCESS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMOUNT: CUTTER\n\nCost:\n\u00a085\nBecome Mounted.\nCannot be combined with any other Wargear that affects movement.\n9\" Movement.\nHigh Flight:\n\u00a0Ignores all terrain, moves freely between levels without restriction and can never fall.

The most accomplished of their kind can tap into the Psychoterica generated by their brothers and sisters, and channel it into lies so potent that they can shift a sentient being\u2019s perception of their surroundings. To deliver these lies, the Delaque must get close, often leaning in to whisper in the ear of their intended victim, but the effects can be dramatic. With a psychoteric whisper, they can make their enemies see friends as foes, think their weapons have failed them, or even become blind to the presence of the Delaque.\nPsychoteric Whispers are special short ranged psychic abilities possessed by certain Delaque. Much like skills they enhance the abilities of a fighter in specific ways and can be employed by using actions, most often with an enemy fighter as the target. Psychoteric Whispers are, in effect, psychic powers and use the rules for manifesting, disrupting and maintaining Wyrd Powers found in the Necromunda Rulebook.\nMASTERY OF LIES\n\nTo use Psychoteric Whispers, a Delaque fighter must first be upgraded to become a Psyker. Only a Master of Shadow or Phantom may be upgraded in this way \u2013 note that Psy-Gheists may also make use of these powers as they are already Psykers when added to the gang. Fighters can either be upgraded to become Psykers during gang creation, or by spending XP later on:\nA Delaque Master of Shadow or Phantom may be upgraded to become a Psyker when added to a gang roster for a cost of 30 credits (this increases their credits value accordingly). The fighter gains both the Psychoteric Mastery and Non-sanctioned Psyker special rules (as follows).\nA Delaque Master of Shadow or Phantom may be upgraded to become a Psyker by taking an advance at a cost of 7 XP (this increases their credits value by +30). The fighter gains both the Psychoteric Mastery and Non-sanctioned Psyker special rules (as follows).\nPsychoteric Mastery:\n\u00a0A fighter with this special rule is a Psyker, as described in the Necromunda Rulebook, and is able to use Psychoteric Whispers. The fighter must choose one discipline (Madness, Delusion or Darkness) to specialise in and may immediately select a single Wyrd Power from that discipline to know.\nDuring Campaign play, this fighter may gain additional Wyrd Powers from their chosen discipline in exactly the same way as they might gain a Primary Skill (i.e., by spending 6 XP to gain a random Wyrd Power, or by spending 9 XP to choose a Wyrd Power).\nNon-sanctioned Psyker:\n\u00a0Should a fighter with this special rule be taken Out of Action, the enemy gang is rewarded a bounty of D3x10 credits at the end of the battle. Should a fighter with this special rule be captured and sold to the Guilders, they are worth their full value.\nINFO\nPSYCHOTERIC CHOIRS\n\nAll Delaque share a link to the Psychoterica and, even if they are not skilled in the use of Psychoteric Whispers, can aid those that are. When a Delaque fighter (including House Agent Hired Guns, Hangers-on and Brutes) uses a Psychoteric Whisper, its potency will be increased for every friendly Delaque fighter that is within 3\" of them, is Standing and is not Engaged, as the other Delaque join in with hissing whispers under their breath. Each eligible Delaque fighter within this range will increase the range of the Psychoteric Whisper by 1\" (to a maximum of +3\").\nIn addition, the Psychoteric Whisper will be harder to resist, and any Intelligence check made to resist the Psychoteric Whisper must reduce the result of the dice roll by 1 for each friendly Delaque fighter within 3\" of the whisperer (to a maximum of 3).\nMADNESS\n\nThe psychoteric discipline of Madness is the psychic mastery of fear and insanity, and those skilled in its use can make those who hear their whispers lose all rational thought. At its most simple, it instils panic and indecisiveness in those it touches, but a skilled psyker can expand it even further, until the world breaks down around their victims, leaving only a realm of darkness and terror from which there can be no escape.\n1.

Sometimes, this is whatever is lying around the underhive battlefield, such as barrels for cover or boltholes from which to launch ambushes. Other times they bring the terrain with them, setting up fixed weapon platforms, defensive barricades or piles of ammo crates within easy reach of their fighters.\nDelaque gangs can call upon a number of specialist terrain features to include in their battles. These pieces of terrain are bought from the Trading Post during the post-battle sequence. Once bought, they are added to the gang\u2019s stash, and can be fielded in any game the gang plays unless noted otherwise.\nPLACING GANG TERRAIN\n\nGang terrain is placed on the battlefield before any fighters are deployed. A gang can place its terrain in its own deployment area, or, if noted, in no-man\u2019s land (i.e., anywhere outside their opponent\u2019s deployment zone and their own deployment zone). Some pieces of terrain (as noted in their descriptions) can only be used if the gang is the defender in a scenario with an attacker and a defender.\nDELAQUE TERRAIN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nINFO\nHIDDEN TRAPS\n\nSome traps are cunningly hidden among the gloom and debris of the underhive, fighters not knowing if a pile of rubble is just more rubbish or a deadly surprise. If a trap uses the Hidden Traps rule then it is represented on the battlefield by not one but six markers. These markers can be tokens, or appropriate terrain elements on 25mm bases. When preparing these markers, one out of the six is the real trap (mark its underside, or secretly make a note to determine which one is real), the others are false traps. When a fighter triggers a trap, as detailed in the trap\u2019s description, it is revealed. False traps are discarded while the real trap remains on the battlefield. Note that even when the real trap is revealed, other false traps remain on the battlefield until they have been interacted with \u2013 this is important if more than one trap is in play, as it will keep the enemy guessing as to just how many traps remain to be discovered.\nWHISPERBOX\n\nDelaque gangs are often accompanied into battle by faint whispers and barely heard curses that unnerve their foes. There is nothing supernatural about this, however. It is caused by the Delaque sneaking onto the battlefield beforehand and hiding small voxcasters known as whisperboxes.\nA Whisperbox can be placed anywhere on the battlefield that is not within the enemy\u2019s deployment zone. While in play, all enemy fighters within 8\" of the Whisperbox must apply a -1 modifier to the dice roll when making Cool checks. Though they are represented by a token or base, Whisperboxes are difficult to find and destroy. An enemy fighter in base contact with a Whisperbox may try to destroy it as a Basic action by making an Intelligence check with a -3 penalty to the dice roll. If the check is passed, the Whisperbox is destroyed.\nA Whisperbox can be represented by a 25mm marker or a piece of terrain modelled on a 25mm Necromunda base.\nSIGHTBLIND TRAP\n\nHouse Delaque use a variety of traps to ensnare or disable their foes, such as sightblind traps that let off intensive bursts of light and sound to confuse and disorientate enemies. A Sightblind Trap is a Hidden Trap and has the following weapon profile:",
        "a1c9df3d-a4b4-4957-aa08-a052ad542ba8": "When an enemy fighter moves within 2\" of a Sightblind Trap marker, they must immediately stop and the marker is flipped over. If the marker reveals a false trap, it is removed from play. If the marker reveals the real trap, it explodes immediately with the above profile. Note that when a Sightblind Trap explodes, every fighter that is touched by the Blast marker is hit.\nSHADOW VEIL\n\nShadow veils are devices used by the Delaque to lower the surrounding light levels in an area. By absorbing photo-radiation, the small object, akin to an antenna or vox dish, causes gloom to gather around it, while the device itself is shrouded in blackness.\nA Shadow Veil can be placed anywhere on the battlefield that is not within the enemy\u2019s deployment zone. While in play, the area within 3\" of the Shadow Veil is subject to the Pitch Black rules (as detailed in the Necromunda Rulebook). Note, this area also effectively blocks line of sight from one side to the other. The Shadow Veil itself can be attacked as if it were a fighter (though note, it is still in the middle of an area of Pitch Black), it has a Toughness of 4 and 1 Wound. If reduced to 0 Wounds, remove it from play (though not from the owning gang\u2019s roster) and end its effects.\nA Shadow Veil can be represented by a 25mm marker or a piece of terrain modelled on a 25mm Necromunda base.\nWEB TRAP\n\nHouse Delaque use a variety of traps to ensnare or disable their foes, these include Web Traps, designed to unleash a shower of binding webs \u2013 perfect for capturing prey that wander into their domains. A Web Trap is a Hidden Trap and has the following weapon profile:\n\n\nWhen an enemy fighter moves within 2\" of a Web Trap marker, they must immediately stop and make an Initiative check. If this check is passed, they can continue their movement as normal. If it is failed, flip over the marker to see if it is the real trap as per the Hidden Traps rule. If it is a false trap, discard the marker. If the marker reveals the real trap, it explodes immediately with the above profile. Note that, when a Web Trap explodes, every fighter that is touched by the Blast marker is hit.\nPSYCHOTERIC ARTEFACT (GANG RELIC)\n\nA Psychoteric artefact is a strange sculpture that has particular significance to the Delaque. Perhaps it represents some hero of the clan, rendered in the abstract, or maybe there are secrets hidden in its odd angles and impossible shapes. Some believe these objects represent the strange alien gods the Delaque worship, though their true purpose remains known only to the Delaque themselves.\nA Psychoteric artefact counts as a Gang Relic (as described in the Necromunda Rulebook). In addition, Delaque fighters that linger close by a Psychoteric artefact seem to blend into the shifting shapes of the object and are painful to look at. All friendly Delaque fighters within 6\" of the Psychoteric artefact count as being in full cover.\nDelaque gangs can only include a Psychoteric artefact if they are the defender in a scenario with an attacker and defender.\nA Psychoteric artefact can be represented by a 40mm marker or a piece of terrain modelled on a 40mm Necromunda base.\nLast updated\u00a0on",

Unlike the Goliath, Escher, Van Saar and Orlock Houses, that are built upon vital industries and lord their wealth and power over a substantial population of workers, or the Cawdor, who are bound together by faith and claim populations across the hive world as their own, the Delaque have no defined home and no defined industrial role within Necromundan society. If one were to ask a hiver what purpose the Delaque serve for Lord Helmawr, one would doubtless receive myriad answers. Some believe them to be information brokers, who deal in secrets and buy and sell this vital commodity to the highest bidder. Others claim they are afforded their place because of some clandestine deal with the Helmawr line, and that they are spies for the Imperial House, or perhaps one or more of the Noble Houses. Still others claim the Delaque are assassins and saboteurs without peer, and in a world where open warfare between Houses is forbidden, all must enlist their services if they want to advance their power and influence. Like all good lies there is a grain of truth in each of these beliefs. For instance it is true that the Delaque deal in information, and any hiver knows that if you can meet their price a Delaque info-broker can find out what you want to know. It is also true that there is some connection between Lord Helmawr and Delaque, though no one really knows the true nature of this relationship and it ranges from them being the Lord of Necromunda\u2019s eyes and ears below the Wall to the Delaque being a bastard offshoot of the Imperial House itself. House Delaque is also known for the quality of its spies, assassins and saboteurs, though they do not market themselves like mercenaries, and these skills seem more to be a by-product of their true purpose\u2026 whatever that is.\nGANG COMPOSITION\n\nHouse Delaque follows the\u00a0\nnormal rules\n\u00a0for Gang Composition.\nSPECIAL RULES\n\nFollow normal rules as other gangs with the following exceptions:\nPsychoteric Whispers\n\u00a0and\u00a0\nPsychoteric Mastery\nFIGHTERS\n\n100CREDITS\nMASTER OF SHADOW (LEADER)\n\n\n\nSkills:\n\u00a01 Primary (custom).\nRestrictions:\n\u00a0None.\nSpecial Rules:\n\u00a0Gang Leader, Gang Hierarchy (Leader), Tools of the Trade, Group Activation (2), Psychoteric Whispers.\nPSYCHOTERIC WHISPERS\n\nUpgrade for +30 credits when recruited to become an Unsanctioned Psyker and Psychoteric Mastery.

Most other clans see little distinction between the Delaque Spektor forms and consider them merely another mechanical ally created by the House of Shadow. In truth, the Piscean Spektors are unlike anything else employed by the Delaque and are more akin to a true race in their own right. A cybernetic form wrapped around a harvested xenos brain, the Spektor retains much of its memories from its prior existence, and serves the Clan House in accordance with an ancient pact between humans and its race. While not even the Delaque know for sure where the Pisceans come from, it is believed they are an aquatic race that arrived on Necromunda millennia ago and made their home in its subterranean seas. Occasionally, ancient members of this race come to the Delaque to have their brains placed in machines, the two races sharing a common connection to the Psychoterica.",
        "ea70a836-539e-4668-bf02-80c215b84265": "CAWDOR TERRAIN\nSource: House of Faith\nGangs often make use of terrain in their battles against their rivals. Sometimes this is whatever is lying around the underhive battlefield, such as barrels for cover or boltholes from which to launch ambushes. Other times they bring the terrain with them, setting up fixed weapon platforms, defensive barricades or piles of ammo crates within easy reach of their fighters.\nCawdor gangs can call upon a number of specialist terrain features to include in their gang. These pieces of terrain are bought from the Trading Post during the post-battle sequence. Once bought, they are added to the gang\u2019s stash, and can be fielded in any game the gang plays unless noted otherwise.\nPLACING GANG TERRAIN\n\nGang terrain is placed on the battlefield before any fighters are deployed. A gang can place its terrain in its own deployment area, or, if noted, in no-man\u2019s-land (i.e., anywhere outside their opponent\u2019s deployment zone and their own deployment zone). Some pieces of terrain (as noted in their descriptions) can only be used if the gang is the defender in a scenario with an attacker and a defender.\nCAWDOR TERRAIN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nINFO\nHIDDEN TRAPS\n\nSome traps are cunningly hidden among the gloom and debris of the underhive, fighters not knowing if a pile of rubble is just more rubbish or a deadly surprise. If a trap uses the Hidden Traps rule then it is represented on the battlefield by not one but six markers. These markers can be tokens, or appropriate terrain elements on 25mm bases. When preparing these markers, one out of the six is the real trap (mark its underside, or secretly make a note to determine which one is real), the others are false traps. When a fighter triggers a trap, as detailed in the trap\u2019s description, it is revealed. False traps are discarded while the real trap remains on the battlefield. Note that even when the real trap is revealed, other false traps remain on the battlefield until they have been interacted with \u2013 this is important if more than one trap is in play, as it will keep the enemy guessing as to just how many traps remain to be discovered.\nDIVINE BRAZIER\n\nThe gangs of House Cawdor often daub symbols of the faith on the walls of the underhive, or bring along icons hammered together from hive scrap to inspire them \u2013 these icons are more often than not on fire. A Divine Brazier can be placed anywhere in the Cawdor gang\u2019s deployment zone. If the Pitch Black rules are being used then all fighters within 3\" of the Divine Brazier count as revealed. As a simple action, any fighter may dip a weapon with the Melee or Versatile trait in the brazier, giving the weapon the Blaze trait until the End phase of the following round.\nA Divine Brazier should be represented by a 32mm marker or a piece of terrain modelled on a 32mm Necromunda base.\nINCENDIARY TRAP\n\nThe gangs of House Cawdor often make crude incendiary traps that can douse an entire area in flame. An Incendiary Trap is a Hidden trap (as described previously) and has the following profile:",
        "e26c4715-2d31-4967-9370-6dd92f865ea1": "HIVE INCENSE\n\nAs part of their religious rites, House Cawdor gangs often burn holy censers or tapers of incense \u2013 perhaps having seen such rituals being performed by the priests of the Ministorum. Unlike that august organisation, however, the incense burned by the Redemption is often far from \u2018holy\u2019. Hive Incense may be placed anywhere on the battlefield that is not within the enemy gang\u2019s deployment zone and not within 6\" of an enemy fighter. Any ranged attack that is made into, out of or across the area within 3\" of the Hive Incense suffers a -1 modifier to the Hit roll.\nIn addition, all fighters \u2013 with the exception of House Cawdor fighters \u2013 that start their activation within 3\" of a Hive Incense marker must make a Toughness check as if they had been hit by a weapon with the Gas trait (allowing them to use the modifier granted by filter plugs or a respirator, for example). If this check is failed, their first Move (simple) action must be made in a random direction, as determined by the Scatter dice.\nHive Incense is represented by a 32mm marker or a piece of terrain modelled on a 32mm Necromunda base.\nCAGED HERETIC\n\nAs a warning to the faithless, House Cawdor gangs will sometimes bring along heretics, mutants or other unclean prisoners to display to their enemies. Transported in swaying gibbets, the prisoners are hung over the battlefield, where their piteous cries act as a reminder to the unworthy as to the price of opposing the Redemption. A Caged Heretic may be placed anywhere on the battlefield that is not within the enemy gang\u2019s deployment zone and not within 6\" of an enemy fighter. All fighters \u2013 with the exception of House Cawdor fighters \u2013 that end their movement within 6\" of a Caged Heretic must make a Nerve test.\nCaged Heretics cannot be targeted by shooting (it is assumed they cower in their cages if shot at), though if they are caught under a Blast marker or template roll a D6 \u2013 on a 3+ they are unaffected, otherwise they are destroyed and removed from the battlefield. Enemy fighters may also attempt to free the Caged Heretic by performing a Double action while in base contact with the Caged Heretic and making a Strength or Intelligence check. If the check is passed, remove the Caged Heretic from the battlefield and the fighter that freed them gains D3 XP.\nA Caged Heretic is represented by a 32mm marker or a piece of terrain modelled on a 32mm Necromunda base.\nHOLY GANG-RELIC\n\nHoly Gang-Relics are sacred objects that hold great significance to the Redemption. It might be a battered autopistol (now long broken) that was once wielded by a great \u2018saint\u2019 of the clan, or perhaps a shattered fragment of armour that in a certain light looks like the face of the God-Emperor (or at least how the followers of the Redemption believe his face to look). A Holy Gang-Relic counts as a Gang Relic (see the Necromunda Rulebook). In addition, Cawdor fighters within 6\" of a Holy Gang- Relic are filled with a fervent zeal as they attempt to protect the object, and may apply a +1 modifier to both their Hit and Wound rolls.\nCawdor gangs can only include a Holy Gang-Relic if they are the defender in a scenario with an attacker and defender.\nA Holy Gang-Relic can be represented by a 40mm marker or a piece of terrain modelled on a 40mm Necromunda base.\nIf an enemy fighter is able to get within 1\" of a Holy Gang-Relic, they can make a Defile Relic (Double) action. Once a Holy Gang-Relic has been defiled, it loses its special rules and cannot be defiled again. In a campaign, a fighter who defiles a Holy Gang-Relic gains D3 XP.\nLast updated\u00a0on",
        "bcadd229-16b5-4ebc-8a55-d9862720dd3b": "ARTICLES OF FAITH\nSource: House of Faith\nThere is no greater weapon in the arsenal of the Imperium than faith. This is a fact as true among the greater diaspora of humanity as it is on Necromunda, and in the depths of the hive cities there are none more faithful than the followers of the Redemption. Tales abound of members of Clan Cawdor overcoming terrible wounds, delivering devastating blows or even cheating death itself through the strength of their belief. While undoubtedly many of these tales are either exaggerated or outright fabrications, enough evidence exists to make those who have faced the warriors of the Redemption wonder just what it might have been that turned aside their bullet or lent strength to the attacks of their foes \u2013 was it just luck, or was something divine at work?\nArticles of Faith are a collection of rules that apply to all House Cawdor fighters. As they focus on the faith and conviction of the followers of the Redemption they are not so clean cut as things like Skills, Wargear or bionics that grant their users clearly defined benefits at an XP or credit cost. Rather, should a Cawdor fighter believe strongly enough in themselves, their brothers and the God-Emperor, something miraculous might happen. Equally though, should the fighter\u2019s faith falter, then the gifts of the God-Emperor that were so graciously bestowed upon them might just as easily be taken away.\nFAITH DICE\n\nFaith dice represent the religious zeal of a Cawdor gang. These dice are a resource that all Cawdor gangs (except those that have become Chaos Corrupted or Genestealer Infected) generate over the course of a battle, and which can be used to attempt miraculous events known as \u2018Articles of Faith\u2019 \u2013 such as surviving a fatal blow or making an impossible leap.\nGENERATING FAITH DICE\n\nFaith is a strange thing \u2013 and those that attempt to understand how it works probably don\u2019t have it. Sometimes a tide of righteous frenzy will envelop the fighters of House Cawdor, bearing them to victory on a tide of religious zeal. Other times the gaze of the God-Emperor will turn away from them, leaving them to their fate.\nIn the End phase of each round (including the first), count up the number of friendly House Cawdor fighters currently on the battlefield that are neither Seriously Injured or Broken, and roll a D6 for each. Each dice that rolls a 5 or 6 is added to a special pool of dice called the Faith dice pool (this can also be represented by tokens or notes on a piece of paper if it is easier).\nCawdor fighters may also attempt to work themselves up into a frenzy of faith \u2013 waving holy relics, chanting prayers or flagellating themselves \u2013 during their activation by performing the Beseech the God-Emperor (Double) action:\nBeseech the God-Emperor (Double):\n\u00a0During the End phase, roll three D6 for a fighter that performed this action, rather than the usual one.\nFaith dice can be retained from one round to the next. However, if in the End phase, after generating Faith dice, there are more dice in the pool than there are friendly House Cawdor fighters on the battlefield, these excess dice must be discarded.\nUSING FAITH DICE\n\nWhen a Cawdor fighter activates, if there is at least one dice in the Faith dice pool, they may attempt to invoke an Article of Faith. Each Article of Faith only affects the fighter performing it (unless otherwise noted) and lasts until the start of that fighter\u2019s next activation (unless otherwise noted). An Article of Faith must be invoked and performed at the start of a fighter\u2019s activation, before performing any actions. Attempting an Article of Faith does not require the fighter to use one of their actions (unless otherwise noted).\nWhen invoking an Article of Faith, the controlling player declares the Article of Faith the fighter is attempting to invoke. The fighter then makes a Threshold test. To make a Threshold test, the player chooses a number of Faith dice to roll, removing them from the Faith dice pool and rolling them. Once this roll has been made, the number of dice used cannot be changed, i.e., the player cannot roll more Faith dice to increase the total rolled. Once a dice has been taken from the Faith dice pool, it is used up and discarded:\nIf the total result equals or exceeds the threshold of the Article of Faith being invoked, a miracle has occurred and the Article of Faith is performed successfully!\nIf the total result is lower than the threshold of the Article of Faith being invoked, they have failed and the God-Emperor has turned his back on them.",
        "75f85d9a-b4b5-4193-87fd-14a3777aae0f": "Attempting an Article of Faith does not require the fighter to use one of their actions (unless otherwise noted).\nWhen invoking an Article of Faith, the controlling player declares the Article of Faith the fighter is attempting to invoke.

Most Redemptionist faiths stay more or less true to the core tenets of the Clan House, those rules that reflect tried and true beliefs. Some stray, or include divergent philosophies.\nThese divergent beliefs are represented in games of Necromunda by the four \u2018Paths of Faith\u2019. These are the Path of the Faithful, the Path of the Fanatic, the Path of the Doomed, and the Path of the Redeemer.\nThe Path of Faith a House Cawdor gang follows is determined by their Leader and must be chosen when the gang is first created. Once a Path has been chosen the Leader may not choose another or change it. However, should the Leader die, their successor may choose their own Path \u2013 affecting the rest of the gang as normal.\nEach Path grants the gang access to a different set of Articles of Faith, reflecting the ideologies of the gang members. There are also certain benefits conferred by the path a gang follows.\nPATH OF THE FAITHFUL\n\nThe Path of the Faithful is the path followed by the great majority of House Cawdor. It is the path of the Redemption, an extreme interpretation of the Imperial Creed that fills many with dread and fear. Whilst most members of House Cawdor consider themselves moderate, to outsiders there is little distinction between a moderate Redemptionist and an outlawed follower of a fanatical fringe. If a Leader has chosen this Path, their gang gains the following benefits:\nWhen generating Faith dice, an additional D6 is rolled for each friendly House Cawdor Leader or Champion that is currently on the battlefield and that is not either Seriously Injured or Broken.\nThe following Articles of Faith can only be performed by members of a House Cawdor gang that follows the Path of the Faithful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPATH OF THE FANATIC\n\nThose who follow the Path of the Fanatic embody the frenzy of faith the Redemption is so well known for. The Red Walk, Disciples of the Burning Brand and the Children of Blessed Day are all examples of splinter faiths of the Redemption who follow the Path of the Fanatic.

Doing so allows a gang leader to choose up to four Articles of Faith which will form the basis for their gang\u2019s unique beliefs. However, selecting this option does enable players to choose a combination of Articles of Faith that may prove very powerful when used in battle. It is therefore essential that, should a player wish to forge their own Path, the Arbitrator first grants permission.\nShould a gang leader wish to forge their own Path, follow these steps:\nName your Path:\n\u00a0Before forging their own Path, the player must first name the Path. Doing so is an essential step that will help define the beliefs of the gang. Without this first step, players may simply be choosing what they feel is the best combination of Articles of Faith to use, and that should be avoided!\nChoose your Beliefs:\n\u00a0Choose up to four different Articles of Faith from those listed previously. These will form the basis of the gang\u2019s unique Path of Faith. This could be one Article of Faith from each Path, or any other combination the player wishes.\nFinally, players should note that when forging their own Path, their gang will not gain any of the benefits associated with any of the Paths of Faith.\nPATH OF THE PROPHET\n\nDESIGNER\u2019S COMMENTARY: PATHS OF FAITH\nPresented below are the rules for the Path of the Prophet, a new path for the Cawdor Articles of Faith rules (as detailed above). These rules allow players to recreate the action detailed in Nexus of Violence and, if the Arbitrator wishes, these new rules may be included in their campaign.\nSource: Apocrypha Necromunda: Nexus of Violence\nThe Path of the Prophet is the utter devotion to the word of the Prophet and the Great Pilgrimage which he leads. Its followers see this path as the one true expression of the Redemption, and the Prophet himself as ordained by the God-Emperor to lead all who claim devotion to the Imperial Creed. During the Aranthian Succession millions of faithful would flock to the banner of the Prophet, until they dominated the fractured House of Cawdor in their relentless quest to convert or destroy all who opposed their holy master.\nWhen generating Faith dice, if your crew outnumbers your opponent\u2019s crew (only counting fighters currently on the battlefield that are not Seriously Injured or Broken), roll an additional number of D6s equal to the number of fighters your crew outnumbers your opponent\u2019s crew by.\nThe following Articles of Faith can only be performed by members of a House Cawdor gang that follows the Path of the Prophet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast updated\u00a0on",

Nothing yet created by the Noble Houses compares to the damage faith has done to their people, and nothing in the entire hive world unites its inhabitants so surely. Even the fear of Lord Helmawr and the Imperial House cannot compete with true faith, and it is in this that House Cawdor\u2019s power lies. All the other Clan Houses and Noble Houses are built upon alliances, the exchange of wealth, and obligation; their roots tied inexplicably to the industry of the hive world. Though House Cawdor shares in this industry, it is not defined by it. Rather, where most count credits each cycle to measure the worth of their subjects, the people of Clan Cawdor consider themselves strong so long as their faith remains strong. This has saved Cawdor from extinction where so many other Clan Houses have succumbed to the march of time or the ebb and flow of production quotas. For even while Cawdor languishes beneath its peers in terms of wealth and military might, it has never been poor in its beliefs.\nFrom the outside, other Necromundans see House Cawdor as bonepickers, scavengers and beggars, little better than the hive rats that plague their holesteads. Only the mantle of being born of a Clan House elevates them above the clanless masses or the serf class, though most self-respecting subjects of Lord Helmawr will not deal with them. However, they do perform a vital role within hive society, picking through the refuse and cast-offs of the factoria, so that nothing might go to waste. If this were the only thing they were known for, Clan Cawdor might be better accepted by their peers. As it is, few can think of the Clan House without thinking of the faith that drives them. And they are not mistaken in this belief, for on Necromunda, Clan Cawdor and the Redemptionist faith are one and the same.\nGANG COMPOSITION\n\nHouse Cawdor follows the\u00a0\nnormal rules\n\u00a0for Gang Composition.\nSPECIAL RULES\n\nFollow normal rules as other gangs with the following exceptions:\nArticles of Faith\nDevout Masses\n,\nRedemptionist Juve (Zealot):\n\tCounts as a Juve (Specialist) for the purpose of not triggering Nerve tests to other friendly fighters when Seriously Injured or taken Out of Action.

Their existing characteristics do not change, but they will lose the Promotion (Cawdor Firebrand or Redemptionist Deacon), Born in the Saddle, Hot-headed, Fast Learner and Pious special rules and gain all the special rules associated with a Cawdor Firebrand or a Redemptionist Deacon, as appropriate.\nNote that when a fighter is promoted in this way (especially when promoted to become a Redemptionist Deacon), an appropriate model should be used to represent their new category and type.\nBORN IN THE SADDLE\n\nThis fighter is more comfortable on their mount than onfoot and would never be without it.

Their flesh is diseased and their plumage is scarce. The remaining sheen birds are foul things, infested with parasites and filthy with pollution. Even their rudimentary programming has corrupted, causing them to act as sinister parodies of real birds.\nOccasionally, sheen birds will make their way into the lower levels of the underhive. Here they are greeted with awe by the devoted of House Cawdor, who view them as avatars of the Emperor\u2019s grace.

Some of these individuals are even able to tap into this immaterial realm and channel its power, manifesting psychic abilities that defy the laws of nature and Mankind. While the Imperium severely sanctions anyone with these abilities, or anyone in league with them, it does not stop psykers from propagating throughout Necromunda. Known among the underhive as wyrds, those with psychic gifts are much sought after by gangs, Guilds and criminals alike to provide an edge in the endless wars between the Clan Houses. Some wyrds even band together to form their own gangs, becoming the scourge of the underhive \u2013 at least until they are hunted down and exterminated!\nThis section, designed to work alongside the rules for psykers presented in the Necromunda Rulebook, greatly expands upon the Wyrd Powers available to players and Arbitrators in their games. Presented here are seven Wyrd Power disciplines that can be used by psykers: Biomancy, Chronomancy, Divination, Pyromancy, Technomancy, Telepathy and Telekinesis.\nUSING WYRD POWER DISCIPLINES\n\nAny fighter with the Sanctioned Psyker special rule or Non-sanctioned Psyker special rule can make use of the disciplines presented here using the guidelines below. Unless allowed by the Arbitrator, Dramatis Personae cannot use these discipline powers, and must instead use the powers presented with their profiles (as they are unique individuals often with unique powers).\nUnless otherwise specified, all fighters with the Sanctioned Psyker or Non-sanctioned Psyker special rule start with a single Wyrd Power, either chosen from those included in their gang list or from one of the disciplines presented here.\nBounty Hunters\n\u00a0and\u00a0\nVenator Hunt Leaders\n\u00a0can be upgraded when hired to have the Sanctioned Psyker or Nonsanctioned Psyker special rule (as chosen by the player) for +35 credits.\nA Sanctioned Psyker or Non-sanctioned Psyker may choose any Wyrd Power from those presented here (instead of one from their gang list) as an Advancement, just as they would gain a Primary skill as an Advancement (either by generating a power randomly for 9 XP, or choosing one for 12 XP).\nThere is no limit to the number of Wyrd Powers a fighter may know.\nIf all of a fighter\u2018s Wyrd Powers are chosen from a single Wyrd Power discipline, they will automatically gain that discipline\u2019s special ability. Note, however, that should the fighter ever gain a power from a different discipline, this ability is immediately lost.\nFinally, when a fighter takes a dose of Ghast, they may generate their Wyrd Power from those presented here; this must still be a random Wyrd Power, though you may choose which discipline the power is from.\nINFO\nFORCE WEAPONS\n\nSome rare melee weapons, commonly known as force weapons in the vernacular of the underhive, are specially attuned to those with wyrd powers and can be devastating killing tools in their hands. Such weapons are usually created by taking high-quality versions of mundane close combat weapons, which are then inlaid with psi-amplifiers that channel the power of the Warp, allowing the wielder to deliver killing blows accentuated by their own wyrd powers.\nAny weapon with the Melee trait can be upgraded into a Force Weapon by buying a Psi-amplifier from the Trading Post and performing the Psi Attune post-battle action (see page 127).\nIn the hands of a non-psyker, a Force Weapon has no additional effects. However, when wielded by a fighter with either the Sanctioned Psyker or Non-sanctioned Psyker special rule, the weapon gains both the Power and Sever traits.\nBIOMANCY DISCIPLINE\n\nBiomancy is the psychic mastery of flesh and bone; those gifted in its practise are able to knit flesh together, turn their skin to iron or inflict crippling pain upon their enemies. Such individuals are known as biomancers and are often skilled fighters who use their gifts to shrug off wounds while enhancing their speed, strength and endurance to overcome their foes.\nBIOMANCER SPECIAL ABILITY\n\nIf a Wyrd only selects powers from the Biomancy discipline, they gain the Fast Healing special rule:\nFast Healing:\n\u00a0When this fighter makes a Recovery test, roll an extra Injury dice then choose one to discard.\n1.

That fighter must roll an Injury dice and immediately apply the effects.\n4. STOP BLEEDING (BASIC)\n\nFocusing their power on a wounded ally, the wyrd closes up their wounds.\nChoose a friendly fighter that has suffered at least one Flesh Wound and that is within 18\" and line of sight of this fighter. That fighter immediately removes any Flesh Wounds they currently have.\n5. QUICKENING (BASIC), CONTINUOUS EFFECT\n\nThe wyrd pours psychic energy into their muscles, greatly increasing their reflexes.\nWhile this Wyrd Power is maintained, improve this fighter\u2019s Movement characteristic by 3 and their Weapon Skill, Ballistic Skill and Initiative characteristics by 1 (to a maximum of 2+).\n6. IRON ARM (BASIC), CONTINUOUS EFFECT\n\nWith a thought, the wyrd turns the flesh of their arm to unyielding iron, allowing them to block any blow directed at them.\nWhile this Wyrd Power is maintained, the fighter gains a special 5+ save against attacks made against them in close combat. This save may be made after any save rolls for armour, and is not modified by AP.\nCHRONOMANCY DISCIPLINE\n\nAmong the strangest of all wyrds are those who can manipulate the very flow of time itself. Some would say that the chronomancer, as such psykers are known, do not actually alter time, but rather people\u2019s perception of it, allowing them to seem to move as a blur, pass in and out of existence seemingly at will, or even freeze a moment in time to take perfect aim before allowing events to continue.\nCHRONOMANCER SPECIAL ABILITY\n\nIf a wyrd only selects powers from the Chronomancy discipline, they gain the Flicker special rule:\nFlicker:\n\u00a0Once per battle, this fighter may perform one additional action during their activation.\n1. FREEZE TIME (DOUBLE)\n\nReality seems to thicken all around the fighter, and events slow down to a crawl \u2013 has time truly stopped, or are those caught in the power merely experiencing its flow differently?\nAll fighters, friend and foe, within 12\" of this fighter may only perform a single action when activated for the remainder of this round.\n2.

This fighter chooses one of the target\u2019s Wyrd Powers \u2013 that power may not be used this round.\n3.

Diviners, as wyrds talented in this discipline are known, are in high demand among the gangs and organisations of the underhive; for who wouldn\u2019t want to be able to look into the future and anticipate the actions of their enemies before they even happen?\nDIVINER SPECIAL ABILITY\n\nIf a wyrd only selects powers from the Divination discipline, they gain the Future Sight special rule:\nFuture Sight:\n\u00a0Once per battle, this fighter may use this ability to re-roll any dice roll made during their activation. This ability may be used to re-roll any number of dice and may even be used on a roll made by an enemy fighter.\n1. PRECOGNITION (SPECIAL)\n\nThe wyrd peers into the future to see what fate has in store for them.\nIf this fighter is part of a gang during the Determine Scenario step of the pre-battle sequence, their gang may choose the scenario rather than rolling randomly. If the scenario has an attacker and a defender, the gang this fighter belongs to is automatically the attacker. If both gangs have a wyrd with this power, they have no effect as they cancel each other out.\n2. FOREBODING (DOUBLE), CONTINUOUS EFFECT\n\nGlimpsing moments in the near future, this wyrd predicts the movements of their enemies and guns them down.\nWhile this Wyrd Power is maintained, the fighter may either gain the\u00a0\nOverwatch\n\u00a0skill or grant the Overwatch skill to a single friendly fighter that is both within 12\" and line of sight of this fighter.\n3. MISFORTUNE (BASIC)\n\nPicking the perfect moment to act, the wyrd exploits their enemy\u2019s slightest misfortune.\nAt any point prior to the End phase of this round, this fighter may force one enemy fighter that is currently both within 12\" and line of sight of this fighter to re-roll a single dice roll.\n4. FOREWARNING (BASIC)\n\nA feeling overcomes the wyrd, warning them of the slightest danger to their life.\nUntil the End phase of this round, the first time this fighter is hit by an attack roll a D6. On a 2+, the hit is ignored.\n5. WARP WHISPERS (SPECIAL)\n\nConversing with denizens of the Warp, the wyrd learns how best to exploit their current situation.\nWhile this fighter is part of a gang, that gang may increase their Crew size by 1 for the scenario, and may re-roll any rolls for Reinforcements.",

Since Mankind first ventured out into the void, the number of psykers being born has steadily grown, though at a terrible cost to the genetic stock of Mankind. For each one that comes into the world, millions of mutants are also born, as if nature itself were toying with biology in an effort to force Mankind to evolve. As the 41st Millennium draws to a close, psykers and mutants fill every corner of the galaxy, moving amongst humanity unnoticed or lurking in the shadows of cities and hives.\nPSYCHIC POWERS\n\nPsykers are a distinct type of fighter who are able to manifest strange and powerful abilities, bringing death, destruction and worse to the gang wars of the underhive. During a battle, psykers are activated just like any other fighter, with the exception that they may perform \u2018Wyrd Power (X)\u2019 actions, which enable them to manifest their abilities.\nA Wyrd Power (X) action may be (Simple), (Basic) or (Double), depending upon the complexity of the Wyrd Power the psyker is attempting to manifest. This will always be shown in brackets after the name of the Wyrd Power itself. When a psyker is activated, they may choose to perform one or more Wyrd Power (X) actions.\nWyrd Powers are named by discipline first, such as Telekinesis \u2013 the power to manipulate and move objects, and as a unique effect second, such as Force Blast \u2013 the power to push enemies back with a thought. Most psykers follow one discipline closely, though it is not uncommon for a psyker to possess abilities drawn from two or more different disciplines. Regardless of the Wyrd Power(s) that a psyker knows, all psykers are able to perform the following actions:\nMaintain Control (Simple):\n\u00a0In order to maintain a Continuous Effect (as follows), the psyker must perform this action. If they do not, the Continuous Effect expires at the end of this fighter\u2019s activation. The psyker immediately makes a Willpower test with a +3 modifier \u2013 if the test is passed then the power remains in effect until their next activation; if failed, the power ends immediately.\nIf they wish, the psyker may instead choose to make this action for free at the start of their activation \u2013 if they do so then they do not add any bonuses to their Willpower test and may not attempt to manifest another Wyrd Power this activation regardless of whether or not the Willpower test is successful.\nConcentrate (Basic):\n\u00a0If the fighter makes a Willpower test in their subsequent action, add 1 to the result of the dice roll.\nUSING WYRD POWERS\n\nWhen a psyker makes a Wyrd Power (X) action, they must make a Willpower test to see if the action is successful. If the test is passed, the Wyrd Power takes immediate effect. If it is failed, the Wyrd Power has no effect and the action is wasted.\nSome Wyrd Power (X) actions are noted as being a Continuous Effect. Such a power lasts from when the psyker performs the action until the end of their next activation when it will expire, unless they perform a Maintain Control (Simple) action during their activation, in which case the Continuous Effect remains in play for another round. A psyker can only ever have one Continuous Effect in play. If a psyker is Prone and Seriously Injured or taken Out of Action, any of their Continuous Effects will immediately expire.\nHowever, using Wyrd Powers is not without risk. If the Willpower test is failed on the roll of a double 1, the psyker must immediately roll on the\u00a0\nPerils of the Warp table\n. If the Willpower test is passed on the roll of a double 6, the Wyrd Power takes effect, cannot be Disrupted (see\u00a0\nPsychic Duels\n) and the psyker must immediately roll on the Perils of the Warp table.\nPSYCHIC DUELS\n\nWhenever a psyker is activated to make a Wyrd Power (X) action or to make a Maintain Control (Simple) action, if there is a Standing and Active or Prone and Pinned enemy psyker within 18\", they may attempt to Disrupt the psyker\u2019s successful Wyrd Power.\nTo Disrupt a successful Wyrd Power (X) action, a psyker must roll 2D6.",

If the total is equal to or lower than the total of the Willpower test made to successfully perform the action, the Disruption attempt fails and the Wyrd Power (X) action is resolved.\nHowever, Disruption attempts can be just as risky as manifesting psychic powers. If a double 6 is rolled, the Wyrd Power is cancelled, but the psyker making the Disruption attempt must immediately roll on the Perils of the Warp table.

Bearing the official approval of Imperial authorities, sanctioned psykers wield their powers under the control and vigilance of overseers and handlers. Trained from an early age in the correct use of their abilities and to minimise the risks of daemonic possession, sanctioned psykers are free to operate as they wish without the risk of censure by the authorities. A non-sanctioned psyker, by contrast, exists outside of the system and in secret, unaware of the great risks they present to themselves and others, and oblivious to the great efforts the Imperium goes to in controlling their kind. The rewards for bringing a non-sanctioned psyker to Imperial justice can be great, often significant enough to justify the risks of going against them!\nTo reflect their sanctioned or unsanctioned status, all psykers will have one of the two following skills on their profile:\nSanctioned Psyker:\n\u00a0A psyker with this skill may re-roll a failed Willpower test once per battle.\nNon-sanctioned Psykers:\n\u00a0Should a psyker with this skill be taken Out of Action, the enemy gang is rewarded a bounty of D3x10 credits at the end of the battle. Should a psyker with this skill be captured and sold to the Guilders, they are worth their full value. Note that when a psyker with this skill is captured, they can be sold immediately without the opportunity for a Rescue Mission.\nINFO\nWYRD POWERS AND THE FIREPOWER DICE\n\nSome Wyrd powers act as weapons that can be used by the psyker, however these powers can never run Out of Ammo. Therefore there is no need to roll a Firepower dice when attacking with a Wyrd power unless the attack has a Trait that triggers certain results on the Firepower dice.\nWYRD POWERS\n\nThere are many ways that a fighter may gain access to Wyrd Powers \u2013 one of the most common being the use of Ghast.

If a hit is scored, move the target D3\" in any direction \u2013 if they were Standing, they become Prone and Pinned after moving. If they come into base contact with a Standing fighter or any terrain, they stop moving and suffer a S3, AP -, D1 hit. If they come into base contact with another Standing fighter, that fighter also suffers a S3, AP -, D1 hit and becomes Prone and Pinned.\n2. PYROMANCY \u2013 FLAME BLAST (BASIC), CONTINUOUS EFFECT\n\nFlames envelop one of the wyrd\u2019s weapons, causing anything touched by it to similarly burst into fire.\nWhile this Wyrd Power is maintained, one weapon with the Melee or Versatile trait carried by this fighter gains the Blaze trait.\n3. CHRONOMANCY \u2013 FREEZE TIME (DOUBLE)\n\nReality seems to thicken all around the fighter, and events slow down to a crawl \u2013 has time truly stopped, or are those caught in the power merely experiencing its flow differently?\nAll fighters, friend and foe, within 12\" of this fighter may only perform a single action when activated for the remainder of this round.\n4. TECHNOMANCY \u2013 WEAPON JINX (SIMPLE)\n\nWith a snap of their fingers, the wyrd causes an enemy\u2019s weapon to malfunction.\nChoose an enemy fighter that is within 18\" of this fighter. That enemy fighter must immediately make an Ammo test for one of their weapons, chosen by this fighter\u2019s controlling player.\n5. TELEPATHY \u2013 TERRIFY (DOUBLE)\n\nPlanting a horrific image in an enemy\u2019s mind, the wyrd tries to break their spirit.\nChoose a single enemy fighter that is both within 18\" and line of sight of this fighter. That fighter must immediately take a Nerve test with a -3 modifier applied to the roll or becomes Broken.\n6. BIOMANCY \u2013 QUICKENING (BASIC), CONTINUOUS EFFECT\n\nThe wyrd pours psychic energy into their muscles, greatly increasing their reflexes.\nWhile this Wyrd Power is maintained, improve this fighter\u2019s Movement characteristic by 3 and their Weapon Skill, Ballistic Skill and Initiative characteristics by 1 (to a maximumof 2+).\nLast updated\u00a0on",

The standard ways in which Experience is gained are detailed here. Experience is also gained by completing scenario objectives \u2013 these will be detailed in the scenario. Players should note that, for the purposes of gaining Experience, vehicle crew are considered to be fighters.\nA model gains XP for any of the following actions:\n1 XP if their action directly causes an enemy fighter to suffer one or more Serious Injuries.*\n2 XP if their action causes an enemy vehicle to become Wrecked.\n2 XP if their action directly causes an enemy fighter to go Out of Action.*\nIf the enemy fighter is a Leader or a Champion, gain an extra 1 XP.\n1 XP if they took part in a battle (this XP is only gained if the scenario does not grant XP for a model taking part in the battle).\n1 XP if they are Broken and successfully rally.\n1 XP if they provide Assistance to another fighter making a Recovery test who becomes Prone and Pinned.\nNote that fighters can only gain XP for Seriously Injuring or taking an enemy fighter Out of Action once per enemy fighter per activation. For instance, if a fighter causes an enemy fighter to suffer a Serious Injury, and then performs a Coup De Grace (Free) action, they would only gain the 2 XP for causing the enemy fighter to go Out of Action.\nHOUSE RULE (A&A)\nAdditonal ways to earn XP:\nD3 XP for the MVP of each playing team. This is nominated by your opponent at the end of the match.\nD3 XP for each fully painted model. This is awarded at the start of the campaign (or when they join your gang). If a model is unpainted, it gains the D3XP when it becomes painted.\n+1 additional XP when taking a Brute Out of Action.\nADVANCEMENTS\n\nAt the end of a battle, during the post-battle sequence, each player has the chance to purchase Advancements for any of their models by spending some or all of the XP that model has accrued. The XP cost of these Advancements is shown on the following tables. The model\u2019s card is updated accordingly with the Advancement taken, the model\u2019s XP is reduced by the amount spent to purchase the Advancement, the model\u2019s total number of Advancements is increased by one (on the gang roster) and the model\u2019s Cost is adjusted by the amount of credits shown, which will in turn increase the Gang Rating.\nThe more experienced a model is, the more certain Advancements cost to purchase in terms of XP. The cost of each characteristic Advancement for the same characteristic taken is increased by 2 XP for each instance after the first. For example, a Champion may increase their Initiative by 1 for 5 XP, but to increase it by 1 a second time will cost them 7 XP. Juves and Prospects however are particularly fast learners, and as a result they suffer no such penalty on characteristic increases; they may increase a characteristic any number of times (up to the maximum \u2013 see\u00a0\nFighter Profiles\n) for the basic XP cost shown each time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGANGERS\n\nWhilst Leaders, Champions, Prospects, Juves and Specialists are central to a gang\u2019s narrative, Gangers are its \u2018supporting cast\u2019. As such, they spend Experience and gain Advancements in a simplified manner.\nIf during the post-battle sequence a Ganger has 6 XP or more, the controlling player must roll 2D6 on the table below, and then update the Ganger\u2019s Fighter card and their Cost accordingly, before finally reducing their XP by 6.",

In addition to these maximums, no fighter may improve their Movement, Strength or Toughness characteristics more than twice beyond that given in the basic profile for a fighter of their current category. No fighter may improve their Wounds or Attacks characteristics more than once beyond that given in the basic profile for a fighter of their current category.\nIf a roll on the Advancement table for a Ganger has no option but to increase a characteristic beyond its maximum, treat it as a roll of 12 instead.\nYAQ\nThe fighter keeps improved stats above the new class maximum characteristics (for example Movement). However, if the fighter (after promotion) later receives stat decrease injury bringing them back to the current class max, the fighter will forever be unable to go above the max again (with future advancements or bionics).\nSKILLS\n\nSkills can be obtained by Leaders, Champions, Prospects, Juves, crews and Specialists. The skills that are available are divided into a number of universal\u00a0\nSkill Sets\n. In addition, most gangs have their own unique Skill Set that represents the unique character of that gang or the House to which it belongs. These Skill Sets are presented alongside that Gang list.\nEach gang fights in its own way, and this is reflected by the Skill Sets that are available to the fighters that make up that gang. All fighters have different levels of skill access depending upon their type and the gang to which they belong; for example, a House Goliath Forge Boss (Champion) can gain Brawn skills more easily than a House Escher Little Sister (Juve). In each Gang list, and for certain other types of fighter (Exotic Beasts and Brutes, for example), details are given showing the Skill Sets available to those fighters. Fighters have Primary access to some Skill Sets, and Secondary access to others. Certain fighters can access skills from other sets, but to do so is more expensive in terms of XP.\nGAINING A NEW SKILL\n\nWhenever a fighter gains a new skill, it will either be chosen by the controlling player or determined randomly. How a new skill is determined will depend upon how much XP has been spent to gain the skill or if the skill is Primary, Secondary or neither, as detailed in the\u00a0\nAdvancements table\n.\nChoosing a Skill:\n\u00a0Choosing a skill is a simple matter of selecting a desirable skill from one of the Skill Sets available to that fighter.\nGaining a Random Skill:\n\u00a0Every skill in each Skill Set is numbered between 1 and 6. When a fighter gains a random skill, the player chooses a Skill Set to generate that skill from and rolls a D6. This roll determines which skill from the chosen Skill Set the fighter gains. If the fighter already has that skill, or cannot take that skill, simply re-roll the D6 until a skill the fighter does not have or can take is rolled.\nLast updated\u00a0on",

Some of these only apply during Campaign play, and can therefore be skipped during Skirmish play, as mentioned in the appropriate entries. Whatever the case, this sequence must be followed in the order shown, and must be done while both players are present.\nThe post-battle sequence has seven steps:\nWrap-up\nAssign/Reassign Territory\nReceive Rewards\nCollect Income\nPost-battle Actions\nUpdate Roster\nReport Results\n1. WRAP-UP\n\nDuring the Wrap-up, each player checks to see whether any fighters that were Prone and Seriously Injured when the battle ended, or that fled from the battlefield whilst Prone and Seriously Injured, succumb to their injuries, as described as follows. Additionally, during the Wrap-up players determine whether any fighters captured by the enemy manage to escape, as described as follows, after which any vehicles that were abandoned by fleeing crew (as described as follows) are retrieved.\nFinally, during a battle fought as part of a campaign, it is at the end of the Wrap-up that fighters that were In Recovery are considered to have made a full recovery, and their In Recovery box on the gang roster is cleared.\nPlayers should note that any other events that take place \u2018at the end of the battle\u2019 will also take place during the Wrap-up.\nSUCCUMBING TO INJURIES\n\nIf a fighter is Prone and Seriously Injured when the battle ends, or if a fighter belonging to a gang that had bottled out fled from the battlefield whilst Prone and Seriously Injured, roll a D6 for them during the Wrapup. On a 3 or more, they survive without any further complications, but on a 1 or 2 they succumb to the injuries suffered during the battle and are treated as having gone Out of Action. A Lasting Injury roll is made for them, as described previously.\nBEING CAPTURED\n\nAfter the battle there is a chance that any fighters who have been captured by the opposing gang may be able to slip away while being taken away:\nCapturing Enemy Fighters:\n\u00a0Roll a D6 for each friendly fighter that suffered a Captured result (55-56) on the Lasting Injury chart and apply the below modifiers:\n1 if the battle was a draw.\n2 if the fighter\u2019s gang lost the battle.\n2 if the fighter was taken Out of Action while subject to the Webbed condition.\nIf the result is 4+ then the fighter successfully escapes their bonds before being dragged away and goes into Convalescence (a natural roll of a 6 always results in the captive escaping). Otherwise the fighter has been Captured \u2013 make a note in the Lasting Injury/Captured By box on the gang roster for the Captured fighter, recording the name of the gang who has Captured the fighter.\nCLAIMING SCRAP\n\nIf only one gang has models left on the battlefield at the start of the Wrap-up, they will grab what they can from Wrecked enemy vehicles before leaving the battlefield. That gang adds D3x10 credits to their Stash for each Wrecked enemy vehicle on the battlefield. The Wrecked vehicles are then reclaimed by their gang.\nCAPTIVE FIGHTERS\n\nWhilst a fighter is Captured, they are said to be a \u2018Captive\u2019. That fighter is unavailable for battles and post-battle actions as if they were In Recovery. This lasts until that fighter is recovered (as follows), rather than for just one battle. The Capturing gang should make a note in their Stash of the fighter they now hold Captive.\nWhen a fighter is Captured, their gang has a chance to rescue them.

Additionally, once a Rescue Mission has been attempted and failed, the gang that holds the Captive is free to trade it to any gang they wish.\nThis trade could be a payment of credits, a trade for another Captive, a valuable item of equipment, even surrendering a Territory, or anything else \u2013 it is entirely up to the two players to decide and either gang is free to decline an offer made by the other. If an agreement is reached, the Captive is transferred to the gang that the trade was made with. If the Captive is returned through a trade to the gang it belongs to, they immediately become available to the gang once more.\n2. ASSIGN/REASSIGN TERRITORY\n\nThe player that won the battle takes control of the Territory staked on the battle.

In the case of a draw during the Takeover phase when a controlled Territory is at stake, the Territory does not change hands.\n3. RECEIVE REWARDS\n\nEach scenario shows a list of rewards which the gangs can receive, based on their performance during the battle. Any equipment gained is added to the gang\u2019s Stash \u2013 it can be distributed to fighters in step 6.\nHOUSE RULE (A&A)\nScenario Rewards are capped at 4D6 (x10 Credits). this means you cannot roll more than 4 D6 dice when determining your rewards, rather than making a separate roll to determine your reward cap.\nGAINING AND LOSING REPUTATION\n\nMost scenarios contain a number of ways in which a gang can gain or lose Reputation. If a gang both gains and loses Reputation, any gains are applied before any losses.\n4. COLLECT INCOME\n\nEach gang collects income from each Territory they control that generates income, as detailed for that Territory. The total amount of credits generated from each gang\u2019s Territories is then added to the gang\u2019s Stash.\n5. POST-BATTLE ACTIONS\n\nDuring a campaign, each fighter in the gang that has the Gang Hierarchy (X) special rule can make one post-battle action. Each of these actions is carried out one at a time, in an order of the controlling player\u2019s choice. Fighters who are In Recovery, or who have been Captured, cannot make post-battle actions.

How the fighter is disposed of varies depending upon the type of gang in question. Some captives are sacrificed in dark rituals, others are eaten, and yet more simply disappear. Whatever the case, the Captive\u2019s controlling player should be informed as soon as possible that their fighter has been disposed of, and must delete that fighter from their roster.\nMEDICAL ESCORT\n\nThe fighter escorts a critically injured fellow gang member to the Doc. Select one other fighter or crew in the gang that suffered a Critical Injury during the battle and pay 2D6x10 credits from the gang\u2019s Stash. If the gang does not have sufficient funds, or does not wish to pay the full amount, no roll is made and the fighter or crew dies. Otherwise, roll a D6 on the table below:\n\n\n\n\nNEGOTIATE REPAIRS\n\nThe fighter accompanies the crew of a vehicle that has suffered Lasting Damage to the Chop Shop. Select one vehicle in the gang that has sustained Lasting Damage and roll a D6 on the table below to determine the cost of repairs. If the gang wishes to meet this cost, it pays with credits from its Stash and all Lasting Damage previously sustained is removed from the vehicle. If the gang does not have sufficient funds, or does not wish to pay the amount, the vehicle is not repaired and the Lasting Damage it has sustained is not removed:\n\n\n\n\n6. UPDATE ROSTER\n\nDuring this step of the post-battle sequence, gangs can dispose of dead and injured fighters, scrap damaged vehicles, purchase new equipment and models, and more. During this step, players should follow this sequence:\nA. Clean House\nB. Visit the Trading Post\nC. Gain Boons from Territories\nD. Distribute Equipment\nE. Purchase Advancements\nF. Update Gang Rating\nA. CLEAN HOUSE\n\nAfter any battle, a gang is likely to have dead fighters to dispose of, injured fighters to retire, and wrecked vehicles to sell for scrap. This process is generally referred to as \u2018cleaning house\u2019.\nDead fighters or vehicle crew are simply deleted from the roster. If their gang had at least one fighter on the battlefield at the end of the battle, or if the fighter was taken to the Doc but still died, all of their equipment (except for armour) is added to the gang\u2019s Stash. Otherwise, the dead fighter\u2019s equipment is lost. If they were crew, their vehicle is added to the gang\u2019s Stash and can be given to a new crew.\nAlso at this point, the controlling player can choose to retire fighters or vehicle crews \u2013 usually because Lasting Injuries have rendered them unfit for battle.

The crew must be either given a new vehicle, one must be purchased for them or they are retired.\nB. VISIT THE TRADING POST\n\nThe gang can visit the Trading Post to spend its hardearned credits in any of the ways described below, allowing them to hire new fighters and buy or sell equipment. The actions can be made in any order and, unless specified, there is no limit to how many times a gang can perform each one.

No Upgrades are purchased for this vehicle \u2013 it receives Upgrades in a later step.\nRecruit Hangers-on & Brutes:\n\u00a0The gang can spend credits to add a Hanger-on or a Brute to their roster. Their Reputation must be sufficient to allow this.\nSell Unwanted Items:\n\u00a0Any items in the gang\u2019s Stash can be sold. The item is deleted from the Stash, and the gang gains its value in credits, minus D6x10 (to a minimum of 5 credits).\nNote that equipment granted as a Territory Boon cannot be sold during the same post-battle sequence.\nPurchase Equipment:\n\u00a0Equipment can be purchased for any model from its own Equipment List at the price shown (this cannot be added to the gang\u2019s Stash during this post-battle sequence). A gang can purchase Common equipment from the Trading Post, at the price shown, adding it to its Stash.

Some players like to roll everything in front of their opponent and then go away and decide exactly how to spend their credits and XP, while others prefer to resolve all these in the pre-battle sequence of their next battle.\nIn the end, these options all work as long as both players and the Arbitrator (in Campaign play) agree.\nC.

BOTTLE CHECKS\n\nAt the start of the End phase, a player will be required to make a Bottle check for their gang if one or more of their fighters are currently either Prone and Seriously Injured or Out of Action, or if one or more of their vehicles is currently Wrecked. If both players are required to make a Bottle check, the player that holds Priority should go first.\nTo make a Bottle check for their gang, the controlling player rolls a D6 and adds to the result the total number of fighters belonging to their gang that are currently Prone and Seriously Injured or Out of Action and the total number of vehicles belonging to their gang that are currently Wrecked. If the final result is higher than the total number of models in its starting crew (the number of models that were present at the start of the battle, see\u00a0\nChoosing Crews\n), the Bottle check is failed and the gang has \u2018bottled out\u2019. If the scenario uses Reinforcements, instead of comparing to the number of models in its starting crew, compare the total to the number of models that were eligible to take part in the battle.\nNote that once a gang has bottled out, there is no need to make any further Bottle check for it. It is considered to have bottled out for the remainder of the battle.\nHOUSE RULE (A&A)\nReinforcements count towards bottle tests.\nA voluntary fail automatically loses the match.\n2. FLEEING THE BATTLEFIELD\n\nOnce a gang has bottled out, both fighters and vehicles alike may begin to flee the battlefield. During this step of the End phase, starting with the gang that holds Priority if both gangs have bottled out, the controlling player makes a Cool test for each of their models that is currently on the battlefield:\nIf the test is passed, the model holds its nerve and remains on the battlefield.\nIf the test is failed, the model chooses discretion over valour and it (or in the case of a vehicle, its crew) flees the battlefield.\nWhat happens to a model when it flees the battlefield will depend firstly upon whether it is a fighter or a vehicle and, secondly, upon its current Secondary Status:\nShould a fighter flee the battlefield whilst their Secondary Status is Active, Engaged or Pinned, they are simply removed from play with no ill effect.\nShould a fighter flee the battlefield whilst their Secondary Status is Seriously Injured, they are removed from play and set to one side.

Any Standing and Active or Prone and Pinned fighters, and all vehicles, immediately flee the battlefield as described above. Engaged fighters must attempt to break away from combat \u2013 make an Initiative test for each. If the test is passed, they flee the battlefield. If the test is failed, they become Prone and Seriously Injured. Once the gang that has declared that it will flee has only Prone and Seriously Injured fighters remaining on the battlefield, the battle ends. Roll to see if Prone and Seriously Injured fighters succumb to their injuries in the Wrap-up as usual.\nGANG HIERARCHY\n\nSome models, most notably Leaders and Champions, have a special rule called \u2018Gang Hierarchy (X)\u2019 listed on their profile. In all such cases, the \u2018X\u2019 in brackets will be replaced by the model\u2019s rank (\u2018Leader\u2019 or \u2018Champion\u2019):\nGang Hierarchy (X):\n\u00a0During a battle, once this model\u2019s gang has failed a Bottle check, during any End phase in which this model passes its Cool test and does not flee the battlefield, any friendly models that are within 12\" (if this model is a Leader) or 6\" (if this model is a Champion) of this model will automatically pass their Cool test and will not flee the battlefield.\n3. RECOVER & RESTART\n\nStarting with the player that holds Priority, both players make Recovery tests for any Prone and Seriously Injured fighters belonging to their gang to see if they recover sufficiently to return to the fight. Similarly, both players make Restart tests for any Stationary and Stalled vehicles belonging to their gang to see if they can be restarted and become Mobile once again.\nRECOVERY TESTS\n\nFor each member of their gang that is Prone and Seriously Injured and still on the battlefield, the controlling player makes a Recovery test by rolling an Injury dice:\nIf the result is Out of Action, the fighter is removed from play.\nIf the result is Seriously Injured, the fighter suffers a Flesh Wound and remains as they are \u2013 Prone and Seriously Injured.\nIf the result is a Flesh Wound, the fighter suffers a Flesh Wound and becomes Prone and Pinned.\nAssistance:\n\u00a0When making a Recovery test for a Prone and Seriously Injured fighter, one Standing and Active friendly fighter that is within 1\" can offer assistance. If they do so, roll one extra Injury dice then pick one of the Injury dice to resolve and discard the other. In addition, a fighter that is being assisted does not suffer a Flesh Wound regardless of the result of the Injury dice.\nA fighter can only assist one Recovery test per End phase.\nMultiple Injury Dice:\n\u00a0It may happen that, due to assistance, items of Wargear, Tactics cards or skills that, when making a Recovery test, several Injury dice are rolled. Regardless of how many are rolled, one Injury dice is picked and resolved \u2013 the others are discarded, as described previously.\nRESTART TESTS\n\nFor each vehicle belonging to their gang that is currently Stationary and Stalled, the controlling player makes a Restart test. To make a Restart test, make a Handling test for the vehicle, applying a +1 modifier unless the vehicle has only 1 HP remaining:\nIf the Handling test is passed, the vehicle immediately Restarts, changing its Status from Stationary and Stalled to Mobile.\nIf the Handling test is failed, the vehicle refuses to Restart and it remains Stationary and Stalled.\nWOUNDED DRIVERS\n\nFinally during this step, if any vehicles in a player\u2019s gang have suffered a Driver Wounded damage effect, a D6 is rolled for that driver, as described in\u00a0\nCrew Damage Table: Drive Wounded\n.\n4.",

        "e8806ac2-3b50-45d9-aba3-cef65b0fce26": "RESOLVING HITS AGAINST VEHICLES\nSource: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)\nWhen a vehicle suffers a Hit, follow this sequence:\nDetermine Facing of Attack\nMake Wound Roll\nMake Save Roll\nDetermine Damage\n1. DETERMINE FACING OF ATTACK\n\nAs noted in\u00a0\nVehicle Characteristics\n, all vehicles have three Toughness characteristics: Front, Side and Rear \u2013 each of which corresponds to the vehicle\u2019s different vision arcs, as shown in the diagram below.\n\nEvery hit a vehicle suffers is resolved against one of these \u2018facings\u2019. Which facing has been hit depends upon where the attacking model is in relation to the vehicle. To determine this, imaginary lines are drawn from the vehicle, as shown in the diagram; whichever arc the centre of the attacking model\u2019s base (or central hole in the case of a\u00a0\nBlast marker\n) is in is the facing hit.\nIf there is ever any doubt as to which facing has been hit (for example, if the imaginary line runs through the centre of the attacking model), the better Toughness value is always used.\nINFO\nHULL DOWN VEHICLES\n\nSometimes, the attacking model will not be able to see any of the vehicle facing whose arc they are in. In these cases the vehicle is said to be hull down, and gains the benefit of being in Full Cover even if not sufficiently obscured.\n2. MAKE WOUND ROLL\n\nWhenever a Wound roll is made against a vehicle, it is always the opposing player that makes it. Cross reference the weapon\u2019s Strength with the Toughness of the facing hit on the vehicle and roll a D6 on the table below to determine if the vehicle is wounded by the attack:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. MAKE SAVE ROLL\n\nIf a hit results in a successful Wound roll, or leads to a Damage roll being made against the vehicle for any reason, the vehicle may be able to make a Save roll. This is done in exactly the\u00a0\nsame way as for fighters\n.\n4. DETERMINE DAMAGE\n\nFollowing an unsuccessful Save roll, instead of inflicting damage as normal, the opposing player should roll both the Damage dice and Location dice simultaneously. It is always the opposing player that rolls Damage dice and Location dice.\nA. LOCATION HIT\n\nOne or more Location dice are rolled to determine the exact location hit.\nIn some cases, it will be impossible to hit a certain location from a specific facing (as described in the vehicle\u2019s special rules). Should it ever occur that an impossible location has been hit, simply re-roll the Location dice until a location that can be hit is rolled.\nMULTIPLE LOCATION DICE\n\nPlayers should note that, in some cases, more than one Location dice is rolled. When this is the case, it is usual for the player that made the roll to choose a single result to resolve and discard the other dice. Sometimes, however, it may be the player that controls the vehicle that chooses which result to apply. When this is the case, the rules will always make it clear.\nIn some cases, all of the Location dice rolled may be applied. For example, if a vehicle has suffered several hits at once from a Rapid Fire (X) weapon, a number of Location dice equal to the number of Hits is rolled. Again, when this is the case, the rules will always make it clear.\nB. ROLL DAMAGE DICE\n\nAfter a vehicle has been wounded, a number of Damage dice equal to the Damage characteristic are rolled. Unlike when rolling Injury dice for a wounded fighter, this is done every time a vehicle is successfully wounded regardless of Hull Points remaining.\nRegardless of how many Damage dice are rolled, only one result is applied against the vehicle for each hit suffered \u2013 the benefit of rolling extra dice is an increased chance of inflicting significant damage! If more than one Damage dice is rolled for a hit, one result is chosen and the others are discarded. When this is the case, it is usual for the player that made the roll to choose a single result to resolve and discard the other dice. Sometimes, however, it may be the player that controls the vehicle that chooses which result to apply. When this is the case, the rules will always make it clear.\nIn some cases, more than one of the Damage dice rolled for a single hit may be applied. When this is the case, the rules will always make it clear.\nDAMAGE DICE\n\nDamage dice are special dice used to determine the severity of the damage caused to a vehicle. Each face is marked with one of three different symbols. These are:\n\n\n\nDAMAGE TABLES\n\nOnce the Damage dice have been rolled, look up on the following tables the effect of the chosen result(s) against the location hit. All damage effects applied are cumulative:\nBODY DAMAGE TABLE\n\n\n\n\n\nENGINE DAMAGE TABLE\n\n\n\n\n\nCREW DAMAGE TABLE",

Wrecked vehicles left in place in this way are treated as flimsy structures for the remainder of the battle. Alternatively, the model can simply be removed from play. In any case, the vehicle itself will suffer Lasting Damage, and any fighters aboard the vehicle will be Thrown Clear.\nTHROWN CLEAR\n\nWhen a vehicle is Wrecked, any fighters on board it are thrown clear. When a fighter is thrown clear, they are placed within 2\" of the vehicle and must take an Initiative test. If this test is passed, the fighter remains Standing. If, however, this test is failed, the fighter becomes Prone and Pinned and suffers a Hit as if they had fallen from the vehicle (see\u00a0\nFalling\n), increasing the Strength, AP and Damage of the hit by 1 if the vehicle was Mobile when Wrecked.\nINFO\nVEHICLES WITH MULTIPLE CREW\n\nVehicles may be crewed by many gangers, however, in the rules we treat all members of a vehicle\u2019s crew, regardless of number, as a single entity.\nINJURED CREW\n\nCrew can be taken Out of Action just like any other fighter. If a vehicle is Wrecked, the crew is automatically taken Out of Action. However, when rolling for Lasting Injury for the crew, roll on the following table:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLASTING DAMAGE\n\nWhenever a vehicle is Wrecked, the opposing player immediately rolls a D6 and looks up the result on the Lasting Damage table opposite. During Campaign play, all results are applied against the vehicle and a note of all Lasting Damage sustained made on the gang roster.\nIn some cases, a vehicle may become Wrecked in several ways at once (being reduced to 0 Hull Points before Rolling, for example). In such a case, a separate roll for each is made on the Lasting Damage table and each result is applied. Rolling for Lasting Damage must be done during Campaign play. Should players wish, they can forgo this step during Skirmish play.\nGOING INTO REPAIR\n\nIn some cases, a vehicle will become a Write-off. During Campaign play, this means that the vehicle is placed In Repair and cannot take part in any battles until it has been repaired (see\u00a0\nNegotiate Repairs\n).\nThe vehicle\u2019s In Repair box on the gang roster is checked to indicate this. Once the vehicle is repaired, it becomes available again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLOSS OF CONTROL TESTS\n\nSeveral of the vehicle damage effects, as well as some actions, require a player to make a Loss of Control test for the vehicle. This may be due to an impact with another vehicle or terrain, damage caused to the vehicle by enemy attacks, or even as a result of the driver falling unconscious at the controls due to injuries sustained. Whatever the case, failing a Loss of Control test can have dramatic results.\nTo make a Loss of Control test, make a Handling test for the vehicle, applying any modifiers as required:\nIf the test is passed, the driver maintains control of the vehicle and nothing untoward happens.\nIf the test is failed, the driver has lost control:\n\tIf the vehicle was Stationary, the force of the impact may turn the vehicle, causing it to pivot in place or, in extreme cases, to Roll.\n\tIf the vehicle was Mobile, the impact causes the vehicle to swerve dangerously and veer off course or, in extreme cases, to Roll.\nINFO\nFIGHTERS ON VEHICLES LOSING CONTROL\n\nIf a vehicle Swerves or Jackknifes then any fighters on it, and not in designated transport areas, must\u00a0\ntest to avoid falling\n.\nLOSING CONTROL\n\nWhen a Loss of Control test is failed, the vehicle\u2019s controlling player rolls a D6 and the Control dice:\nIf a Swerve is rolled on the Control dice, the vehicle pivots around its central point 45\u00b0.\nIf a Jackknife is rolled on the Control dice, the vehicle pivots around its central point 90\u00b0.\nIf a Roll is rolled on the Control dice, the vehicle is flipped over by the force of the impact.",

However, if a Mobile vehicle Swerves or Jackknifes, it will pivot and then move a number of inches equal to half its Movement characteristic.\nROLLING\n\nIf a Stationary vehicle Rolls, it will simply flip onto its side or roof in place, as described previously.

If a Hit is rolled, use the small arrow to determine direction.\nThe D3 determines how many times it rolls before coming to rest. The vehicle moves 2\" in the direction determined by the Scatter dice for each roll it makes. During this movement, the vehicle is considered to be moving as if it were an active model, does not change facing and all vehicle impacts are resolved as\u00a0\nHead-on Collisions\n. Note that the rolling vehicle takes no further damage.\nWhatever the case, Rolling onto its side or roof is extremely detrimental to a vehicle and will render it immobile.

Determining how badly damaged a model is and what the effects of that damage are differs between fighters and vehicles.\nRESOLVING HITS AGAINST FIGHTERS\n\nWhen a fighter suffers a Hit, follow this sequence:\nMake Wound Roll\nMake a Save Roll\nInflict Damage\n1. MAKE WOUND ROLL\n\nWhenever a Wound roll is made against a fighter, it is always the opposing player that makes it. Cross reference the weapon\u2019s Strength with the hit fighter\u2019s Toughness and roll a D6 on the table below to determine if the fighter is wounded by the attack:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. MAKE A SAVE ROLL\n\nIf a hit results in a successful Wound roll, or leads to an Injury roll being made against the fighter for any reason, the fighter may be able to make a Save roll.\nOnly one Save roll may be made for each hit that successfully wounds, or leads to an Injury roll being made, regardless of how many different Save rolls a fighter may have. For example, if a fighter wears both mesh armour and a refractor field, they may only attempt a Save roll against a successful Wound roll with one of those items.\nSave rolls are made either:\nAfter the Wound roll is made but before the Wound is removed from the fighter, in which case the Wound is \u2018saved\u2019 and not removed.\nIf the attack has a Damage \u2018-\u2019 characteristic and causes an Injury dice to be rolled against the fighter for any reason, a Save roll is made before any Injury dice are rolled.\nPlayers should note that some weapon traits will disallow Save rolls. For example, the Gas Weapon trait states that no Save roll can be made. In such cases, regardless of any modifiers, no Save roll can be made.\nArmour Penetration:\n\u00a0It may happen that the Armour Penetration (AP) characteristic of a weapon is greater than the Save roll granted by the armour a fighter wears, thus cancelling out the Save roll. For example, a fighter wearing mesh armour has a Save roll of 5+, but if they are hit by a weapon with AP -3, no Save roll would be possible.\nPositive Save Modifiers:\n\u00a0In some situations, such as a fighter benefitting from partial or full cover against an attack that uses a Blast marker, a fighter\u2019s Save roll may be improved. In such situations, this positive modifier may be added to a fighter\u2019s normal Save roll, but may not be added to Field armour. For example, if a fighter wearing mesh armour (5+ save) and a displacer field (4+ save) gains a +1 modifier to their Save roll, they may improve their mesh armour save to 4+ but may not improve their\u00a0\ndisplacer field\n\u00a0save to 3+.\nIf a fighter not wearing armour benefits from a positive save modifier, treat their save as 7+ for the purposes of modification. For example, if a fighter wearing no armour gains a +2 save modifier, they will be able to make a Save roll of 5+.\nRolls of a Natural 1:\n\u00a0A roll of a natural 1 when making a Save roll is always an automatic failure, regardless of any modifiers that may apply.\n3. INFLICT DAMAGE\n\nIf a successful Wound roll is not saved, damage is inflicted as follows:\nEach point of Damage caused by a weapon removes one Wound from a fighter.\nWhen a fighter is reduced to 0 Wounds by Damage from an attack, immediately roll one Injury dice and apply the result to the fighter (as follows).\nIf the weapon has additional points of Damage to cause after the last Wound has been removed, immediately roll an additional Injury dice for each and apply the result to the fighter.\nFor example, if a fighter with two Wounds is hit by a weapon that causes three points of Damage, two Injury dice will be rolled. The first point of Damage removes a Wound, the second reduces the fighter to 0 Wounds and one Injury dice is rolled, and the third and final point of Damage will cause another Injury dice to be rolled.\nINJURY DICE",

If this injury was inflicted in close combat, the fighter may be vulnerable to a\u00a0\nCoup De Grace (Simple)\n\u00a0action.\nShould a Prone and Seriously Injured fighter suffer one or more Serious Injury results, they suffer an additional Flesh Wound for each.\nFlesh Wound:\n\u00a0The fighter suffers a Flesh Wound, reducing their Toughness characteristic by 1.

No Wounds are removed from the fighter.\nThe fighter may suffer a Flesh Wound, indicating they have been weakened by the attack, may suffer a Serious Injury, representing their struggle to shake off the effects of the attack, or may be taken Out of Action as they succumb to the effects of the weapon.\nLASTING INJURIES\n\nWhenever a fighter goes Out of Action, the opposing player immediately rolls two D6, one after the other (a D66 roll) and looks up the result on the Lasting Injuries table (see opposite). During Campaign play, the result is applied against the fighter and a note of the Lasting Injury made on the Gang Roster.\nIf an Injury roll results in more than one Out of Action result, a separate roll for each is made on the Lasting Injuries table and each result is applied.\nRolling for Lasting Injuries must be done during Campaign play. Should players wish, they can forgo this step during Skirmish play, though making the roll and noting the result can add greatly to the narrative of the battle.\nHOUSE RULE (A&A)\nWhen a fighter goes Out of Action, only make one Lasting Injury roll, regardless of the number of Out of Action dice.\nGOING INTO CONVALESCENCE\n\nSome results will cause a fighter to go into Convalescence. During Campaign play, this means that the fighter cannot perform any post-battle actions or work any Territories. However, unlike going into Recovery, they will be available to fight in the gang\u2019s next battle.\nGOING INTO RECOVERY\n\nSome results will cause a fighter to go into Recovery. During Campaign play, this means that the fighter cannot take part in their gang\u2019s next battle, as they are recovering from their injuries.\nThe fighter\u2019s In Recovery box on the gang roster is checked, and the fighter must miss both the post- battle sequence of the current battle and their gang\u2019s next battle. This means that a fighter with the Gang Hierarchy (X) special rule that has gone into Recovery may not perform post-battle actions at this time. During the Wrap-up of the gang\u2019s next battle, the fighter\u2019s In Recovery box will be cleared, the fighter becomes available once again and Leaders and Champions may perform post-battle actions.\nNote that no matter how many Lasting Injury rolls are made, a fighter that goes into Recovery will only miss one battle rather than multiple battles.\nFALLING\n\nAs described in\u00a0\nTerrain: Falling\n, should a model ever fall 3\" or more, they will suffer an automatic hit. The Strength, AP and Damage of this hit is determined by how far the model fell, rounded up to the nearest inch:\n\n\n\n\n\nINFO\nCHARACTERISTIC REDUCTIONS\n\nSome results on the Lasting Injury table cause a permanent reduction to a fighter\u2019s characteristics.

TURN TO FACE\n\nThe attacking fighter may turn to face any direction.

Any remaining Attack dice must be allocated to a weapon with the Melee trait. If a fighter has no other weapons with the Melee trait, any remaining Attack dice must be allocated to Unarmed attacks, as described previously.\nIf a fighter attacks with a weapon with the Sidearm trait in close combat, Accuracy modifiers do not apply \u2013 this is only used when making ranged attacks.\nINFO\nFIGHTING ACROSS BARRICADES\n\nA fighter that is in base contact with an obstacle\nthat is less than 1\" wide counts as being engaged with an enemy fighter if that enemy fighter is in base contact with the other side of the obstacle, even though the fighters themselves are not in base to base contact.

ASSESS TARGET PRIORITY\n\nWhen a model makes a ranged attack, it must be against the closest eligible target. An eligible target is an enemy model that is within both the vision arc and line of sight of a fighter, or within the vision arc and line of sight of the weapon being fired by a vehicle.\nHOUSE RULE (NECRODAMUS, A&A)\nYou must target the closest visible enemy regardless of facing. This avoids facing fighters in awkward directions to circumvent the cool check for seeing the actual closest enemy.\nAn enemy model is an eligible target even if it is engaged by a friendly fighter. However, if the closest eligible target is Prone and Seriously Injured, Wrecked or harder to hit than one further away (due to negative modifiers applied to the Hit roll), the attacking model may choose to ignore it. Otherwise, to make a ranged attack against an eligible target that is not the closest, the attacking model must first pass a Cool test (in the case of a vehicle, use the Cool characteristic of either the crew, or the fighter manning the weapon being used, as appropriate). If this test is passed, the ranged attacks may be made against any eligible target. If it is failed, a ranged attack can only be made against the closest eligible target.\nFighters in Hiding:\n\u00a0The attacking model cannot target an enemy fighter if they are both Prone (either Pinned or Seriously Injured) and in partial or full cover \u2013 they are assumed to be keeping their head very low!\n2. DECLARE THE SHOT\n\nOnce target priority has been assessed, choose a ranged weapon the model is armed with, and nominate an eligible target to be the target of the ranged attack.\n3. MEASURE RANGE\n\nNext, measure the distance between the model making the ranged attack and the target, to ensure that the target is within the range of the weapon. In the case of a fighter, range is measured from the model to the nearest point of the target model. In the case of a vehicle, range is measured from the weapon to the nearest point of the target model.\nIf the target is outside the weapon\u2019s Long range, the attack automatically misses. However, the Firepower dice must still be rolled.\nINFO\nThe first example shows the distance measured between a fighter and the closest point of an enemy vehicle. The second example shows the range measured between a weapon mounted on a vehicle and the closest point of an enemy fighter. Note that, in the second example, the weapon itself is not the closest point of the vehicle to the enemy fighter.\n\n4. MAKE THE HIT ROLL\n\nA Hit roll is a Ballistic Skill test made against the BS of the model making the shot. In the case of a fighter, use the BS of the fighter. In the case of a vehicle, use the BS of either the crew, or the fighter manning the weapon being used, as appropriate. The following modifiers may apply to the Hit roll:\nIn Partial Cover (-1):\n\u00a0If the target is in partial cover (see\u00a0\nCover\n), apply a -1 modifier.\nIn Full Cover (-2):\n\u00a0If the target is in full cover (see\u00a0\nCover\n), apply a -2 modifier.\nAccuracy Modifier (+/-?):\n\u00a0If the weapon has an accuracy modifier on its profile and the target is within that range, apply the modifier.\nTarget is Engaged (-1):\n\u00a0If the target is Standing and Engaged, apply a -1 modifier.\nTarget is Prone (-1, Long Range Only):\n\u00a0If the target is Prone (either Pinned or Seriously Injured) and the attacker is firing at Long range, apply a -1 modifier.\nTarget is a Point on the Battlefield (-2):\n\u00a0If the target is a point on the battlefield and the weapon being fired does not have the Smoke trait, apply a -2 modifier.\nRolls of a Natural 1:\n\u00a0If, when making a ranged attack, the hit roll is a natural 1, the attack automatically misses, regardless of any modifiers that may apply.\nImprobable Shots:\n\u00a0If the negative modifiers applied to a Hit roll mean that it is impossible to score a hit, the attack is an Improbable Shot.",
        "afe2d199-157b-4c75-b3f7-a067b7c715d5": "Target is Engaged (-1):\n\u00a0If the target is Standing and Engaged, apply a -1 modifier.\nTarget is Prone (-1, Long Range Only):\n\u00a0If the target is Prone (either Pinned or Seriously Injured) and the attacker is firing at Long range, apply a -1 modifier.\nTarget is a Point on the Battlefield (-2):\n\u00a0If the target is a point on the battlefield and the weapon being fired does not have the Smoke trait, apply a -2 modifier.\nRolls of a Natural 1:\n\u00a0If, when making a ranged attack, the hit roll is a natural 1, the attack automatically misses, regardless of any modifiers that may apply.\nImprobable Shots:\n\u00a0If the negative modifiers applied to a Hit roll mean that it is impossible to score a hit, the attack is an Improbable Shot. To make a Hit roll for an Improbable Shot, roll a D6. On a 1-5, the attack misses. On a 6, there is a chance that it will hit; make a second Hit roll as normal, using only the fighter\u2019s Ballistic Skill and ignoring any other modifiers.\nHIT FIGHTERS BECOME PINNED\n\nThe vast majority of fighters, when they find themselves under enemy fire, will duck for cover and attempt to keep their head down. To represent this, when a Standing and Active fighter is hit by a ranged attack, they are automatically placed Prone and Pinned. Players should note that a Standing and Engaged fighter cannot become Prone and Pinned.\n5. RESOLVE HITS\n\nFor each BS test that is passed when making a Hit roll, a hit is scored. Each hit scored is resolved as described in\u00a0\nResolving Hits\n.\nSTRAY SHOTS\n\nIf an attack with a ranged weapon misses, there is a chance that another fighter, friend or foe, that is Engaging the target will be hit. Equally, there is a chance that any model, friend or foe, that is within 1\" of the line along which the range between the attacker and the target was measured, will be hit.\nIf the attack misses, roll a D6 for each model that is at risk of being hit, starting with the model closest to the attacker. On the roll of 1, 2 or 3, that model is hit by the attack. On a 4, 5 or 6, the shot misses it \u2013 move on to the next model at risk of being hit.\nHOUSE RULE (NECRODAMUS, A&A)\nStray shots only hit other fighters on a 6+.\nIf the attack would have caused more than one hit, follow this sequence for every hit.\nINFO\nTWIN GUNS BLAZING\n\nIf a fighter is armed with two weapons that both have the Sidearm trait, they can fire both at the same time, targeting the same enemy model, as part of a single Shoot (Basic) action. Make the Hit roll for each weapon being used before resolving any hits scored. Both attacks must be made against the same target and the Hit roll for each suffers a -1 modifier.\nTHE FIREPOWER DICE\n\nEvery time an attack is made with a ranged weapon (including when using a weapon with the Sidearm trait in close combat), a Firepower dice must also be rolled. Even if no Hit roll is made for the attack, and even if the weapon does not have the Rapid Fire trait, a Firepower dice must still be rolled.\nFor example, if the target is found to be out of range when measuring range, the attack will automatically miss, but a Firepower dice must still be rolled. Or if the weapon has the Template trait, meaning models touched by the Flame template are automatically hit, a Firepower dice must still be rolled.\nIf the Ammo symbol is rolled, there is a chance the weapon has run Out of Ammo, jammed, or encountered some other malfunction.\nImmediately make an Ammo test for the weapon, testing against its Ammo characteristic. If this test is passed, nothing happens. If this test is failed, the weapon itself becomes subject to the Out of Ammo condition. The attack that caused the Ammo test to be made is then resolved as normal, but the weapon cannot be used again until it is reloaded by performing a successful Reload (Simple) action for it.\n\nMost of the faces on the Firepower dice feature a number of bullet holes: one, two or three. In most cases, rolling one of these symbols means the weapon hasn\u2019t run out of ammo, jammed or otherwise malfunctioned. If, however, the weapon being fired has the Rapid Fire (X) trait, the number of bullet holes rolled indicates the number of shots made.",

Rolling this symbol doesn\u2019t mean that the attack itself misses, based on the Ballistic Skill test the attack may still hit its target. However, regardless of the Ballistic Skill test, something has gone wrong and an Ammo test must be made.\nINFO\nMULTIPLE WEAPON PROFILES\n\nSome weapons have more than one weapon profile \u2013 shotguns, for example, can be loaded with several different types of ammunition. When declaring a ranged attack with such a weapon, the player must declare which profile they will use, chosen from the profiles available. For example, a shotgun may fire \u2018solid\u2019 and \u2018scatter\u2019 ammo as standard, and may be loaded with and use \u2018executioner\u2019 ammo if purchased.\nShould a weapon with more than one weapon profile fail an Ammo test for one of its profiles, it is considered to have failed an Ammo test for all of its profiles.\nThe weapon cannot be used at all until a Reload (Simple) action has been successfully performed, using any one of the weapon\u2019s available profiles, chosen by the controlling player.\nIf a profile that has either the Scarce or Limited trait fails an Ammo test, that profile may not be used for the remainder of the battle.\nBLAST MARKERS\n\nWhen making a ranged attack with a weapon that has the Blast (X) trait, a model may target a point on the battlefield instead of an eligible target, though if they do so the shot will have a -2 modifier to hit unless the weapon also has the Smoke trait:\nPlace the appropriately sized Blast marker (determined by the number in brackets after the trait on the weapon\u2019s profile) so that the central hole is anywhere within line of sight of the model making the attack.\nMeasure the distance between the attacking model and the Blast marker. If the central hole is beyond the Long range of the weapon, the Blast marker is moved directly back towards the attacking model until the central hole is within range.\nMake a Hit roll as normal:\n\tIf the attack hits, the Blast marker stays where it is.\n\tOtherwise, roll a Scatter dice and a D6. The Blast marker moves in the direction shown by the Scatter dice (using the small arrow if the Hit symbol is rolled) a number of inches equal to the number rolled on the D6. The marker will stop moving if the central hole comes into contact with a solid or impassable feature.\nOnce the Blast marker\u2019s position has been established, every model (friend or foe) that lies beneath the Blast marker (fully or partially) is hit by the attack (unless there is a solid terrain feature between them and the centre of the Blast marker).\nFollow step 5 of the Shooting sequence as normal for each model hit, in an order of the attacking player\u2019s choice. Players should note that, after scattering, the Blast marker may end beyond the weapon\u2019s range or out of line of sight.\nMisfires:\n\u00a0If a Hit is rolled on the Scatter dice and a 1 is rolled on the D6, something has gone wrong. Roll another D6. On a 2-6, the shot is a dud; the attack ends and the Blast marker is removed. If the roll is a 1, the weapon has misfired; centre the Blast marker over the attacking model and resolve the attack as normal.\nFLAME TEMPLATES\n\nIf attacking with any weapon with the Template trait, the weapon will make use of the Flame template to determine which fighters are hit by the attack:\nIgnore step 1 of the Shooting sequence.\nDuring step 2 of the Shooting sequence, instead of declaring an enemy to be the target of the attack, place the Flame template so that the narrow end is touching the attacking fighter\u2019s base and the entire template is within their vision arc.",

If the fighter hit was wearing no armour, they would gain a 6+ Save roll against the attack.\nLast updated\u00a0on",

One of the most obvious ways in which models interact with terrain is when they attempt to move through and over it. The following section covers the various ways in which terrain affects a model\u2019s movement.\nDIFFICULT TERRAIN\n\nFrom pools of stagnant sludge or areas of fallen rubble deep in the underhive, to areas of uneven and rocky ground in the ash wastes \u2013 there are numerous things that can make terrain difficult to cross.\nFor every 1\" a fighter moves through any terrain designated as difficult terrain when setting up the battlefield, it counts as having moved 2\".\nDANGEROUS TERRAIN\n\nVats of toxic chems, jagged rocks so sharp they can tear through plates of armour and drive shafts with ease, and more besides \u2013 any terrain feature designated as dangerous when setting up the battlefield can pose a huge risk to models crossing it.\nA model may cross dangerous terrain in the same way as difficult terrain. However, a fighter must also pass an Initiative test, whilst a vehicle must also pass a Handling test. If this test is passed, the model crosses the terrain safely. If it is failed, a fighter will immediately go\u00a0\nOut of Action\n, whilst a vehicle will suffer an immediate\u00a0\nCatastrophic hit to its Drive\n.\nINFO\nVEHICLES AND DIFFICULT TERRAIN\n\nHow a vehicle interacts with difficult terrain depends upon how the vehicle moves. This will be indicated in the vehicle\u2019s rules.\nWheeled:\n\u00a0Wheeled vehicles are able to reach high speeds but struggle to maintain this speed over rough terrain. For every 1\" a wheeled vehicle moves through difficult terrain, it counts as having moved 2\".\nTracked:\n\u00a0Tracked vehicles are designed to keep going over all terrain \u2013 though they struggle to reach high speeds. A tracked vehicle suffers no penalty for moving over difficult terrain.\nSkimmers:\n\u00a0Skimmers ignore all difficult terrain and dangerous terrain when moving. However, if it ends its activation on difficult terrain or dangerous terrain, it must make a Handling test. If the test is passed, it has successfully negotiated the terrain. If it is failed, it suffers an immediate Catastrophic hit to its Drive.\nFIGHTER MOVEMENT ON VEHICLES\n\nIn the ash wastes, gang members scramble over vehicles as they race along, engaging in rooftop fights and leaping from one vehicle to another.\nTo represent this, fighters treat vehicles like terrain for the purposes of movement, climbing up the sides and leaping onto them from gantries (though falling and ending up Prone next to a vehicle is a very dangerous position to be in!).\nHowever, trying to balance on the roof of a speeding vehicle is a tricky proposition. Whenever a vehicle moves, any fighters on it, except those on designated transport spaces, must immediately pass an Initiative test or fall. If they fall, place them 1\" away from the vehicle in a direction determined by the Scatter dice after the vehicle has finished moving. If this causes them to land within \u00bd\" of the edge of a platform, they must test again to avoid\u00a0\nfalling\n. If it would cause them to hit impassable terrain, move them the shortest distance so as to be able to be placed. They only need to test once during each vehicle\u2019s activation, though they will also have to test if the vehicle they are on is moved as part of a collision.\nNote that objects such as Loot caskets will automatically fall off a vehicle if not placed in a designated transport area, unless they are in base contact with a fighter which passes its Initiative test.\nOBSTACLES\n\nObstacles are any free standing terrain features measuring no more than 2\" high and no more than 2\" across, such as barricades, barrels and pipelines. Fighters may cross obstacles as they move, but doing so reduces their movement by a number of inches equal to the height of the obstacle. A fighter may not end their movement on top of an obstacle.\nVehicles may cross obstacles as they move, and in doing so will destroy the obstacle and cause it to be removed from the battlefield. However, when moving across an obstacle in this way, a vehicle may take damage, see\u00a0\nColliding with Terrain\n.\nSTRUCTURES (STURDY & FLIMSY)\n\nStructures are any terrain features measuring more than 2\" high or more than 2\" across, be they free standing or connected to other terrain features in some way.",

Fighters may climb up and onto structures and between the various levels and platforms of a structure as they move, and may end their movement on any level of a structure if there is sufficient space for their base (see Climbing later).\nVehicles may suffer damage when colliding with a structure, and if flimsy the structure will be destroyed (see\u00a0\nColliding with Terrain\n).\nIMPASSABLE TERRAIN & SOLID TERRAIN FEATURES\n\nAs mentioned previously, any terrain can be designated impassable when setting up the battlefield, regardless of size. Impassable terrain may include solid sections of walls, vertiginous towers or towering vats of molten metal. Models may not move across impassable terrain.\nDuctways:\n\u00a0Ductways are only present during Zone Mortalis battles and can be represented either by a marker placed on or next to a wall, or by a scenic ductway opening modelled onto the wall itself. Note, however, that such a feature must be present on both sides of the wall!\nA ductway can be up to a maximum of 2\" in length and can be placed across any 2\" wide wall or any other terrain features that would otherwise be impassable. Their presence creates an exception to the rule that fighters may not move across impassable terrain and allows fighters to crawl through a narrow duct and traverse the terrain feature by using the Crawl Through Ductway (Double) action.\nCLIMBING\n\nFighters can climb up or down any vertical surface to reach a higher level or platform of a structure during their movement. Vehicles or models with the Mounted condition may not climb. For every 1\" a fighter moves vertically by climbing, they count as having moved 2\".\nA fighter cannot end their activation mid-climb; they must have sufficient movement to reach a flat surface. If they cannot, they will stay where they were when the action was declared. Players should note that a fighter may end a Move (Simple) action mid-climb, provided that they are able to immediately use another action to complete the climb.\nStepping Up:\n\u00a0Whilst moving, a fighter may freely \u2018step up\u2019 onto another level or platform of a structure, provided that it is no more than \u00bd\" higher than the level they are currently on. If the difference in height is more than \u00bd\", they must climb as described previously.\nOverhangs:\n\u00a0When climbing, a fighter can traverse an overhang as long as it protrudes no more than 1\" from the vertical surface. Overhangs that protrude more than 1\" are considered impassable to a climbing fighter.\nLadders & Stairs:\n\u00a0When climbing a ladder or stairs between the levels of a structure, there are no modifiers to a fighter\u2019s movement.\nLEAPING GAPS\n\nA moving fighter may attempt to leap across any gap that is bigger than their base, provided that they have enough Movement to do so. The fighter stops at the edge and makes an Initiative test. If they pass, they leap the gap and may continue moving. If they fail, they will fall straight down by the shortest possible route to the next level down and will suffer a hit as described in\u00a0\nResolving Hits: Falling\n.\nJUMPING DOWN\n\nA fighter may attempt to jump down to a level below or to Disembark from a vehicle. They must pass an Initiative test with no modifier for the first 2\" jumped, but with a cumulative -1 modifier for every additional 2\" jumped (rounded up). If the test is failed, they fall and may suffer a hit as described in\u00a0\nResolving Hits: Falling\n.\nStepping Down:\n\u00a0Whilst moving, a fighter may freely \u2018step down\u2019 onto another level or platform of a structure, provided that it is no more than \u00bd\" lower than the level they are currently on.",

        "fcdd1fbf-f317-4573-b7fa-ca2217fa33ac": "VEHICLE IMPACTS\nSource: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)\nThere are several ways in which vehicles can impact other models, and even terrain. What happens when they do depends upon the nature of the impact.\nRUNNING OVER FIGHTERS\n\nIf a moving vehicle comes into contact with a fighter\u2019s base, the fighter is moved by the smallest amount possible to allow the vehicle to pass, ensuring the fighter does not end up within 1\" of the vehicle. Once the vehicle\u2019s movement has been completed, make an Initiative test for each Standing or Prone and Pinned fighter moved in this way, applying a +1 modifier if the fighter was Standing. If the fighter is Prone and Seriously Injured, they will only pass this test on a natural roll of a 6.\nIf this test is passed, the fighter was able to dodge safely aside. If, however, this test is failed, the fighter suffers an automatic hit, and if Standing and Active becomes Prone and Pinned. See the Vehicle Collision Damage table to determine the power of the hit.\nVEHICLE COLLISION DAMAGE TABLE\n\nThere are many circumstances when a vehicle might collide with another part of the battlefield, be it another vehicle, a fighter or terrain. When this happens use the Movement characteristic of the moving vehicle on the table below to determine the Strength, AP and Damage of the impact.\nA vehicle that is Stationary and Stalled but has moved as part of a Jump Start, Turn-over, Free Wheel action or as a result of suffering a vehicle collision is assumed to have a Movement characteristic of 3\".\n\n\n\n\n\nVEHICLE COLLISIONS\n\nThere are two types of vehicle collisions: head-on and side-on:\nHEAD-ON COLLISIONS\n\nIf, during the course of its movement, a vehicle\u2019s Front arc makes contact with any part of another vehicle, a head-on collision has occurred. When this happens, compare the Toughness value of the impact arcs of the two vehicles:\nIf the Toughness of both vehicles is the same, or if the Toughness of the moving vehicle is greater, the impacted vehicle is pushed by the moving vehicle until it reaches the end of its movement.\nIf the Toughness of the moving vehicle is lower, the active vehicle stops immediately.\nSIDE-ON COLLISIONS\n\nIf, during the course of its movement, a vehicle\u2019s Side arc makes contact with any part of another vehicle, a side-on collision has occurred (generally this will be either as the result of a failed Loss of Control test or a vehicle turning). When this happens, make a Handling test for the moving vehicle, applying a +1 modifier if its Toughness in the impact arc is greater than that of the other vehicle:\nIf the test is passed, the impacted vehicle is moved by the smallest amount possible to allow the active vehicle to pass.\nIf this test is failed, the active vehicle is turned by the smallest amount possible to allow it to continue moving.\nCOLLIDING WITH TERRAIN\n\nIf a vehicle collides with a wall, an impassable or solid terrain feature or a sturdy structure, it will likely come off worse. In such cases, the vehicle is automatically treated as if it had collided with a vehicle that has a greater Toughness than it, whilst the terrain will suffer no damage.\nIf a vehicle collides with an obstacle or a flimsy structure, that terrain feature will be destroyed and is removed from the battlefield. Any fighters on top of it immediately fall. The vehicle itself is treated as having collided with a vehicle that has a lower Toughness than it.\nVEHICLE COLLISION DAMAGE\n\nIn either case, once the active vehicle has finished its movement, both vehicles will suffer an automatic hit. The Strength, AP and Damage of this hit is determined by the\u00a0\nVehicle Collision Damage table\n. All hits are resolved against the Toughness value of the facing that suffers the hit.\nIf the Toughness of one of the vehicles is lower, increase the Strength, AP and Damage of the hit against it by 1. Applying damage to vehicles is discussed later (see\u00a0\nResolving Hits Against Vehicles\n).\nINFO\nCHAIN COLLISIONS\n\nIt is possible (some might even say likely!) that a chain reaction of collisions may occur as vehicles push each other into rocky outcrops and other battlefield features.\nWhen this happens, fully resolve the damage from each collision in the order they occur. If a subsequent collision occurs due to a vehicle being pushed, use the initial vehicle\u2019s Movement characteristic when determining the power of the impact.\nFinally, if a vehicle stops due to impacting impassable terrain or a vehicle with a higher Toughness value then all the vehicles involved in the collision stop.",

Sometimes, a model may even be moved involuntarily as a result of an enemy attack or an in-game effect. This section deals with how models are moved around the tabletop and how terrain can hinder their progress.\nMOVING MODELS\n\nAll models, be they fighters or vehicles, move by performing actions. For example, a fighter might perform a Move (Simple) action to advance cautiously, or may perform two Move (Simple) actions in quick succession to run forward and cover a lot more ground. A fighter might Charge (Double) to get into combat, or Crawl (Double) to get out of the firing line.\nA model is not obliged to move its full Movement allowance, it can move any distance up to its Movement allowance, but it cannot move further. A fighter need not move in a straight line, vehicles however are more restricted; a fighter can zigzag around terrain as appropriate (though note that a Charge (Double) action should take the shortest route possible), whereas a vehicle can make a number of turns based upon the action being performed. After moving, a fighter can turn to face any direction, whereas a vehicle\u2019s facing will be determined by the action it performed.\nAll actions that include movement must be declared before any measuring is carried out. Sometimes, after a model\u2019s declared movement is measured, it may become obvious that it does not have as much movement as hoped and will end its movement short of where the controlling player had planned. In this case, move the model as far as possible in the desired direction, and try to make good use of any available cover!\nNote that, in the case of a fighter performing a Charge (Double) action, if the fighter has insufficient movement to make it into base to base contact with an enemy fighter, they must still move the full distance (stopping 1\" away, as follows) and may often end their movement in a very dangerous position!\nYAQ\nFighters can move (voluntarily) through friendly fighters (if having sufficient movement to not overlap any bases).\nTHE 1\" RULE\n\nFighters cannot move to within 1\" of an enemy fighter during their activation, unless that enemy fighter is Prone and Seriously Injured. Vehicles suffer no such restriction and can move to within 1\" of any enemy model during their activation, as described on the opposite page.\nThe only exception to this rule is when a Standing and Active fighter performs a Charge (Double) action, in which case they may move to within 1\" of one or more enemy fighters, provided that they end their movement in base to base contact with one or more enemy fighters. If a fighter performing a Charge (Double) action has sufficient movement to get within 1\" of an enemy fighter but does not have sufficient movement to make it into base to base contact with the enemy fighter, they must stop moving 1\" away.\nIt may occur that a fighter is moved involuntarily to within 1\" of an enemy model. For example, a fighter with the\u00a0\nHurl\n\u00a0skill may throw an enemy fighter that they are engaged with, which may result in that fighter coming into contact with other fighters, friendly or enemy. Should this happen, the normal rules described previously are temporarily suspended until the movement and any other effects it causes have been fully resolved (such as in the previous Hurl example, in which case the fighters would suffer hits as a result of being thrown into contact with one another). Once they have been, move the model that was involuntarily moved by the shortest route possible until it is 1\" away from the enemy model.\nDIRECTLY TOWARDS & DIRECTLY AWAY FROM\n\nSometimes, the rules will say that a model needs to move directly towards another model. To do this, trace an imaginary straight line that crosses through the centre of each model \u2013 the moving model then moves towards the other along this line the required distance. Similarly, to move directly away from another model, follow the same method but move the moving model away.\nAs always, this cannot make a model move through a solid terrain feature. Should a model contact a solid terrain feature, it stops and does not move further\nVEHICLES AND DIFFICULT TERRAIN\n\nHow a vehicle interacts with difficult terrain depends upon how the vehicle moves. This will be indicated in the vehicle\u2019s rules, normally based on their type of Locomotion.\nLOCOMOTION SPECIAL RULES\n\nAll vehicles must have a Locomotion special rule \u2013 this dictates how they interact with terrain. The four Locomotive special rules are Skimmer, Tracked, Walker and Wheeled.",

If ending an activation on difficult or dangerous terrain, pass a Handling test or suffer a Catastrophic hit to the Drive.\nWALKER\n\nMake any amount of turns during an activation.\nFor every 1\" a walker moves through difficult terrain, it counts as having moved 2\".\nVEHICLES AND DANGEROUS TERRAIN\n\nA vehicle may cross dangerous terrain in the same way as difficult terrain. However to safely do so, a vehicle must also pass a Handling check. If this check is passed, the vehicle crosses the terrain safely. If it fails, a vehicle will suffer an immediate\u00a0\nCatastrophic Hit to its Drive\n.\nFIGHTER MOVEMENT ON VEHICLES\n\nIn the ash wastes, gang members scramble over vehicles as they race along, engaging in rooftop fights and leaping from one vehicle to another.\nTo represent this, fighters treat vehicles like terrain for the purposes of movement, climbing up the sides and leaping onto them from gantries (though falling and ending up Prone next to a vehicle is a very dangerous position to be in).\nHowever, trying to balance on the roof of a speeding vehicle is a tricky proposition. Whenever a vehicle moves, any fighters on it, except those on designated transport spaces, must immediately pass an Initiative check or fall. If they fall, place them 1\" away from the vehicle in a direction determined by the Scatter dice after the vehicle has finished moving. If this causes them to land within \u00bd\" of the edge of a platform, they must test again to avoid falling. If it would cause them to hit impassable terrain, move them the shortest distance so as to be able to be placed. They only need to test once during each vehicle\u2019s activation, though will also have to test if the vehicle they are on is moved as part of a collision.\nNote that objects such as Loot caskets will automatically fall off a vehicle if not placed in a designated transport area, unless it is in base contact with a fighter which passes its Initiative check.\nLast updated\u00a0on",

This list is by no means exhaustive, however, with skills, scenarios, special terrain features and more introducing further actions that vehicles may perform. As with fighters, vehicles may perform two actions during their activation.\nMOBILE VEHICLES\n\nMobile vehicles can perform a wide range of actions.\nMOVE (SIMPLE)\n\nThe vehicle may do all of the following:\nMove in a straight line directly forwards a distance up to its Movement characteristic.\nMake a single pivot around its centre of up to 90\u00b0 at any point before, during or after its move.\nCross any gap between two platforms that is no wider than the length of the vehicle as long as the initial platform isn\u2019t lower than the target platform (if they try to cross a bigger gap, they will\u00a0\nfall\n).\nCross certain terrain features \u2013 see\u00a0\nVehicles and Difficult Terrain\n.\nMANOEUVRE (SIMPLE)\n\nThe vehicle may do all of the following:\nMove in a straight line directly forwards or backwards a distance up to half its Movement characteristic.\nMake any number of pivots around its centre at any point before, during or after its move.\nCross certain terrain features \u2013 see\u00a0\nVehicles and Difficult Terrain\n.\nMOVE & SHOOT (BASIC)\n\nThe vehicle may move as if making a Move (Simple) action, halving its Movement characteristic. At any point before, during or after its move, the vehicle makes a ranged attack with either one weapon that has the Crew Operated trait or a sidearm. A vehicle cannot perform both this and the Fire All (Basic) action in the same activation.\nFIRE ALL (BASIC)\n\nThe vehicle may make one ranged attack with each weapon that has the Crew Operated trait. A vehicle cannot perform both this and the Move & Shoot action in the same activation.\nRELOAD (SIMPLE)\n\nPick a weapon on this vehicle with the Crew Operated trait or a weapon the crew is equipped with that is Out of Ammo and make an Ammo test. If the test is passed, the weapon is reloaded and the Out of Ammo marker is removed.\nAIM (BASIC)\n\nIf the vehicle makes a subsequent Fire All (Basic) action this activation, apply a +1 modifier to any Hit rolls they make.\nDRIFT (BASIC)\n\nThe vehicle may move up to half its Movement characteristic in a straight line anywhere in its Side arc. Once it has finished the move, make a\u00a0\nLoss of Control test\n\u00a0applying a +1 modifier.\nRAM (DOUBLE)\n\nThe vehicle moves as if making a Move (Simple) action, adding D6\" to the distance it can move. If, during this movement, it has a headon collision with another vehicle or a terrain feature, this vehicle halves its Movement characteristic when working out the Strength, AP and damage of the hit it suffers \u2013 the impacted vehicle suffers a hit as normal. After the collision has been resolved, the vehicle\u2019s activation ends.\nSPIN (BASIC)\n\nThe vehicle may move as if performing a Move (Simple) action but may turn up to 180\u00b0 instead of 90\u00b0. Immediately after completing the turn, take a\u00a0\nLoss of Control test\n.\nFULL THROTTLE (DOUBLE)\n\nThe vehicle moves as if making a Move (Simple) action, but may move up to three times its Movement characteristic. If it makes a turn at any point during this move then immediately make a\u00a0\nLoss of Control test\n\u00a0with a -1 modifier.\nSTATIONARY VEHICLES\n\nStationary vehicles can perform only a limited number of actions. What these are depends upon their Secondary Status: Stalled or Wrecked.\nSTATIONARY & STALLED VEHICLES\n\nVehicles that are Stationary and Stalled are able to perform any of the following actions:\nJUMP START (SIMPLE)\n\nThe driver frantically tries to restart their vehicle. Make a Handling test for the vehicle, applying a +1 modifier unless the vehicle only has 1 HP remaining:\nIf the Handling test is passed, the vehicle immediately restarts, changing its status to Mobile.\nIf the Handling test is failed, the vehicle refuses to restart and it remains Stationary and Stalled.\nTURN-OVER (BASIC)\n\nWhilst trying to restart the vehicle, the engine turns over briefly, allowing the vehicle to move in small bounds. The vehicle moves as if making a Move (Simple) action, but may only move D3\". Additionally, apply a +1 modifier to the next test to Restart the vehicle.\nFREE WHEEL (BASIC)\n\nThe driver releases the brakes, letting gravity pull the vehicle.",

Roll a D6:\nOn a 1-3, the vehicle moves forwards.\nOn a 4-6, the vehicle moves backwards.\nIf the vehicle collides with another vehicle or a terrain feature during this move, it stops automatically and collision damage is worked out as normal.\nFIRE ALL (BASIC)\n\n(See previous Fire All entry).\nSTATIONARY & WRECKED VEHICLES\n\nVehicles that are Stationary and Wrecked no longer participate in the battle. The crew will have gone Out of Action and fighters on board might have been\u00a0\nthrown clear\n, and the vehicle itself has been reduced to a terrain feature. Therefore, a Stationary and Wrecked vehicle is not given a Ready marker during the Ready Gang step of the Priority phase, is not activated during the Action phase, and is unable to perform any actions.\nBROKEN VEHICLES\n\nVehicles can be subject to the\u00a0\nBroken Condition\n. A Broken vehicle is one that has lost its nerve; its crew wants nothing more than to get to a safe place where they can regain their composure.\nWhen activated, if Mobile, any vehicle subject to the Broken Condition must perform the Break for Air (Double) action; if Stationary it must perform the Burn Out (Double) action. Its activation then immediately ends.\nBREAK FOR AIR (DOUBLE)\n\nDesperate to escape the chaos of battle and get some air, the vehicle moves as if making a Move (Simple) action but moves 3D6\" with no limit to the number of pivots it can make.\nWhen a Broken vehicle moves, it must attempt to end its move, in order of priority:\nSo that it is more than 3\" away from enemy models.\nSo that it is out of line of sight of enemy models.\nIn partial or full cover.\nAs far away from any enemy models as possible.\nBURN OUT (DOUBLE)\n\nPanicked, the vehicle\u2019s crew try to restart the vehicle in order to escape. However, repeated attempts to restart it cause thick clouds of smoke and ash to billow from its exhausts and wheels. Place D3 markers anywhere within 1\" of the vehicle, each of these markers is subject to the Smoke weapon trait.\nIn the End phase of any round in which this action was performed, the vehicle will suffer a -1 modifier to its Restart test for each Smoke marker placed.",

        "e6823a59-ff59-4d99-bc52-b5309ddd18ff": "TYPES OF ACTION\nSource: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)\nThe following section covers the types of actions models can perform when activated. The actions available to a model differ depending on whether it is a fighter or a vehicle.\nPlayers should take note that whilst the actions a model can perform are based upon their current Status and Secondary Status, performing an action can and will, in many cases, change either their Status, their Secondary Status, or both.\nThere are four types of action a model may perform when activated:\nSIMPLE ACTION\n\nA model can perform the same Simple action more than once during its activation. Each time a Simple action is repeated during an activation, it uses up one action. For example, a Standing and Active fighter may perform two Move (Simple) actions, using both of their actions but allowing them to move twice. If an active model\u2019s first action is a Simple action, it may fully resolve it before declaring its second action.\nINFO\nCHANGING FACING\n\nFighters can change their facing during their activation, representing them turning in place, or turning their head from side to side. When a Standing fighter is activated, they may turn to face any direction their controlling player wishes, before making either of their actions. Changing facing in this way does not count as moving, and therefore can be combined with any other action.\nPlayers should note, however, that a fighter that changes their facing when Standing and Engaged will normally suffer negative modifiers to any Hit rolls they make. This represents the fighter turning quickly to confront an attacker.\nProne fighters, as has been mentioned previously, have no facing. When they stand up, the controlling player can choose in which direction they face.\nBASIC ACTIONS\n\nA Basic action can only be performed once per model activation. If an activated model\u2019s first action is a Basic action, it may fully resolve it before declaring its second action.\nDOUBLE ACTIONS\n\nPerforming a Double action counts as making two actions. For example, if a Mobile vehicle makes a Ram(Double) action, it will have used both of its actions and cannot perform another during this activation. If a model can only perform one action during its activation for any reason, it may not perform a Double action.\nFREE ACTIONS\n\nPerforming a Free action does not count as using one of your actions. Each Free action can only be performed once per activation. A model may not perform a Free action with the same name as a Basic action that they have performed this activation and vice versa.\nCHANGING ACTION TYPE\n\nSome effects may change an action\u2019s type; for example, the Unwieldy trait changes the Shoot (Basic) action to a Shoot (Double) action. Unless stated otherwise, any effect that applies to an action applies regardless of the action type (i.e., if a gang tactic is triggered by a Shoot (Basic) action it will also be triggered by a Shoot (Double) or a Shoot (Simple) action).\nLast updated\u00a0on",

ACTIVATE GANG\n\nThe bulk of a game of Necromunda takes place during the Action phase. The Action phase consists of play alternating back and forth between the players, activating individual models one at a time, or small groups of fighters as part of a \u2018Group Activation\u2019 (as follows).\nWhen it is a player\u2019s turn, they choose one of the models within their gang that is Ready and perform a number of actions with it. This is referred to as \u2018activating\u2019 the model. The number of actions a model can perform depends upon its type:\nWhen activated, a model may perform up to two actions, depending upon the type of actions it chooses to perform.\nSometimes a model may only be able to perform one action when activated. In such cases, the types of action it can choose to perform are limited to Simple, Basic and Free (see\u00a0\nTypes of Action\n).\nSometimes a model may be able to perform additional actions when activated. In such cases, the rules will specify either the type of action or a specific action.\nThe actions a Ready model can perform are governed by its current Status and Secondary Status. Players should note that certain Conditions will also limit the actions a model may make, most notably Broken. For example, a fighter subject to the Broken condition may only make a Running for Cover (Double) action when activated, regardless of Status or Secondary Status.\nIf one player runs out of models to activate, the other player can activate all of their remaining models in an order of their choosing. Once all models have been activated, even if they performed no actions during their activation, the Action phase ends.\nGROUP ACTIVATIONS\n\nSome fighters, most notably Leaders and Champions, have a special rule called \u2018Group Activation (X)\u2019 listed on their profile. In all such cases, the \u2018X\u2019 in brackets will be replaced by a number (usually 1 or 2). When a player activates such a fighter, they can choose to use this special rule, allowing them to activate additional Ready fighters at the same time as the fighter (note that only fighters can be activated as part of a group activation, vehicles cannot):\nGroup Activation (X):\n\u00a0When a fighter with this special rule is activated, their controlling player can choose to activate a number of additional Ready friendly fighters equal to the number shown in brackets that are within 3\" of this fighter as part of a \u2018Group Activation\u2019:\nThe controlling player must nominate all of the fighters who will be activated in this way before any of them are activated.\nOnce all participants of the Group Activation have been nominated, the controlling player selects one and activates them as normal, fully resolving their activation before selecting and activating the next. Each fighter activates individually; groups do not activate simultaneously.\nAdditional fighters with this special rule activated in this way may not themselves use this special rule during this activation.\nLast updated\u00a0on",

Ready Gang: Both players give each of their fighters and vehicles a Ready marker.\n1. ROLL FOR PRIORITY\n\nThis step determines which player wins the Priority marker for this round. The Priority marker is a coin or token, such as that contained in the Necromunda: Hive War boxed set, that is held by the player with Priority for the round, acting as a reminder. Holding the Priority marker gives a player a huge advantage, as they are able to activate first and can dictate the flow of the action during the round, often putting their opponent onto the back foot and making their gang behave reactively rather than proactively in response to their foes moving and attacking first.\nTo determine who has Priority, each player rolls a D6, and the player who rolls the highest takes Priority for this round. In the case of a tie, the player who had Priority in the previous round passes it to their opponent. If the first Priority roll of the battle is tied, neither player will have held Priority previously, therefore both players roll again.\nINFO\nPRIORITY IN MULTI-PLAYER GAMES\n\nSometimes, more than two gangs find themselves fighting on the same battlefield \u2013 either allying together to take out hated foes, or in a bloody free-for-all.\nPlayers roll for Priority as normal, but ties are handled differently. Players determine play order based on their dice score when rolling for Priority. Any ties are re-rolled (for example, if four players roll for Priority and score a 5, 4, 4 and 2, the player that rolled 5 has Priority, the player that rolled 2 goes last and the players that each rolled a 4 roll off again to determine who is going second and third).\n2. READY GANG\n\nDuring this step of the Priority phase, both players place a Ready marker on each model (both fighters and vehicles) in their gang that is currently on the battlefield, note that some Conditions and Statuses may prevent a model gaining a Ready marker. The Necromunda: Hive War boxed set contains a number of Ready markers that can be used for this. Ready markers should be placed either on the model\u2019s Fighter card or Vehicle card or next to the model itself on the battlefield.\nOnce a model has been activated, its Ready marker is removed. Under normal circumstances, a model that is no longer Ready may not activate again, but players should take note that there are some instances in which a model may activate again, notably in the case of some skills and gang tactics.\nLast updated\u00a0on",

        "8ee964c6-10c6-4ac8-8341-b6bd3d8c0bd2": "THE PRE-BATTLE SEQUENCE\nSource: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)\nPrior to any battle, there are several important steps that need to take place, as listed below. Some of these only apply during Campaign play, and can therefore be skipped during Skirmish play, as mentioned in the appropriate entries. Whatever the case, this sequence must be followed in the order shown, and must be done while both players are present.\nThe pre-battle sequence consists of the following steps:\nMake a Challenge & Stake Territory\nRecruit Hired Guns\nDetermine Scenario\nSet up the Battlefield\nChoose Crews\nAnnounce Territory Boons\nGang Tactics\nDeployment\n1. MAKE A CHALLENGE & STAKE TERRITORY\n\nFor a battle to be fought, a challenge must be issued and accepted. In Campaign play, challenges are handled as described by the Arbitrator, though campaigns will provide guidance. In Skirmish play, a challenge is issued and accepted when two players decide to play a battle.\nIn Campaign play, an eligible Territory is nominated as the stake for the battle (as described in each campaign). This may be an as yet unclaimed Territory or a Territory controlled by one of the players that their opponent wishes to seize control of \u2013 each campaign will specify.\n2. RECRUIT HIRED GUNS\n\nPlayers can spend credits to recruit Hired Guns. In Campaign play, the gang may spend credits from those it has in its Stash. In Skirmish play, any unspent credits left over from creating the gang can be spent to recruit Hired Guns. Additionally, in Campaign play, gangs may be able to recruit Hired Guns through other means, such as House favours or as Boons granted by Territories.\nIf both players wish to recruit Hired Guns, the player with the lower Gang Rating may do so first.\n3. DETERMINE SCENARIO\n\nIn Skirmish play, players may simply choose a scenario they wish to play. If they cannot decide, they should roll off to see who decides which scenario is played. In Campaign play, the scenario may be determined by the Arbitrator, though many campaigns include their own Scenario table.\nDETERMINING THE ATTACKER & DEFENDER\n\nMany scenarios state that one gang is the attacker and the other the defender. In Campaign play, the player who issued the challenge is the attacker. In Skirmish play, both players should roll a D6, with the player who rolls the highest choosing who is the attacker and who is the defender.\nHOME TURF ADVANTAGE\n\nThe scenario being played may indicate that the defender benefits from the\u00a0\nHome Turf Advantage\n, representing the gang fighting furiously to defend their valuable turf from attackers. A gang fighting with the Home Turf Advantage is far less likely to bottle out and in some cases will fight ferociously until the last.\nRESCUE MISSION\n\nIn Campaign play, it is not uncommon for fighters to be taken\u00a0\nCaptive by rival gangs\n. If one player has Captured a fighter belonging to a rival gang, the player that controls the gang the Captive belongs to may issue a challenge to play the Rescue Mission scenario. If the challenge is accepted, then the Rescue Mission scenario is automatically used for the battle. If the player holding the Captive refuses the challenge, they automatically forfeit the Captive. No Territory is staked on this battle; the Captive is effectively the stake.\n4. SET UP THE BATTLEFIELD\n\nThe players now set up the battlefield. Some scenarios have special instructions for terrain. The default methods are detailed in full in\u00a0\nBattlefield Set-up\n.\n5. CHOOSE CREWS\n\nAfter the battlefield has been set up, before gangs can be deployed, players must select their starting crews for the battle ahead. The scenario being played will detail the method of selection to be used, how many and what kind of models can be selected. The selection methods are explained in full in\u00a0\nChoosing Crews\n.\n6. ANNOUNCE TERRITORY BOONS\n\nIn Campaign play, many of the territories grant a \u2018Boon\u2019 to the gang that controls them, and many of these Boons will have an effect during a battle. Players should announce which, if any, of their Territory Boons grant them a bonus that will have an effect on the upcoming battle at this stage, forewarning their opponent. If a Territory Boon is not announced, it cannot be used during this battle.\nIn Skirmish play, this step of the pre-battle sequence can be ignored.\n7.",

DEPLOYMENT\n\nThe final step of the pre-battle sequence is deployment, in which the players set their gangs up on the battlefield, ready for the battle ahead.

        "9124676c-a1c5-4e22-9120-7b8b98eff2df": "THE GANG ROSTER\nAs well as filling in a Fighter card or Vehicle card for each fighter and vehicle in their gang, players will need to complete a gang roster. This tracks additional information during Campaign play, such as Territories held, Gang Rating, Reputation, Wealth and so on, as well as each model\u2019s Experience and Advancements. During Skirmish play, such information is of less importance, but a gang roster is still a useful tool.\nCOMPLETING A GANG ROSTER\n\nThe gang roster is made up of a number of elements, as shown opposite. Many of these elements are explained over the following pages. Those that are not are dealt with in detail in the\u00a0\ncampaign rules\n. These elements include the gang\u2019s name (1) and Type (2), its Gang Rating (3), Reputation (4) and Wealth (5), the Territories it holds (6) and its Stash (7), containing unspent credits, surplus equipment (both weapons and Wargear), and so on.\nThe gang roster also has a line for each model in the gang, with space for their names (8), fighter or vehicle type (9), cost (10), Experience earned (11), the number of Advancements gained (12), and whether they are currently In Recovery or Repair (13) or have suffered any Lasting Injuries, Lasting Damage or been Captured (14).\nNote that although the number of rows is limited, there is no upper limit on the number of fighters or vehicles a gang can contain. Should a gang be lucky enough to have more fighters or vehicles than can be fitted onto one gang roster, simply use a second gang roster for extra space.\nGANG ATTRIBUTES\n\nIn Campaign play, gangs have a number of attributes, which are tracked on their roster. These attributes, and their starting values, are explained below:\nGANG RATING\n\nThe Gang Rating is an indicator of how powerful the gang is \u2013 the proficiency of its models, how well equipped it is, and so on. The Gang Rating is the total cost of all of the fighters and vehicles in the gang, including the cost of all the equipment and Upgrades they are equipped with.\nWEALTH\n\nIn Campaign play, gangs also have a Wealth value \u2013 this is equal to the total cost of all of the fighters and vehicles in the gang, plus the value of any credits or equipment they have in their Stash.\nREPUTATION\n\nReputation is the measure of a gang\u2019s standing and power in their region of the underhive. It is separate from Gang Rating, which is a measure of the gang\u2019s size and resources; a small gang can build up quite an impressive reputation. A gang\u2019s Reputation starts at 1, and cannot drop below 1.\nMODEL CAMPAIGN ATTRIBUTES\n\nIn Campaign play, each model in a gang has a number of attributes that are tracked in their entry on the gang\u2019s roster:\nEXPERIENCE (XP)\n\nModels can spend Experience in order to purchase Advancements \u2013 when they do so, their Experience total is reduced accordingly.\nADVANCEMENTS\n\nThe more Advancements a model has, the more expensive any future Advancements will be. In the case of models that start with an Advancement (such as a free skill), this should be noted on the gang roster, though in most cases this will not increase the expense of future Advancements.\nCAPTURED BY, IN RECOVERY & IN REPAIR\n\nWhen a fighter goes Out of Action during a battle fought as part of a campaign, there is a chance that they will suffer a\u00a0\nLasting Injury\n. Many of these will cause them to go Into Recovery and miss the next battle. When this is the case, their In Recovery box is ticked.\nSimilarly, during Campaign play fighters might be\u00a0\nCaptured by an enemy gang\n\u00a0\u2013 while this is the case, a note is made in the Lasting Injury/Captured By box of the name of the gang that has Captured them.\nShould a vehicle be Wrecked during a battle fought as part of a campaign, there is a chance that it will suffer\u00a0\nLasting Damage\n. This may cause it to go Into Repair and force both it and its crew to miss the next battle. When this is the case, the vehicle\u2019s In Repair box is ticked.\n\nLast updated\u00a0on",
        "b3b42992-cb7c-481e-8392-286694fde4d0": "CREATING A SKIRMISH GANG\nThis section deals with how to create a gang for a Skirmish battle. For the most part, this is exactly the same as creating a gang for a campaign, right down to using the gang lists found in various Necromunda supplements. However, there are some distinct differences to be aware of.\nFOUNDING A GANG\n\nFor stand-alone Skirmish battles, gangs should be between 1,250 and 2,000 credits. Larger is possible, but it is worth bearing in mind that smaller credit limits force hard choices to be made. Sometimes, having to choose whether to include one thing or the other is better than having both, as it adds to the challenge of the experience. It may be the case that a minimum and/or maximum number of fighters or vehicles should be specified. A good rule to follow here is that gangs must be a minimum of ten fighters and one vehicle, and a maximum of twenty fighters and four vehicles, and that a gang must contain ten models before Hangers-on, Brutes or Hired Guns can be added.\nAs in a campaign, a blank Fighter card or Vehicle card must be filled in for each member of the gang and for any Hangers-on, Brutes and Hired Guns, and all fighters, vehicles, Hired Guns, Brutes and Hangers-on must be represented by an appropriate model. Finally, all of the normal rules regarding gang composition must be followed, as described in\u00a0\nGang Composition\n.\nCredits not spent when a Skirmish gang is founded are not added to a gang\u2019s Stash, they are simply lost and not added to its Wealth.\nLeaders and Champions:\n\u00a0As normal, the Leader and Champions should gain a free starting skill when founding the gang (or an ability, depending upon the gang being used) and, as always, this extra skill should be noted on the fighter\u2019s Fighter card.\nEquipment:\n\u00a0Gangs should be equipped following the usual rules with regard to weapon types and total number of weapons available to a model of each type. Additionally, gangs may be allowed to purchase rare and/or illegal items from the Trading Post, in effect building a Stash of rare items that can then be given to the models they are hiring when founding the gang, provided, of course, that they follow the normal rules with regards to how individual models can be equipped.\nA Rare (X) and Illegal (X) level should be determined beforehand. For example, players may be allowed to select items up to Rare (10) but not above.\nHired Guns, Brutes and Hangers-on:\n\u00a0In Skirmish battles, if there is a minimum number of fighters required, Hired Guns, Hangers-on and Brutes will not count towards this. For example, if gangs must contain a minimum of ten fighters, they must contain ten fighters drawn from the gang list before any Hired Guns, Hangers-on or Brutes can be included. They will however count towards the maximum number of fighters if a maximum is in effect.\nThe number of Hangers-on and Brutes that can be hired when a Skirmish gang is founded is covered in more detail in the Reputation section that follows. Any Hangers-on and Brutes included in a gang must be represented by appropriate models, even those that may not spend much time on the table.\nGANG ATTRIBUTES\n\nIn a standalone Skirmish battle, Gang Attributes work differently. Gang Rating, for instance, is predetermined and will not fluctuate.\nReputation:\n\u00a0For Skirmish battles, rather than starting with the usual 1 Reputation, gangs may be given a Reputation of 5, 10, or 15 when founded. Players should decide before the battle how much Reputation their gangs will have.\nThe Reputation of Skirmish gangs serves to determine how many Hangers-on and Brutes can be included when the gang is founded.\nMODEL ATTRIBUTES\n\nDuring stand-alone Skirmish battles, models do not gain Experience, so there is no obvious way for them to gain Advancements the way their counterparts in a campaign will. The following section deals with how to add extra skills and characteristic increases to fighters within a Skirmish gang.\nAdditional Skills:\n\u00a0In Skirmish battles, it is a good idea to allow certain fighters to start with some free additional skills as well as the free starting skills given to the Leader and any Champions. This works well with the increased credits players have to found a gang and the access to Rare Trade items and Hangers-on to create the feel of an established, veteran gang that can be used in a stand-alone battle.\nThere are many ways to do this, and players should feel free to experiment, but as a general rule it is recommended that gangs be allowed to choose a number of additional free skills as follows based on the credits value of the gang:",
        "21e1638f-5170-418e-98b0-ab237cbeca6c": "Skills should be distributed amongst Leaders, Champions, Prospects and Juves. Skills may also be allocated to Gangers or Crew who are nominated as Specialists. The number of Specialists included should be decided beforehand by the players.\nThere should, however, be a sensible limit on the number of skills each model can take. As a good rule of thumb, models should be allowed a number of skills based on their type as follows:\nLeader:\n\u00a0One free starting skill and up to two additional skills\nChampions:\n\u00a0One free starting skill and up to one additional skill.\nProspects, Juves and Specialists:\n\u00a0One additional skill.\nCharacteristic Increases:\n\u00a0In addition to extra skills, gangs should be allowed a number of free characteristic increases. Again, there are many ways to do this, and players are encouraged to experiment, but a good rule to follow is that the number of characteristic increases should be half the number of extra skills rounded down, which makes two or three the norm. No model should be allowed more than one characteristic increase. As is usual during Campaign play, characteristic increases may be given to Gangers and Crew as well as Leaders, Champions, Prospects, Juves and Specialists. As with additional skills, these free characteristic increases do not increase Gang Rating.\nLast updated\u00a0on",

Countless billions of wretched souls deal with the bleakness of their existence by cowering from the horrors of the galaxy, dedicating their lives to relentless toil and drudgery in the service of Him on Terra.\nYet there are those who do not. Untold millions of brave or foolish underhive dwellers take up arms, fighting for the fate of humanity in the Emperor\u2019s glorious armies. Many others, in numbers beyond counting, take to a life of violence for their own amusement, violent souls drawn to violent work. Yet more come to their bloody work through desperation, simply hoping to put food in their bellies. Ruthless bounty hunters prowl the underhive, hoping to get rich from their bloody-handed trade. Lowlife scum eke out a meagre existence, hiring out their services to uncaring gang leaders looking for some expendable muscle. Even those who would prefer not to raise arms in violence find themselves drawn into the endless cycle of gang warfare, their skills retained in service of the crew that runs their hab block. The hives of Necromunda are meat grinders for humanity. There is always someone willing to sell their skills to keep the mechanism turning.\nBounty Hunters, House Agents And Hive Scum In Campaign play, gangs have the chance to recruit Hired Guns. These fall into three broad categories: Bounty Hunters, House Agents and Hive Scum, some of which will be named characters, referred to as Dramatis Personae. Such fighters can be hired during the pre-battle sequence, thus securing their services for that one battle. They are not added to the gang roster, but a Fighter card will need to be filled out for them. They can be hired again for subsequent battles \u2013 as such, players might find it useful to keep an appropriate Fighter card, already filled in, for each Hired Gun model they have.\nHired Guns never gain Experience, they cannot purchase Advancements, and they do not suffer Lasting Injuries \u2013 if they go Out of Action, they simply play no further part in the battle.\nIn Skirmish battles, Hired Guns can be purchased in the same way as any other fighter.\nIn either mode of play, a Hired Gun increases the gang\u2019s Rating in the same way as any other fighter.\nOUTLAW HIRED GUNS\n\nFor the most part, in spite of appearances, Bounty Hunters, House Agents, Hive Scum and Dramatis Personae are relatively upright citizens of the underhive who follow Lord Helmawr\u2019s laws as best they can. Therefore, ordinary Hired Guns can only be hired by Law Abiding gangs; they cannot be hired by Outlaw gangs.\nThis does not mean that Outlaw gangs cannot hire Hired Guns. Outlaw gangs may purchase the services of a Hired Gun as normal. If they do however, the fighter must be designated an \u2018Outlaw\u2019 and will gain the Outlaw special rule. Additionally, Outlaw gangs may hire any Dramatis Personae with the Outlaw special rule on their profile.\nLaw Abiding gangs cannot hire Dramatis Personae with the Outlaw rule on their profile and cannot designate a Hive Scum or a Bounty Hunter they have hired as an Outlaw.\nLast updated\u00a0on",

Some gangs\u2019 hideouts become centres of activity, with loyal hivers granted the freedom to come and go as they please, while others are more like fortresses. In either case, they are sought-after destinations for merchants and tradesmen seeking a reliable base of operations and offering their services to the gang.\nHangers-on are primarily used in Campaign play, although some will prove particularly useful in Skirmish play. Brutes are purchased specifically to add some extra muscle and prowess on the battlefield and can be fielded alongside the rest of the gang normally. Either at gang creation or in the Update Roster step of the post-battle sequence, players can recruit Hangers- on and Brutes. These are purchased with credits from the gang\u2019s Stash in the same way as new fighters. A Fighter card is filled out for each and they are added to the gang roster. Most Hangers-on and Brutes have various options for their equipment \u2013 these must be decided when they are recruited and cannot be changed later.\nDuring Campaign play, both Hangers-on and Brutes can be taken captive in the post-battle sequence, just like any other fighter. In such cases, the gang can attempt to rescue them or make a trade with the captor to have them returned. Should they fail to rescue them or secure a trade, the captor may sell them as if they were a normal fighter.\nThe maximum number of Hangers-oFn and Brutes a gang can have is limited by its Reputation, as shown by the table below. If a gang\u2019s Reputation drops to the point that it does not have enough for its Hangers-on or Brutes, it must remove one or more of them from its roster until it is back within the limit. Also, note that there is a limit on each type of Hanger-on and Brute \u2013 a gang can have up to two Rogue Docs, but only one Dome Runner, for example. Hangers-on and Brutes do not count towards the number of fighters in the gang for the purposes of determining how many fighters of other types the gang may contain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHANGERS-ON\n\nEach of the different types of Hanger-on brings a specific benefit or a special rule to the gang that employs them. Hangers-on do not normally take part in battles; their role is a non-combat one. However, should a battle take place on the gang\u2019s own turf (i.e., when the gang has the Home Turf Advantage in a scenario), roll a D6 for each Hanger-on before choosing a crew. On a roll of 1, 2 or 3, the Hanger-on is unfortunate enough to be around when the fighting starts, and must be included as part of the crew.\nHangers-on cannot gain Experience or Advancements; if they suffer a Lasting Injury that would make a change to their Fighter card, they decide that the hideout is no longer safe and move on \u2013 they are removed from the gang roster. They cannot be given any equipment other than what is listed.\nBRUTES\n\nUnlike other Hangers-on, Brutes are purchased with the express intention that they be fielded in battle and are treated like any other fighter when selecting a crew. Unlike other Hangers-on, Brutes will gain Experience and Advancements in the same manner as a Specialist (see\u00a0\nExperience: Gangers\n). Unlike Hangers-on, Brutes will not leave the gang should they suffer a Lasting Injury that makes a change to their Fighter card.\nLast updated\u00a0on",

Therefore, when an Exotic Beast gains a new skill, roll a D3 and consult the table below:\n\n\n\n\nEXOTIC BEASTS SPECIAL RULES\n\nExotic Beasts follow all of the normal rules for a fighter, with the following exceptions:\nWhenever the fighter that owns the Exotic Beast is selected for a scenario, the Exotic Beast may also be deployed. This may take the number of fighters in a starting crew above the number specified by the scenario.\nExotic Beasts may not perform any action that interacts with objects on the battlefield with the following exceptions:\n\tAn Exotic Beast with a Strength characteristic of at least 4 may perform the Carry Loot Casket (Simple), Force Door (Basic) and Smash Open Loot Casket (Basic) actions.\n\tAn Exotic Beast with an Intelligence characteristic of at least 7+ may perform the Operate Door (Simple) action.\n\tAn Exotic Beast with an Intelligence characteristic of at least 5+ may perform the Access Terminal (Basic) and Bypass Loot Casket Lock (Basic) actions.\nExotic Beasts cannot assist fighters when rolling for Recovery.\nExotic Beasts can only be activated as part of a Group Activation with their owner. Accordingly, the owner of an Exotic Beast gains the following special rule:\n\tGroup Activation (Exotic Beasts):\n\t\u00a0When a fighter with this special rule is activated, their controlling player must activate all Exotic Beasts belonging to this fighter as well, as part of a \u2018Group Activation\u2019:\n\t\tThe controlling player selects and activates each fighter in this group activation as normal, fully resolving each activation before selecting and activating the next. Each fighter activates individually; groups do not activate simultaneously.\n\t\tIf this fighter itself is activated as part of a Group Activation, this rule still applies, meaning any Exotic Beasts this fighter owns are activated as described above when this fighter is itself activated as part of a Group Activation.\nExotic Beasts must always end their activation within 3\" of their owner. If the Exotic Beast is more than 3\" away at the end of its activation, it must pass a Nerve test or become Broken.\nShould an Exotic Beast become Broken, it will run towards its owner when activated rather than for cover. When an Exotic Beast makes a Running for Cover (Double) action, it runs towards its owner. It is only concerned with getting back within 3\" of its owner.\nAn Exotic Beast that has become Broken automatically rallies if it ends an activation within 3\" of its owner (note that, during Campaign play, Exotic Beasts do not gain XP for rallying in this way).\nIf the owner is removed from the battlefield for any reason, the Exotic Beast is also removed from play.\nExotic Beasts are not counted for Bottle tests, neither as part of the starting crew nor as fighters Taken Out of Action or Prone and Seriously Injured.\nIf an Exotic Beast is taken Out of Action or becomes Prone and Seriously Injured, only other Exotic Beasts need to take Nerve tests to avoid becoming Broken, gangers are made of sterner stuff and expect their beasts to lead short lives.\nExotic Beasts gain Experience and suffer Lasting Injuries as a normal Ganger and may become a Specialist.\nExotic Beasts may not take any additional equipment. They may not use weapons other than those detailed on their profile. They may never use Wargear.\nExotic Beasts can be taken Captive, in which case the owning fighter\u2019s gang can attempt to rescue them and the capturing gang may sell them as if they were a normal fighter.

Most gang leaders are experienced fighters, champions or heroes who have struck out on their own to further their legend and strengthen their position within their House. Accompanying these renowned fighters will be a core of close allies from their former gang, competent and seasoned fighters all. These fighters will form the core of the new gang, creating its hierarchy and leadership. To these dangerous individuals will flock aspiring gangers, the foot soldiers of their House. These fighters will be joined by green Juves and youthful Prospects. Juves are inexperienced rookies \u2013 in the parlance of Necromunda, those individuals with little to no fighting experience hoping to be accepted into a gang and prove their worth. Prospects represent the young hopefuls of the House. Often, these fighters are the sons and daughters of past gangers. Such fighters bring with them great potential, and a great weight of responsibility to their forebears.\nGANG CREATION\nWhen founding a gang, players will have a maximum budget of credits to spend on fighters, weapons, Wargear and vehicles chosen from the entries within their gang list. How much this budget is will depend upon whether the gang is being founded for Skirmish play or Campaign play. In either case, this budget may not be exceeded. Any unspent credits will be added to the gang\u2019s Stash if the gang has been founded for Campaign play. However, if a gang has been founded for Skirmish play, any unspent credits are simply lost.\nCAMPAIGN PLAY\n\nWhen founding a gang for Campaign play, the budget available is 1,000 credits. Note, however, that should they wish, the Arbitrator can increase or decrease this budget.\nAdditionally, if using vehicles in your campaign each gang gains an extra 400 credits that can only be spent on wargear that grants the Mounted condition, Crew, vehicles or fighters that come by default with Wargear that grants the Mounted condition. Any unspent credits from this allowance are lost after the gang is founded. Note that players may also spend some of their initial 1,000 credits on Crew, vehicles, fighters that come by default with Wargear that grants the Mounted condition and Wargear that grants the Mounted condition.\nSKIRMISH PLAY\n\nWhen founding a gang for Skirmish play, the budget available should be agreed upon by the players. This can be as much or as little as they think appropriate, but as a general guideline, a budget of between 1,250 credits and 2,000 credits is recommended.\nNOTE\nCAMPAIGN PLAY & SKIRMISH PLAY\n\nNecromunda is a game best played as part of a campaign \u2013 a series of linked battles where each player\u2019s gang grows and develops as the campaign progresses. As such the rules presented in this rulebook assume you are playing a campaign.\nHowever, campaign play is not the only way to play Necromunda as stand alone games can also be played. These are called skirmish battles.\nMODEL NAMES, CATEGORIES & TYPES\n\nEach model available to a gang is of a named type; this is the name given to that model\u2019s rank within the gang hierarchy of their House. In addition, each has a category listed in brackets. For example, a lowly gang fighter in an Orlock gang is an Orlock Gunner (Ganger). This indicates that within House Orlock, such fighters are called \u2018Gunners\u2019, whereas within the rules of the game, this fighter is a \u2018Ganger\u2019.\nVery often the rules will refer to models by category (Leader, Champion, Prospect, Ganger, Juve or Crew, for example). In such cases, the rule is universal to all such models, regardless of their type. At other times, the rules will refer to a model by their specific type, \u2018Orlock Gunner\u2019 for example. In these cases, the rule is specific only to models of that type.\nGANG COMPOSITION\n\nThe first step is to choose and purchase the models that make up the gang. Each of the different gang lists details all of the models available to that gang. These models are purchased by paying the credits cost shown in their entry from the budget available. Most gangs must always follow the rules presented below. In the case of any gangs that follow different rules, these will be presented as part of that gang\u2019s gang list:\nThere must be one model with the Leader special rule.",

In the case of any gangs that follow different rules, these will be presented as part of that gang\u2019s gang list:\nThere must be one model with the Leader special rule.\nThe total number of models with the Gang Fighter (X) special rule in the gang must always be equal to, or higher than, the total number of models without the Gang Fighter (X) special rule combined, not counting Hangers-on or Hired Guns.\nShould it occur during the course of a campaign that the number of models without the Gang Fighter (X) special rule exceeds the total number of models with the Gang Fighter (X) special rule, the controlling player must either:\nRetire a number of models without the Gang Fighter (X) special rule during the post-battle sequence in order to correct the imbalance.\nOr:\nRecruit fresh models with the Gang Fighter (X) special rule during the post-battle sequence in order to correct the imbalance.\nHIRING EXISTING FIGHTERS AND VEHICLES\n\nWhen creating a gang, players may wish to use fighters, Crew and vehicles from a gang they previously ran in a campaign so that they can continue to follow their story. In order to do this, players deduct their credits value from their budget and then add the fighter, Crew or vehicle to their new gang. When the model is added to your gang, they retain all weapons, Wargear, skills, Advancements and Lasting Injuries.\nWEAPONS & WARGEAR\n\nThe next step is to choose and purchase the weapons and Wargear each model will be equipped with. Each model\u2019s entry within their gang list includes a detailed list of the weapons and Wargear that model may purchase.\nEQUIPPING A FIGHTER\n\nAll fighters can be equipped as follows:\nA fighter on foot can be equipped with a maximum of three weapons purchased from those listed in their entry. A fighter subject to the Mounted condition can be equipped with a maximum of two.\nWeapons marked with an asterisk (*) take up the space of two weapons.\nAny fighter may purchase Wargear that is listed in their entry.\nWeapon accessories marked with a dagger (\u2020) may not be combined together on the same weapon. If one such accessory is purchased for a weapon, another may not be added.\nIf the gang is being founded for Campaign play, fighters will be limited to the equipment listed in their entry, whereas fighters in a gang founded for Skirmish play may also have access to some items of equipment from the Trading Post. This should be agreed upon by the players.\nEQUIPPING CREW\n\nAll Crew can be equipped as follows:\nCrew can be equipped with a maximum of two weapons, any weapons the Crew are equipped with gain the Arc (Front) trait.\nWeapon accessories marked with a dagger (\u2020) may not be combined together on the same weapon. If one such accessory is purchased for a weapon, another may not be added.\nAny Crew may purchase Wargear that is listed in their entry.\nIf the gang is being founded for Campaign play, Crew will be limited to the equipment listed in their entry, whereas Crew in a gang founded for Skirmish play may also have access to some items of equipment from the Trading Post. This should be agreed upon by the players.\nAll Crew must be equipped with a vehicle from their equipment list. Regardless of the size of the vehicle, one Crew is sufficient to fully operate the vehicle.\nNEW EQUIPMENT\n\nDuring a campaign, gangs may gain new equipment, either by purchasing it from either the Trading Post or their equipment list during the post-battle sequence, or as a result of\u00a0\nBoons\n. These items are added to the gang\u2019s Stash and may be distributed among fighters during any post-battle sequence:\nAny fighter or Crew may discard any Wargear (including a vehicle) they are equipped with in favour of new Wargear. Any Wargear discarded in this way is placed in the gang\u2019s Stash and may be given to other fighters.",

Note that this means Wargear can only be discarded if being replaced by an alternative itemthat fulfils a similar purpose.\nNo fighter or Crew may discard a weapon. The gang fighters of Necromunda become attached to their weapons of choice and would rather hoard weapons than discard them.\nNo fighter may discard Wargear that grants the Mounted condition. Out in the ash wastes having access to transport means the difference between life and death and no fighter would discard theirs.\nFighters and Crew with the Gang Fighter (X) special rule that do not also have the Tools of the Trade special rule cannot be given a new weapon if it would take them above the limit of weapons allowed (three for fighters and two for Crew).\nFighters and Crew with the Tools of the Trade special rule can be given more than three weapons as they can have multiple Fighter cards, each representing a different \u2018equipment set\u2019, see\u00a0\nEquipment Sets\n.\nEQUIPPING A VEHICLE\n\nVehicles can be equipped with a wide variety of weapons, Wargear and Upgrades. Most vehicles have a number of Weapon Hardpoints on them, each of which can be equipped with a weapon from those available to that vehicle. In some cases, it may be possible to add additional Weapon Hardpoints through Upgrades or Wargear.\nThere is no limit to the amount of Wargear that a vehicle may be fitted with, though some Wargear may not be combined with others; where this is the case it will be explained under the Wargear\u2019s rules. Each vehicle also has a set number of Upgrade slots that can be used, broken down into Body, Drive and Engine.\nVEHICLE UPGRADES\n\nAs mentioned previously, during a campaign gangs may gain new equipment, either by purchasing it from either the Trading Post or their equipment list during the post-battle sequence, or as a result of\u00a0\nBoons\n. This includes vehicle Upgrades, and new items of equipment that can be fitted to vehicles to improve their performance in a number of ways. These Upgrades are added to the gang\u2019s Stash and may be assigned to vehicles during any post-battle sequence.\nAny upgrade may be discarded from a vehicle in favour of a new Upgrade in the same slot. The gang may attempt to place any Upgrades discarded in this way into the gang\u2019s Stash. Roll a D6:\nOn a 1, the Upgrade is trashed. It may have suffered too much wear and tear, or it may have been removed with too much force. Whatever the case, the Upgrade is of no use and must be thrown away.\nOn a 2 or more, the Upgrade is removed intact. It may be fitted to another vehicle, kept in the gang\u2019s Stash or it may be sold during the\u00a0\npost-battle sequence\n.\nNote that this means Upgrades can only be discarded if being replaced by an alternative item that fulfils a similar purpose.\nFIGHTER CARDS & VEHICLE CARDS\n\nFinally, a blank Fighter card or Vehicle card should be completed for each model when they are added to the gang; the characteristics of the model and any equipment they now have should be noted down in the appropriate sections of the model\u2019s card.\nEQUIPMENT SETS\n\nSenior gang members, enjoying the privilege of rank, often maintain a cache of weapons that allows them to equip themselves appropriately for each battle. As such, fighters or Crew with the Tools of the Trade special rule can have multiple Fighter cards or Vehicle cards, each representing a different set of equipment:\nThe controlling player can make an additional Fighter card or Vehicle card for a fighter or Crew with the Tools of the Trade special rule at any time.\nAn appropriate model should be available for each different equipment set and/or Fighter card or Vehicle card a fighter or Crew has.\nThere is no additional cost for having multiple equipment sets.",
        "038bd619-6018-4d55-b306-58936dfc7b04": "FIGHTER CARDS & VEHICLE CARDS\n\nFinally, a blank Fighter card or Vehicle card should be completed for each model when they are added to the gang; the characteristics of the model and any equipment they now have should be noted down in the appropriate sections of the model\u2019s card.\nEQUIPMENT SETS\n\nSenior gang members, enjoying the privilege of rank, often maintain a cache of weapons that allows them to equip themselves appropriately for each battle.

If, for example, an Orlock Road Captain owns a two-handed hammer, they may include that weapon in as many or as few different equipment sets as the controlling player wishes without additional cost. The weapon is only purchased and paid for once.\nRegardless of the number of equipment sets a fighter or Crew has, they still have a single entry on the gang roster. This entry should include the total cost of the individual weapons and items of Wargear that fighter or Crew owns. But remember, each individual weapon or item of Wargear is only counted once.\nIf the fighter or Crew suffers any Lasting Injuries or gains any Advancements, they should be recorded on all of their Fighter cards or Vehicle cards.\nOnly one of a fighter\u2019s cards or Crew\u2019s cards can be used for a battle.\nIf a battle uses random models from the gang, all of the fighter\u2019s or Crew\u2019s cards should be shuffled together and one should be drawn at random and added to the rest of the gang\u2019s Fighter cards or Vehicle cards before any cards are drawn. This means that only one of this fighter\u2019s or Crew\u2019s cards can be drawn for the battle, and that the controlling player cannot choose which of their equipment sets they will be using.\nWhen distributing equipment from the gang\u2019s Stash, it can be moved to any or all of an individual fighter\u2019s or Crew\u2019s cards, and can even be moved to more than one.\nDEATH OF A LEADER\n\nAll gangs must include a single fighter with the \u2018Gang Leader\u2019 special rule. This fighter is, naturally, the Leader of the gang. If a gang\u2019s Leader is killed, a new leader must be nominated:\nThe new Leader is the fighter with the highest Leadership characteristic, selected from among those fighters that have, in order of priority:\n\tThe Gang Hierarchy (X) special rule.\n\tThe Tools of the Trade special rule.\nIf the gang contains no fighters with either special rule, the fighter with the highest Leadership characteristic must be selected from among the remaining gang members.\nIf two or more eligible fighters have the same Leadership characteristic, use Advancements as a tie-breaker; if there is still a tie, the controlling player can decide which fighter will become the new gang Leader.\nWhen a fighter is promoted in this way, they gain the Gang Leader special rule, and from now on their category changes to \u2018Leader\u2019 and their type changes to that appropriate for their gang for the purposes of determining which equipment and Skill Sets they can access (for example, should an Orlock Road Sergeant be promoted to Leader, not only does their category change from Champion to Leader, but their type becomes \u2018Orlock Road Captain\u2019). They lose the Promotion (X) special rules if they have it, though their existing characteristics and other special rules do not change.\nOUTLAW GANGS\n\nEven in a place as lawless as the underhive there are rules. A Clan House-aligned gang might murder and steal from their rivals with the sanctioning of their House, provided they respect the authority of the Guilders and the Imperial House that backs them. Some gangs, however, either through a determination to do as they please, or because they have dabbled in things forbidden by the Imperium, exist outside this official structure of gang warfare. These are Outlaw gangs, ranging from ex-House criminals and fugitives from the spire, through to Chaos-enthralled and even xenos-tainted cults dedicated to the arch-enemies of Mankind.\nBECOMING AN OUTLAW\n\nIf the Arbitrator wishes, their campaign can include the rules for Outlaw and Law Abiding gangs. These are optional rules that can add a lot of flavour to the game, but will significantly change how some gangs operate and so should only be used if all players agree.",

These are optional rules that can add a lot of flavour to the game, but will significantly change how some gangs operate and so should only be used if all players agree.\nThese rules represent gangs who operate outside the established \u2018rules\u2019 of the underhive and gain various benefits and drawbacks as a result. Gangs can either choose to begin the campaign as Outlaws or might become Outlaws during the course of the campaign. There are a number of ways in which a gang might be outlawed, such as using illegal weapons bought from the Black Market or turning to the worship of Chaos. In all cases these will be clearly stated in the rules. The Arbitrator too has the power to outlaw a gang (or pardon an already Outlaw gang), though this will usually be as a result of their actions in a scenario (openly killing Enforcers or Guilders), or for reasons relating to the campaign being played (stealing from Lord Helmawr\u2019s Ghast reserves or employing a notorious rogue psyker).\nSome gangs such as Corpse Grinders, Chaos Corrupted gangs and Helot Chaos Cultists are openly deviant and so if the rules for Outlaws are being used, they begin the campaign as an Outlaw gang.\nEFFECTS OF BEING AN OUTLAW GANG\n\nOutlaw gangs gain the following effects:\nOutlaw gangs cannot sell Captives to the Guilders or claim bounties for them, but can dispose of them (removing them from the campaign) or, in some cases, sacrifice them to the Dark Gods once their owner\u2019s gang has had a chance to rescue them.\nOutlaw gangs may trade Captives with any other gang as they wish.\nOutlaw gangs can hire only Outlaw Hangers-on, Brutes, Hired Guns and Dramatis Personae.\nAll fighters in an Outlaw gang have a bounty on their head.\nOutlaw gangs have restricted access to the Trading Post in the post-battle sequence, though they may freely visit the Black Market.\nOutlaw gangs may form Criminal Alliances (see page 13 of Necromunda: The Book of Judgement).\nHired Guns (Bounty Hunters, Hive Scum, etc.) hired by an Outlaw gang automatically gain the Outlaw special rule.\nOutlaw gangs may not hire any Dramatis Personae that does not have the Outlaw special rule.\nOUTLAW HOUSE GANGS\n\nWhen a House gang \u2013 Goliath, Van Saar, Delaque, Escher, Cawdor and Orlock \u2013 becomes an Outlaw gang, they lose their connections with their House. This means they cannot roll on the House Favours table, use House Sub-plots, purchase House specific Brutes and Exotic Beasts or hire House specific Dramatis Personae. If a gang has a House specific Brute when they become an Outlaw gang, they may retain it, however if the Brute is later lost, such as to a decrease in reputation, then it may not be replaced.\nEFFECTS OF BEING A LAW ABIDING GANG\n\nLaw Abiding gangs gain the following effects:\nLaw Abiding gangs can sell Captives to the Guilders and can claim bounties for them, once their owner\u2019s gang has had a chance to rescue them.\nLaw Abiding gangs may trade Captives with other Law Abiding gangs, but may not trade Captives back to Outlaw gangs.\nLaw Abiding gangs can hire any Hangers-on, Brutes, Hired Guns and Dramatis Personae that do not have the Outlaw special rule.\nFighters in a Law Abiding gang do not have bounties on their heads.",

Conditions are denoted by placing a Condition marker either next to the fighter on the battlefield or on their Fighter card as a reminder that the Condition is in effect. Some Conditions can also affect vehicles, in these cases the Condition marker is placed either next to the vehicle or on their Vehicle card.\nThe following list of Conditions is not exhaustive. Some Conditions are common and will apply to a model many times during a battle. Others are less common and may be the result of an attack from a weapon with a certain Trait; the full rules for such Conditions can be found in the corresponding Weapon Trait rules. Other Conditions, in particular Out of Ammo, may apply specifically to a weapon the model carries rather than the model themselves. A model may be subject to several Conditions at the same time.\nAny in-game effect that results in a marker being placed on a model should be considered a Condition.\nCOMMON CONDITIONS\n\nThe following Conditions are those most commonly used. A model can become subject to them for numerous reasons:\nREADY\n\nThe most simple but arguably the most important Condition. At the start of each round, during the Priority phase, all models will have a Ready marker placed on them. Once that model has activated during the Action phase, this marker is removed, indicating that the model may not be activated again.\nBROKEN\n\nA fighter may become Broken as the result of either seeing a friendly fighter Seriously Injured or taken Out of Action within 3\" of them, or seeing a friendly vehicle Wrecked within 6\" of them. Broken fighters may not perform any actions other than Running for Cover (Double), which they perform every time they are activated. If Standing and Engaged, a Broken fighter may only make Reaction attacks, and must apply a -2 modifier to their Hit rolls. Broken fighters may be rallied in the End phase.\nA vehicle may become Broken as the result of seeing a friendly vehicle Wrecked within 6\" of them. Broken vehicles may not perform any actions other than Break For Air (Double) if Mobile or Burn Out (Double) if Stationary and Stalled, which they perform every time they are activated. Broken vehicles may be rallied in the End phase.\nOUT OF AMMO\n\nShould a model roll the Ammo symbol on\u00a0\nthe Firepower dice\n, they are required to make an immediate Ammo test for that weapon. If this is failed, that weapon is now Out of Ammo. To represent this, a marker is placed on the appropriate weapon profile on the model\u2019s Fighter card or Vehicle card as a reminder that the weapon cannot be used until it has been reloaded.\nNote that, unlike other Conditions, Out of Ammo is applied to a weapon carried by a model rather than the model themselves. It is therefore possible for a model to have multiple Out of Ammo markers on them at one time, indicating more than one weapon is subject to the Condition.\nFLESHWOUND(S)\n\nThese are suffered as a result of Injury dice rolls made against a fighter, or the Driver Wounded result on the\u00a0\nCrew Damage table\n. A fighter can suffer multiple Flesh Wounds, each of which reduces their Toughness characteristic by 1 for the remainder of the battle. If a fighter is reduced to Toughness 0 as a result of multiple Flesh Wounds, they go Out of Action.\nOTHER CONDITIONS\n\nThe following Conditions are less frequently seen, but are no less significant. Models may become subject to them as the result of an attack from a weapon with a certain Trait, or as the result of a scenario or terrain special rule:\nBLAZE\n\nHow the Blaze condition affects a model depends upon whether it is a fighter or vehicle. Regardless of model type, models subject to the Blaze condition can never become Hidden and cannot make Reaction attacks.\nFighter:\n\u00a0When activated, a fighter subject to the Blaze condition suffers an immediate S3, AP -1, D1 hit (see\u00a0\nResolving Hits\n) and must act as follows, after which their activation will end:\nIf Prone and Pinned, the fighter immediately becomes Standing and Active and acts as described below.\nIf Standing and Active, the fighter moves 2D6\" in a random direction, determined by the Scatter dice. The fighter will stop moving if this movement would bring them within 1\" of an enemy fighter or into base contact with impassable terrain. If this movement brings them within \u00bd\" of the edge of a level or platform, they risk falling.",

At the end of this move, the fighter may choose to become Prone and Pinned. The fighter may then attempt to put the fire out.\nIf Standing and Engaged or Prone and Seriously Injured, the fighter does not move and attempts to put the fire out.\nTo attempt to put the fire out, roll a D6, adding 1 to the result for each other Active friendly fighter within 1\". On a roll of 6 or more, the flames go out and the Blaze condition is removed. Prone and Pinned or Seriously Injured fighters add 2 to the roll to see if the flames go out.\nNOTE\nVEHICLES AND CONDITIONS\n\nThere are a huge number of Conditions in Necromunda, unless stated otherwise they do not affect vehicles at all.\nVehicles:\n\u00a0When activated, a vehicle subject to the Blaze condition suffers an immediate S3, AP -1, D1 hit against the Rear Toughness (roll location as normal, see\u00a0\nResolving Hits Against Vehicles\n). They must then make a Cool test:\nIf passed, nothing happens, they can continue their activation as normal.\nIf failed and the vehicle is Mobile, they act as if they had failed a\u00a0\nLoss of Control test\n\u00a0then their activation ends.\nIf failed and the vehicle is Stationary and Stalled, they must perform the Burn Out (Double) action then their activation ends.\nAt the end of their activation, roll a D6. On a 4+, the flames go out and the Blaze condition is removed.\nBLIND\n\nWhen hit by a weapon with the Flash trait, a fighter or vehicle risks becoming\u00a0\nBlind\n. A Blind model loses their Ready marker; if they do not have a Ready marker, they do not gain a Ready marker at the start of the following round. Until the next time the model is activated, they cannot make any attacks other than Reaction attacks, for which any hit rolls will only succeed on a natural 6 (note: vehicles cannot make Reaction attacks).\nCONCUSSION\n\nAny fighter hit by a Concussion weapon will have their Initiative reduced by 2, to a minimum of 6+, until the end of the round. Any vehicle hit by a Concussion weapon will suffer a -2 penalty to all Handling tests until the end of the round.\nHIDDEN/REVEALED\n\nSome scenarios or terrain special rules, such as the\u00a0\nVisibility rules\n\u00a0allow models to gain the Hidden condition. Hidden models can then lose this Condition over the course of a game by gaining the Revealed condition.\nINTOXICATED\n\nThere are numerous special rules that can cause a model to become intoxicated. These include certain skills, special rules associated with terrain or Wargear, and more besides. Whatever the cause, the ways in which the Intoxicated condition affects a model are many and varied, and will be detailed by the special rules that cause the Condition.\nINSANE\n\nCertain skills, some types of terrain and some scenario rules may lead a model to become temporarily insane.

When activating an Insane model, roll a D6 and consult the table below:\n\n\n\n\nHOUSE RULE (A&A)\nRoll a willpower check at the end of activation to see if they become sane.\nWEBBED\n\nWhile a fighter is Webbed, treat them as if they were Seriously Injured and roll for Recovery for them during the End phase (Web contains a powerful sedative capable of rendering the strongest fighter unconscious). If a Flesh Wound result is rolled during Recovery, apply the result to the fighter as usual and remove the Webbed condition. If a Serious Injury result is rolled, the fighter remains Webbed, but they do not gain a Flesh Wound. If an Out of Action result is rolled, the fighter succumbs to the powerful sedative and is removed from play. Instead of rolling on the Lasting Injury table, roll a D6 to determine what happens to them \u2013 on a result of 1-4 suffer the 15-26 (Out Cold) result, on a 5-6 they suffer the 55-56 (Captured) result (see the\u00a0\nLasting Injury Table\n).\nA fighter that is Webbed at the end of the battle does not succumb to their Injuries and will automatically recover.\nMOUNTED\n\nSeveral items of Wargear, ranging from beasts of burden to Waster\u2019s dirtbikes, give the fighter the Mounted condition. This comprises of the following group of rules:\nHands Full:\n\u00a0A fighter that is Mounted reduces the total number of weapons they can carry by one and cannot be equipped with any weapon with the Unwieldy trait unless it also has the Lance trait. In addition, they can never use more than one weapon in close combat.\nWhen fighting with a weapon with the Paired trait, a fighter subject to the Mounted condition does not gain a bonus attack for being equipped with two close combat weapons, nor do they double their Attacks characteristic when they perform a Charge (Double) action.\nRide By:\n\u00a0A Mounted fighter may move within 1\" of a single enemy model when performing a Move (Simple) action. When doing so, or if within Long range of a weapon with the Versatile trait, the fighter may interrupt their movement to make a single close combat attack against that model.

If this test is passed, the fighter does not become Prone and Pinned but remains Standing and Active. If this test is failed, they are Knocked Down.\nWhen a Mounted fighter is Knocked Down, they immediately suffer an automatic hit.

The actions a fighter can perform during their activation will depend heavily upon their current Status. During a game of Necromunda, a fighter\u2019s Status can change. This is generally represented by how the fighter is positioned on the battlefield, be they Standing or Prone, as described below, but may also depend upon other factors.\nSTANDING\n\nA fighter that is upright on the battlefield is said to be \u2018Standing\u2019. Whilst Standing, a fighter may perform a wide range of actions with relative ease.\nSECONDARY STATUSES WHILE STANDING\n\nWhilst Standing, a fighter will always be subject to one of two Secondary Statuses as well: \u2018Active\u2019 or \u2018Engaged\u2019. This Secondary Status will affect the actions a Standing fighter may perform during their activation.\nActive:\n\u00a0A Standing fighter is Active if they are not currently engaged with any enemy fighters. This is the default Status for a fighter; Standing and Active, and such fighters enjoy the greatest freedom to perform actions.\nEngaged:\n\u00a0In order for fighters to make close combat attacks, they must be engaging an enemy model:\nIf the base of a Standing fighter is touching the base of an enemy fighter, they are said to be in base to base contact and are engaged with that enemy fighter.\nIf the base of a Standing fighter is within 1\" of any part of an enemy vehicle, they may choose to Engage that vehicle.\nA vehicle cannot Engage an enemy fighter.\nA Standing fighter that is Engaged can generally only choose actions that allow them to fight or retreat, but other factors such as skills may increase the number of available options.\nPlayers should note that in some cases a fighter may be able to Engage an enemy fighter they are not in base to base contact with, or an enemy vehicle that they are not within 1\" of. For example, weapons with the Versatile trait allow a fighter to Engage enemy models from further away.\nPRONE\n\nA fighter that is laid down is \u2018Prone\u2019. A Prone fighter has no facing and they effectively have no vision arc. Unless otherwise stated, Prone fighters never block line of sight \u2013 they are considered to be well out of the way of the action. A Prone fighter may be placed face-up or face-down, depending upon their Secondary Status.\nSECONDARY STATUSES WHILE PRONE\n\nWhilst Prone, a fighter will always be subject to one of two Secondary Statuses as well: \u2018Pinned\u2019 or \u2018Seriously Injured\u2019. This Secondary Status will affect the actions a Prone fighter may perform and the way in which other models may interact with them.\nPinned:\n\u00a0Fighters generally become Prone and \u2018Pinned\u2019 as a result of being hit by enemy fire, and will need to spend an action to stand up, becoming Standing and Active. If a Prone and Pinned fighter ever becomes engaged by an enemy fighter, they will immediately perform a Stand Up (Basic) action for free (i.e., without having to spend an action to do so), becoming Standing and Engaged, though they do count as having had to\u00a0\nTurn to Face\n. A fighter can never be both Prone and Pinned and Engaged.\nA Prone fighter that is Pinned is laid face-up, representing the fighter keeping their head down to avoid enemy fire.\nSeriously Injured:\n\u00a0If a fighter should suffer a \u2018Serious Injury\u2019 result on an Injury dice (either as the result of being reduced to 0 Wounds, or as the result of an attack from a weapon with a Trait such as Gas or Toxin), that fighter is laid face-down and becomes Prone and Seriously Injured. A fighter is very vulnerable whilst this is their Status, being susceptible to enemy attacks against which they cannot defend themselves and being unable to move quickly towards safety.\nVEHICLE STATUS\n\nThe Status of a vehicle indicates its degree of mobility. The actions available to a vehicle during its activation will depend heavily upon its current Status. During a game of Necromunda, a vehicle\u2019s Status can change. This generally represents how fast the vehicle is moving or, if it has halted, why it has done so, as described below, but may also depend upon other factors.\nMOBILE\n\nWhilst a vehicle is \u2018Mobile\u2019 it is able to move quite freely around the battlefield, performing a range of actions with ease.\nSTATIONARY\n\nA vehicle that is unable to move for any reason is \u2018Stationary\u2019. Whilst Stationary, the actions available to the vehicle may be dramatically reduced.",

This Secondary Status essentially explains why the vehicle is Stationary and will determine how easily it can become Mobile (if at all) and which actions it can perform during its activation.\nStalled:\n\u00a0A Stationary vehicle is Stalled if it has been forced to stop moving by an enemy attack, by damage, or by any other in-game effect or special rule that prevents the vehicle from moving. Stalled vehicles can often fire their weapons, but must \u2018Restart\u2019 (see\u00a0\nStationary & Stalled Vehicles\n) before they can move off.\nWrecked:\n\u00a0During the course of a battle, a vehicle might become Stationary and Wrecked due to damage sustained. Once a vehicle is Wrecked it can no longer perform any actions and is treated like a piece of terrain.\nNOTE\nDETERMINING STATUS\n\nThe Primary and Secondary Status of both fighters and vehicles can change often. Most often, Status will change during the model\u2019s activation, but it can also change during the activation of other models. Players should determine the Primary and Secondary Status of each model at the end of its activation for the benefit of their opponent and keep track of any changes as play progresses. When a model is activated, confirm its current Primary and Secondary Status.\nLast updated\u00a0on",
        "e3eb302e-6492-4b21-a147-73aa8f4c4aab": "ROLLING DICE\nSource: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)\nA game of Necromunda uses dice rolls a great deal. The roll of a dice determines everything, be it a fighter\u2019s ability to keep their cool in the heat of battle, or the effectiveness of a shot fired from a lasgun. Throughout the rules, players will encounter certain terms that relate to the rolling of dice.\nSINGLE DICE ROLLS\n\nThe rules will often require a player to roll a single dice, in which case the rules will state quite simply \u2018roll a D6\u2019. Sometimes the rules might require several single dice to be rolled at once, for example, \u2018roll three D6\u2019 means three dice are rolled together, but the result of each dice is considered separately.\nMULTIPLE DICE ROLLS\n\nOften the rules will require a player to roll multiple D6s and add the results together. For example, the rules might instruct a player to \u2018roll 2D6\u2019. In such cases, two D6 are rolled and the results added together to give a total between 2 and 12. This is a multiple dice roll.\nDICE POOLS\n\nSometimes the game may require two or more dice be rolled and a single result selected \u2013 for example, a player might roll two or three Location dice and select one result to apply. In this case a \u2018pool\u2019 of dice has been rolled.\nTARGET NUMBER ROLLS\n\nUsually, when making a single dice roll or a multiple dice roll, the rules will require a player to roll a specific number followed by a \u2018+\u2019. This indicates that the roll is a \u2018target number roll\u2019. Making a target number roll is simple. If a player is required to roll a 4+ on a single D6, for example, a roll of 4, 5 or 6 would be a success, but a roll of 1, 2 or 3 would not be.\nMODIFYING DICE ROLLS\n\nThe rules will often call for a dice roll to be modified, particularly when making a target number roll. To do this, simply roll the dice and then add or subtract the modifier(s) shown, effectively changing the outcome of the dice roll. If the rules ever require a player to divide a dice roll in any way, any fractions should be rounded up, unless the rules state otherwise.\nROLLING OFF\n\nThe rules may call for both players to roll a dice (usually either a D6 or a D3). Often a characteristic of some sort will be added to the result. This is called \u2018rolling off\u2019 and the highest score always wins a roll-off. In the case of a tie, roll again unless otherwise instructed.\nNATURAL ROLLS\n\nA \u2018natural\u2019 roll is the actual number rolled on a dice, regardless of modifiers (including the halving of the result rolled on a D6 when rolling it as a D3). It is not uncommon for a natural roll to grant a bonus or a penalty, or to grant an automatic success or cause an automatic failure, regardless of any modifiers that might apply to the dice roll.\nRE-ROLLS\n\nWhen rolling dice, it is common for things to go wrong! Fortunately, there are many special rules that allow for certain dice rolls to be re-rolled:\nThe second result must always be accepted, even if it is worse than the original result.\nA dice can never be re-rolled more than once, regardless of the source of the re-roll.\nLast updated\u00a0on",

LORD OF THE RATS\n\nFriendly Juve (or Prospect) fighters that are within 12\" of this fighter and can draw line of sight to them may apply a +2 modifier to their Cool checks and Willpower checks. Rats, including Necromunda Rats, Bomb Delivery Rats and any rats that feature in a battle due to a scenario or environment special rule, that end their movement within 3\" of the fighter are immediately moved by the smallest amount possible so they are at least 3\" away from the fighter.\n2. SCAVENGER'S EYE\n\nDuring any scenario that features loot markers, scrap or any kind of harvested goods that are then transformed into credits at the end of the battle, the fighter\u2019s gang may add an additional +1 to the dice roll for determining their worth. For example, if a scenario called for the gathering of loot and each loot marker held by the gang at the end of the battle was worth D3x10 credits, then each one would grant the fighter\u2019s gang (D3+1)x10 credits.\n3.

Until the start of their next activation, improve their Weapon Skill, Cool, Leadership and Willpower characteristics by D3, rolling separately for each characteristic. At the end of their activation, the fighter immediately suffers an automatic Damage 1 hit which cannot be saved. Devotional Frenzy can only be declared once per round.\n6. RESTLESS FAITH\n\nDuring the Choose Crew step of the pre-battle sequence, this fighter may be taken out of Recovery (see the Necromunda Rulebook) and included in the deck of available fighters. If this is done and the fighter takes part in the battle, they begin the battle with a single Flesh Wound.\nOBFUSCATION\n\nSource: House of Shadows\n1. FACELESS\n\nFrom the start of each round until after this fighter has activated, enemy fighters must pass a Willpower check to target them with a ranged attack, or place a Blast marker so that it is touching their base. If the check is failed, the enemy fighter may choose another target.\n2. PSI-TOUCHED\n\nThe fighter may re-roll Willpower checks when attempting to activate Wyrd Powers or to resist them. When visiting the Black Market as part of the postbattle sequence, the fighter may always choose to purchase Ghast without the need to make an Availability roll.\n3. TAKE DOWN\n\nWhen this fighter takes an enemy fighter Out of Action, place that enemy fighter to one side. At the end of the battle, if this fighter\u2019s gang has won the scenario, then instead of using the normal method for determining if enemy fighters are captured, roll a D6 for each enemy fighter that was taken Out of Action and placed aside by this fighter.

This section deals with measurement, line of sight and cover, offers an overview of terrain and further explains the different dice and their use. Additionally, this section explains fighter and vehicle Statuses, Secondary Statuses and Conditions, all important factors that dictate the actions a model can or cannot perform.\nFIRST PRINCIPLES\nSource: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)\nIn any game, there are certain conventions for all players to be aware of. In Necromunda, these include such things as when players can or cannot measure distances, when it is acceptable to change one\u2019s mind, and so forth.\nFIGHTERS, VEHICLES & MODELS\n\nIn games of Necromunda, players use finely-detailed models to represent the fighters and vehicles of their gangs on the battlefield. In game terms, it is sensible to be quite precise in how such things are defined in order that players can easily interpret the rules:\nAny model that represents a single humanoid or a single animal is referred to as a \u2018fighter\u2019 by the rules. This could be a lowly gang member, a renowned hired gun, or even an exotic beast owned by a mighty gang champion.\nAny model that is mounted on a single-person animal or bike is a fighter subject to the\u00a0\nMounted condition\n.\nAny model that represents a vehicle of any type, be it a small vehicle operated by a single driver or large vehicle crewed by many, is referred to as a \u2018vehicle\u2019 by the rules.\nBattlefield details such as a\u00a0\nBeast\u2019s Lair\n\u00a0are never referred to as models but rather as markers.\nWhere the rules use the terms \u2018fighter\u2019 or \u2018vehicle\u2019, they are referring specifically to models of that type. However, where the rules use the term \u2018model\u2019 or \u2018models\u2019, they are referring to both fighters and vehicles.\nCONTROLLING & OPPOSING PLAYER\n\nFrequently, rules will refer to the controlling player \u2013 this is the player whose model is being affected; the opposing player is their opponent.\nTAKE-BACKS & CHANGING ONE\u2019S MIND\n\nIt is not uncommon for players of any game to secondguess themselves occasionally, saying they are about to do something before immediately changing their mind. As a general rule, players should be tolerant of this in their opponents, as they will likely do it themselves! However, once dice have been rolled for any reason, or the range of a declared action measured, players must abide by their decision; they can no longer go back and change anything that came before the dice roll or the act of measuring!\nLast updated\u00a0on",
        "c21da176-d8e9-466f-b4eb-4b9d11a366e5": "SKILLS\nSource: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)\nThis section presents the full list of universal skills available to models. This section is split into nine lists, one for each Skill Set. Each entry lists the skill by name, and then its rules. Note that crew can only gain skills from the Driving, Leadership, Shooting and Savant sets.\nNOTE\nUNIVERSAL SKILLS AND GANG SPECIFIC SKILLS\n\nA number of gangs also their own unique set of skills that they have access to. These are listed in\u00a0\nGang-Specific Skills\n.\nThe following two tables summarise each of the Skill Sets, and can be used (by rolling a D6) to determine a random skill from one of the Skill Sets:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAGILITY\n\n1. CATFALL\n\nWhen this fighter falls or jumps down from a ledge, they count the vertical distance moved as being half of what it actually is, rounded up. In addition, if they are not Prone and Seriously Injured or taken Out of Action by a fall, make an Initiative test for them \u2013 if it is passed, they remain Standing rather than being Prone and Pinned.\nOPTIONAL HOUSE RULE\nWhen falling into a pitfall, mark the closest edge. At the end of that round, place the fighter next to the pitfall on a 4+.\n2. CLAMBER\n\nWhen this fighter climbs, the distance they move is not halved. In other words, they always count as climbing up or down a ladder.\nOPTIONAL HOUSE RULE\nMove freely through ductways without spending a Crawl Through (Double) action.\n3. DODGE\n\nIf this fighter suffers a wound from a ranged or close combat attack, roll a D6. On a 6, the attack is dodged and has no further effect; otherwise, continue to make a save or resolve the wound as normal. If the model dodges a weapon that uses a Blast marker or Flame template, a roll of 6 does not automatically cancel the attack \u2013 instead, it allows the fighter to move up to 2\" before seeing if they are hit. They cannot move within 1\" of an enemy fighter\n4. MIGHTY LEAP\n\nWhen measuring the distance of a gap this fighter wishes to leap across, ignore the first 2\" of the distance. This means that a fighter with this skill may leap over gaps of 2\" or less without testing against their Initiative. All other rules for leaping over gaps still apply.\n5. SPRING UP\n\nIf this fighter is Prone and Pinned when they are activated, make an Initiative test for them. If the test is passed, the fighter may make a Stand Up (Basic) action for free. If the test is failed, the fighter may still stand up, but it costs one action, as usual.\n6. SPRINT\n\nIf this fighter makes two Move (Simple) actions when activated during a round, they can use the second to Sprint. This lets them move at double their Movement characteristic for the second Move (Simple) action.\nBRAWN\n\n1. BULL CHARGE\n\nWhen the fighter makes close combat attacks as part of a Charge (Double) action, any weapons with the Melee trait they use gain the Knockback trait and are resolved at +1 Strength.\n2. BULGING BICEPS\n\nThis fighter may wield an Unwieldy weapon in one hand rather than the usual two. Note that Unwieldy weapons still take up the space of two weapons with regards to how many a fighter may carry.\n3. CRUSHING BLOW\n\nBefore rolling to hit for the fighter\u2019s close combat attacks, the controlling player can nominate one dice to make a Crushing Blow. This cannot be a dice that is rolling for a weapon with the Sidearm trait. If that dice hits, the attack\u2019s Strength and Damage are increased by one.\n4. HEADBUTT\n\nIf the fighter is Standing and Engaged, they can make the following action:\nHeadbutt (Free):\n\u00a0Pick an enemy fighter engaged by, and in base contact with, this fighter and roll two D6. If either result is equal to or higher than their Toughness, they suffer a hit with a Strength equal to this fighter\u2019s +2, resolved at Damage 2. However, if both dice score lower than the enemy fighter\u2019s Toughness, this fighter instead suffers a hit equal to their own Strength, resolved at Damage 1.\n5.",

CRUSHING BLOW\n\nBefore rolling to hit for the fighter\u2019s close combat attacks, the controlling player can nominate one dice to make a Crushing Blow. This cannot be a dice that is rolling for a weapon with the Sidearm trait. If that dice hits, the attack\u2019s Strength and Damage are increased by one.\n4. HEADBUTT\n\nIf the fighter is Standing and Engaged, they can make the following action:\nHeadbutt (Free):\n\u00a0Pick an enemy fighter engaged by, and in base contact with, this fighter and roll two D6. If either result is equal to or higher than their Toughness, they suffer a hit with a Strength equal to this fighter\u2019s +2, resolved at Damage 2. However, if both dice score lower than the enemy fighter\u2019s Toughness, this fighter instead suffers a hit equal to their own Strength, resolved at Damage 1.\n5. HURL\n\nIf the fighter is Standing and Engaged, they can perform the following action:\nHurl (Basic):\n\u00a0Pick an enemy fighter engaged by and in base contact with this fighter, or a Prone and Seriously Injured enemy fighter within 1\" of this fighter. Make an Initiative test for the enemy fighter. If failed, the enemy fighter is hurled. Move the enemy fighter D3\" in a direction of your choice \u2013 if they were Standing, they become Prone and Pinned after moving. If they come into base contact with a Standing fighter, vehicle or any terrain, they stop moving and suffer a Strength 3, Damage 1 hit. If they come into base contact with another model, that model also suffers a Strength 3, Damage 1 hit, and if the model is a fighter, they become Prone and Pinned. This action can also be performed for free after successfully performing a Charge (Double) action instead of a free Fight (Basic) action.\n6. IRON JAW\n\nThis fighter\u2019s Toughness is treated as being two higher than normal when another fighter attacks them in close combat with a weapon with an AP characteristic of -.\nCOMBAT\n\n1. COMBAT MASTER\n\nThe fighter never suffers penalties to their hit rolls for interference, and can always grant assists, regardless of how many enemy fighters they are engaged with.\n2. COUNTER-ATTACK\n\nWhen this fighter makes Reaction attacks in close combat, they roll one additional Attack dice for each of the attacker\u2019s Attacks that failed to hit (whether they missed, were parried, etc).\n3. DISARM\n\nAny weapons with the Melee trait used by the fighter also gain the Disarm trait. If a weapon already has this Trait then the target will be disarmed on a natural roll of a 5 or 6, rather than the usual 6.\n4. PARRY\n\nThe fighter can parry attacks as though they were carrying a weapon with the Parry trait. If they already have one or more weapons with this Trait, they can parry one additional attack.\n5. RAIN OF BLOWS\n\nThis fighter treats the Fight action as Fight (Simple) rather than Fight (Basic). In other words, this fighter may make two Fight (Simple) actions when activated.\nOPTIONAL HOUSE RULE\nAllow the fighter to make 2 consecutive Fight actions when charging (and potentially receiving 2 reaction attacks as well).\n6. STEP ASIDE\n\nIf the fighter is hit in close combat, the fighter can attempt to step aside. Make an Initiative test for them. If the test is passed, the attack misses. This skill can only be used once per enemy in each round of close combat \u2013 in other words, if an enemy makes more than one attack, the fighter can only attempt to step aside from one of them.\nCUNNING\n\n1. BACKSTAB\n\nAny weapons used by this fighter with the Melee trait also gain the Backstab trait. If they already have this Trait, add 2 to the attack\u2019s Strength rather than the usual 1 when the Trait is used.\nOPTIONAL HOUSE RULE\nIf benefiting from this skill, apply an additional -1 AP.\n2. ESCAPE ARTIST\n\nWhen this fighter makes a Retreat (Basic) action, add 2 to the result of their Initiative test (a natural 1 still fails). Additionally, if this fighter is Captured at the end of a battle, and if they are equipped with a skinblade, they may add 1 to the result of the dice roll to see if they can escape during the Rescue Mission scenario.\n3.",

Additionally, if this fighter is Captured at the end of a battle, and if they are equipped with a skinblade, they may add 1 to the result of the dice roll to see if they can escape during the Rescue Mission scenario.\n3. EVADE\n\nIf an enemy targets this fighter with a ranged attack, and this fighter is Standing and Active and not in partial cover or full cover, there is an additional -1 modifier to the hit roll, or a -2 modifier if the attack is at Long range.\n4. INFILTRATE\n\nIf this fighter should be set up at the start of a battle, they may instead be placed to one side. Then, immediately before the start of the first round, their controlling player may set them up anywhere on the battlefield that is not visible to any enemy fighters, and not within 6\" of any of them. If both players have fighters with this skill, take turns to set one up, starting with the winner of a roll-off.\nOPTIONAL HOUSE RULE\nInfiltrate can break many scenarios. In those cases, make 2 move actions before the 1st round instead.\n5. LIE LOW\n\nWhile this fighter is Prone, enemy fighters cannot target them with a ranged attack unless they are within the attacking weapon\u2019s Short range. Weapons that do not have a Short range are unaffected by this rule.\n6. OVERWATCH\n\nIf this fighter is Standing and Active, and has a Ready marker on them, they can interrupt a visible enemy model\u2019s action as soon as it is declared but before it is carried out. This fighter loses their Ready marker and then immediately makes a Shoot (Basic) action, targeting the enemy whose action they have interrupted. If the enemy is Prone and Pinned or Seriously Injured as a result, their activation ends immediately and their action(s) are not made.\nDRIVING\n\n1. JINK\n\nOnce per round, when their vehicle is hit by an attack, this crew may attempt to make a special Jink save which cannot be modified by a weapon\u2019s Armour Piercing value. Roll a D6. On a roll of 6+, the crew\u2019s quick reactions enable them to jerk the controls and avoid the attack. The hit is ignored.\n2. EXPERT DRIVER\n\nWhen this crew\u2019s vehicle makes a Loss of Control test, add 1 to the result.\n3. HEAVY FOOT\n\nOnce per round, when this crew\u2019s vehicle performs either a Move (Simple) or a Ram (Double) action, the vehicle may increase its Movement characteristic by D3\". However, doing so is not without risks. If a natural 1 is rolled, the vehicle suffers a single Glancing Hit to its Engine.\n4. SLALOM\n\nOnce per round, when this crew\u2019s vehicle performs a Move (Simple) action, it may make an additional turn of up to 45\u00b0 at any point before, during or after its move.\n5. T-BONE\n\nIf this crew\u2019s vehicle has a Head-on Collision with another vehicle or terrain feature, this vehicle may add D3 to its Front Toughness characteristic until the collision is fully resolved.\n6. RUNNING REPAIRS\n\nIf, when making a Handling test to Restart this crew\u2019s vehicle whilst it is Stationary and Stalled, a natural 6 is rolled, this driver has not only Restarted the vehicle but repaired some minor damage. The vehicle regains one lost Hull Point.\nFEROCITY\n\n1. BERSERKER\n\nWhen this fighter makes close combat attacks as part of a Charge (Double) action, they roll one additional Attack dice.\n2. FEARSOME\n\nIf an enemy wishes to make a Charge (Double) action that would result in them making one or more close combat attacks against this fighter, they must make a Willpower test before moving. If the test is failed, they cannot move and their activation ends immediately.\n3. IMPETUOUS\n\nWhen this fighter consolidates at the end of a close combat, they may move up to 4\", rather than the usual 2\".\nOPTIONAL HOUSE RULE\nIf eligible, can both Coup de Grace and Consolidate (2\") after a Fight action.\n4.",

NERVES OF STEEL\n\nWhen the fighter is hit by a ranged attack, make a Cool test for them. If it is passed, they may choose not to become Prone and Pinned.\n5. TRUE GRIT\n\nWhen making an Injury roll for this fighter, roll one less Injury dice (for example, a Damage 2 weapon would roll one dice). Against attacks with Damage 1, roll two dice \u2013 the player controlling the fighter with True Grit can then choose one dice to discard before the effects of the other are resolved.\n6.

In some cases a low number is better, but in other cases, a high number is better:\nMovement (M), Toughness (Front, Side and Rear) and Hull Points (HP) are all shown as simple numbers, in which case a higher number is better.\nSave (Sv), Ballistic Skill (BS) and Handling (Hnd) are all shown as target numbers; a number followed by a \u2018+\u2019 symbol, as described in\u00a0\nRolling Dice\n.

This shows how sturdily built a vehicle is; the higher a vehicle\u2019s Toughness characteristic, the less likely it is to be damaged by an attack.\nHULL POINTS (HP)\n\nA vehicle\u2019s Hull Points characteristic is a measure of how much punishment it can sustain before it is Wrecked.\nHANDLING (HND)\n\nThis represents how manoeuvrable a vehicle is and how responsive it is to the crew\u2019s commands. Handling is used to avoid damage from dangerous terrain, maintain control after suffering damage, and when attempting to Restart a Stalled vehicle.\nSAVE (SV)\n\nThis indicates how heavily armoured a vehicle is.\nBALLISTIC SKILL (BS)\n\nThis characteristic represents the proficiency of the vehicle\u2019s crew with ranged weapons fitted to the vehicle.\nLEADERSHIP (LD)\n\nA vehicle\u2019s Leadership characteristic represents the ability of its crew to issue or follow commands in the heat of battle.\nCOOL (CL)\n\nA vehicle\u2019s Cool characteristic represents the capacity of its crew for keeping calm under fire.\nWILLPOWER (WIL)\n\nWillpower is a measure of the crew\u2019s mental fortitude and resilience against the horrors of Necromunda.\nINTELLIGENCE (INT)\n\nThis represents the mental acuity and ability of the crew to apply knowledge.\nMODIFYING CHARACTERISTICS\n\nSometimes, the rules will modify a characteristic. If the characteristic is given as a simple number, the modifier is applied as written \u2013 for example, if a vehicle with a Front Toughness of 6 is given a +1 modifier to its Toughness, its Front Toughness counts as 7.\nIf the characteristic is given as a target number (for example, a characteristic of 4+ means a dice roll of 4 or higher would be a success), the modifier is applied to the dice roll rather than the characteristic.\nCHARACTERISTIC TESTS\n\nPlayers will often be called on to make a characteristic test for a vehicle \u2013 for example, a Ballistic Skill test is made when a vehicle attacks with a ranged weapon.

The higher a fighter\u2019s Strength characteristic, the more likely they are to inflict damage on an opponent in close combat, for example.\nTOUGHNESS (T)\n\nThis represents how tough the fighter is. The higher a fighter\u2019s Toughness characteristic, the less likely they are to be wounded by an attack.\nWOUNDS (W)\n\nA fighter\u2019s Wounds characteristic is a measure of how much punishment they can take before succumbing to their injuries.\nINITIATIVE (I)\n\nA fighter\u2019s Initiative characteristic provides a measure of their agility and dexterity, and the quickness of their reflexes.\nATTACKS (A)\n\nThis is a measure of a fighter\u2019s speed and ability in melee. When a fighter is engaged in close combat, their Attacks characteristic determines how many dice are rolled, with each dice representing one attack made against their enemies.\nLEADERSHIP (LD)\n\nA fighter\u2019s Leadership characteristic represents their ability to issue or follow commands in the heat of battle.\nCOOL (CL)\n\nA fighter\u2019s Cool characteristic represents their capacity for keeping calm under fire.\nWILLPOWER (WIL)\n\nWillpower is a measure of a fighter\u2019s mental fortitude and resilience against the horrors of Necromunda.\nINTELLIGENCE (INT)\n\nThis represents a fighter\u2019s mental acuity and ability to apply knowledge.\nMODIFYING CHARACTERISTICS\n\nSometimes, the rules will modify a characteristic.

For example, if a fighter with Initiative 4+ is given a +1 Initiative modifier, the characteristic would be 3+ because a roll of 3 with a +1 modifier applied becomes a roll of 4.\nCHARACTERISTIC TESTS\n\nPlayers will often be called on to make a characteristic test for a fighter \u2013 for example, a Ballistic Skill test is made when a fighter attacks with a ranged weapon.

Nothing yet created by the Noble Houses compares to the damage faith has done to their people, and nothing in the entire hive world unites its inhabitants so surely. Even the fear of Lord Helmawr and the Imperial House cannot compete with true faith, and it is in this that House Cawdor\u2019s power lies. All the other Clan Houses and Noble Houses are built upon alliances, the exchange of wealth, and obligation; their roots tied inexplicably to the industry of the hive world. Though House Cawdor shares in this industry, it is not defined by it. Rather, where most count credits each cycle to measure the worth of their subjects, the people of Clan Cawdor consider themselves strong so long as their faith remains strong. This has saved Cawdor from extinction where so many other Clan Houses have succumbed to the march of time or the ebb and flow of production quotas. For even while Cawdor languishes beneath its peers in terms of wealth and military might, it has never been poor in its beliefs.\nFrom the outside, other Necromundans see House Cawdor as bonepickers, scavengers and beggars, little better than the hive rats that plague their holesteads. Only the mantle of being born of a Clan House elevates them above the clanless masses or the serf class, though most self-respecting subjects of Lord Helmawr will not deal with them. However, they do perform a vital role within hive society, picking through the refuse and cast-offs of the factoria, so that nothing might go to waste. If this were the only thing they were known for, Clan Cawdor might be better accepted by their peers. As it is, few can think of the Clan House without thinking of the faith that drives them. And they are not mistaken in this belief, for on Necromunda, Clan Cawdor and the Redemptionist faith are one and the same.\n\n\nCAWDOR FIGHTERS\n\n\n90CREDITS\nFIREBRAND (CHAMPION)\n\n\n\nSkills:\n\u00a01 Primary (custom).\nRestrictions:\n\u00a0None.\nSpecial Rules:\n\u00a0Gang Hierarchy (Champion), Tools of the Trade, Group Activation (1), Pious, Righteous Warrior.\nRIGHTEOUS WARRIOR\n\nOnce per battle, can re-roll a Threshold test to perform an Act of Faith (all dice must be re-rolled).\nFirebrands are the righteous right hand of the Word-Keepers and ever ready to dispense holy justice in the name of the faith.

        "83e41d32-3a97-4b12-ba31-359c0abde7b9": "TERRAIN\nSource: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)\nTerrain plays a vitally important role in Necromunda. Not only does it provide a dense and challenging battlefield for gangs to fight over, but it also instils battles with the character of the world in which those gangs exist.\nHow terrain can impact the game and the rules governing specific terrain features will be presented elsewhere within this book. For example, the ways in which terrain can hamper movement is dealt with in the Movement section. There are, however, a few features that should be dealt with here as general principles.\nImpassable Terrain:\n\u00a0Any terrain can be designated impassable when setting up the battlefield, regardless of size. Impassable terrain may include solid sections of wall, vertiginous rock formations or towering vats of molten metal. Impassable terrain cannot, as the name suggests, be moved through or over.\nWalls:\n\u00a0Walls are almost always considered impassable terrain. On a battlefield of only one level, it is assumed that at the top of each wall sits a ceiling, preventing fighters from climbing over a wall. However, on a battlefield that covers multiple levels, featuring ladders, staircases and even lifts, it is possible for fighters to scale and even climb over walls.\nSolid Terrain Features:\n\u00a0Particularly solid terrain features are treated similarly to walls. Any terrain designated as solid when setting up the battlefield is considered impassable, as described above.\nDoors:\n\u00a0These come in various sizes, but their rules are the same regardless of size \u2013 they are set up as part of the pre-battle sequence. By default, all doors are closed at the start of a battle, unless a scenario specifies otherwise. Closed doors are considered impassable terrain. They cannot be moved through and block both line of sight and measurement in the same way as walls and solid terrain as described previously.\nAny fighter may open a closed door or close an open door by performing an\u00a0\nOperate Door (Simple)\n\u00a0action during their activation. If a door opens or closes within 1\" of a\u00a0\nbooby trap\n, it may be triggered.\nClosed doors, locked or otherwise, can be targeted by attacks and are automatically hit. All doors have a Toughness of 5 and 4 Wounds; if a door is reduced to 0 Wounds, it is removed from the battlefield.\nLocked Doors & Terminals:\n\u00a0When a door is set up during the pre-battle sequence, two door terminals may be placed, one on either side of the door, touching the wall within 1\" of it. The presence of a door terminal indicates that the door is locked and very secure indeed!\nA fighter cannot perform an Operate Door (Simple) action against a locked door. Instead, they must perform an\u00a0\nAccess Terminal (Basic)\n\u00a0action or a\u00a0\nForce Door (Basic)\n\u00a0action in order to unlock the door. Once a locked door has been opened in this way, it remains unlocked for the remainder of the battle.\nIn a scenario where one gang is the attacker and the other gang the defender, the defender is assumed to have the access codes for any locked doors, and can make an Operate Door (Simple) action on themas normal.\nObstacles & Structures:\n\u00a0Obstacles are any free standing terrain features measuring no more than 2\" high and no more than 2\" across, although they may be far longer, such as barricades, barrels and pipelines.\nStructures are any terrain features measuring more than 2\" high or more than 2\" across, be they free standing or connected to other terrain features in some way. Structures may feature many different levels, platforms and walkways on which fighters may be placed. Structures may be further classified as being \u2018sturdy\u2019 or \u2018flimsy\u2019. Sturdy structures cannot be knocked down by vehicles (see\u00a0\nVehicle Impacts: Colliding With Terrain\n).\nBoth obstacles and structures may interrupt line of sight and offer cover to models as described previously and in the shooting rules.\nFighters may climb over obstacles or up onto structures as described in the Movement rules, but players should be aware that movement may be reduced or not possible in some cases.\nLast updated\u00a0on",
        "952094b1-1cb9-4821-855b-8829e7a1b0a0": "LINE OF SIGHT & COVER\nSource: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)\nVisibility in Necromunda is vitally important; fighters need to be able to see where their enemies are in order to shoot at them. But in the dense and dark terrain of the underhive, or within the thick clouds of dust and pollution that hang over the ash wastes, a clear and unobstructed line of sight is often hard to find.\nFIGHTER VISION ARCS\n\nEach fighter has a vision arc, representing the area that is visible to them. This is 90\u00b0 to the front of the model \u2013 as determined by the direction the model\u2019s head is facing or the direction in which its weapon is pointed, whichever the controlling player prefers \u2013 starting from the centre of their base, as shown in the diagram below. As mentioned previously, Vision Arc templates can be used to help determine the extent of a fighter\u2019s vision arc.\n\nVEHICLE VISION ARCS\n\nLike fighters, vehicles have vision arcs. Where they differ is that larger vehicles with more crew may have up to four vision arcs, as shown on the following diagram. All vehicles have a front vision arc, representing what the crew can see in the moment. Those with more than one vision arc will invariably also have crewed weapons that face into that vision arc. Where a vehicle does not have a certain vision arc, this is known as a \u2018blind spot\u2019. Determine a vehicle\u2019s vision arc by drawing two imaginary lines through the corners of the vehicle as shown below.\n\nLINE OF SIGHT\n\nWhile a model\u2019s vision arc is determined by their facing, their line of sight (i.e., what they can see) is determined by the presence of terrain and other models. Unlike measuring distances, which can only be done when the rules call for it, a model\u2019s line of sight can be checked at any time.\nTo check one model\u2019s line of sight to another model, stoop down to look from the first model\u2019s point of view:\nIf a straight, uninterrupted line can be drawn fromwithin the first model\u2019s vision arc to any part of the other model*, the first model has a line of sight to them.\nIf no such line can be drawn to the other model due to intervening terrain or the presence of other models*, the first model does not have a line of sight to them.\nExcluding their base or any insignificant elements, such as a protruding hairstyle, the barrel of a gun or a spike from their armour, for example.\nIf players cannot agree whether one model has a line of sight to another, it should be settled by rolling off.\nLINE OF SIGHT & SOLID TERRAIN FEATURES\n\nSolid terrain such as the walls between corridors, the floors and ceilings between levels, or large rock formations looming up from the landscape are, by their nature, impossible to see through. Unless stated, a line of sight can never be drawn through any terrain feature defined as being solid.\nDESIGNER'S NOTE\nAGREEING ON LINE OF SIGHT\n\nIt pays to be gracious when your opponent claims line of sight \u2013 in other words, if they claim their model has line of sight and your immediate thought is anything less than \u201cThere is no way that model has line of sight!\u201d, we recommend allowing it. If both players take this approach (with both line of sight and cover), the game will flow more smoothly and will be much more satisfying.\nCOVER\n\nIn the majority of cases, the line of sight between one model and another will be checked for the purposes of shooting and, in many cases, a model that wishes to shoot at an enemy model may be able to draw a line of sight only to part of their intended target.\nTo see if a target is in cover, stoop down to look from the attacker\u2019s point of view, in exactly the same manner as described for checking line of sight. However, when checking to see if the target is in cover, disregard any friendly fighters in base contact with the attacker \u2013 moving them aside temporarily if necessary, as long as they return to the original place (and facing) once the shot has been resolved (note that vehicles in base contact will still block line of sight):\nIf the target is fully visible, they are not in cover (i.e., they are \u2018in the open\u2019).\nIf less than half of the target is obscured by terrain or models, they are in partial cover.\nIf at least half of the target is obscured by terrain or models, they are in full cover.\nAs with line of sight, ignore the target\u2019s base and any minor elements such as hair, gun barrels and spikes \u2013 and again, if a decision cannot be reached, the players should roll off.",

Even though their base is obscured, a clear, unobstructed line of sight can easily be drawn to them. They are not in cover.\nTIP\n\nThe second example shows a fighter in partial cover.

Distances can only be measured when the rules call for it (for example, when checking the range between an attacking fighter and their target) \u2013 on Necromunda, there are very few certainties! Therefore, pre- measuring distances when making any kind of action is not allowed \u2013 declare the action and nominate any other models involved before range is measured.\nDistances between models and any other battlefield objects (terrain features, objectives and so forth) are measured from the closest point of one base to the closest point of the other. If a model or an object does not have a base, measure to or from the closest point of the model or object overall.\nWhen measuring to or from a Prone fighter, assume that their base occupies the same space as it would if they were Standing, as shown in the diagram below:\n\nMEASUREMENT & SOLID TERRAIN FEATURES\n\nSome terrain features such as the thick walls that separate corridors, the floors and ceilings that separate levels, or large rock formations looming up from the landscape are defined by the rules as \u2018solid\u2019.

        "72a98897-6d48-4f84-abf0-f84670446bca": "WEAPON TRAITS\nSource: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)\nThe following list contains all of the Weapon Traits in full.\nASSAULT SHIELD/ENERGY SHIELD\n\nAn assault/energy shield grants a +2 armour save modifier (to a maximum of 2+) against melee attacks that originate from within the fighter\u2019s vision arc (the 90\u00b0 arc to their front), and a +1 armour save modifier against ranged attacks that originate from within the fighter\u2019s vision arc; check this before the fighter is placed Prone and is Pinned. If it is not clear whether the attacker is within the target\u2019s Front arc, use a Vision Arc template to check \u2013 if the centre of the attacker\u2019s base is within the arc, the assault/energy shield can be used. Against attacks with the Blast trait, use the centre of the Blast marker in place of the attacker. If the target does not have a facing (for example, if they are Prone), the assault/energy shield cannot be used.\nBACKSTAB\n\nIf the attacker is not within the target\u2019s vision arc, add 1 to the attack\u2019s Strength.\nBLAST(3\"/5\"/*)\n\nThe weapon utilises a\u00a0\nBlast marker\n.\nBLAZE\n\nAfter an attack with the Blaze trait has been resolved, roll a D6 if the target was hit but not taken Out of Action or Wrecked. On a 4+, they become subject to the\u00a0\nBlaze condition\n.\nYAQ\nInorganic targets are not affected.\nBURROWING\n\nBurrowing weapons can be fired at targets outside of the firer\u2019s line of sight. When firing at a target outside of line of sight do not make an attack roll, instead place the 3\" Blast marker anywhere on the battlefield, then move it 2D6\" in a direction determined by the Scatter dice. If a Hit is rolled on the Scatter dice, the Blast marker does not move. At the start of the End phase of the round in which this weapon was fired, before step 1, any fighters touched by the marker are hit by the weapon.\nNote that this Blast marker can move through impassable terrain such as walls and may move off the battlefield. If the Blast marker does move off the battlefield, the attack will have no effect. Burrowing weapons are capable of digging through several levels of wall and flooring, and can be used regardless of where the fighter is positioned on the battlefield.\nCHEM DELIVERY\n\nWhen a weapon with the Chem Delivery trait is used, the fighter declares what kind of chem they are firing at the target. This can be any chem the fighter is equipped with (note that firing the weapon does not cost a dose of the chem and that friendly fighters cannot be targeted), or if the weapon also has the Toxin or Gas trait, the fighter can use these Traits instead. Instead of making a Wound roll for a Chem Delivery attack, roll a D6. If the result is equal to or higher than the target\u2019s Toughness, or is a natural 6, the target is affected by the chosen chem just as if they had taken a dose. If the roll is lower than the target\u2019s Toughness, they shrug off the chem\u2019s effects.\nCOMBI\n\nA combi-weapon has two profiles. When it is fired, pick one of the two profiles and use it for the attack. Due to the compact nature of these weapons, they often have less capacity for ammunition, and are prone to jamming and other minor issues. When making an Ammo test for either of the weapons, roll twice and apply the worst result. However, unlike most weapons that have two profiles, ammo for the two parts of the combiweapon are tracked separately \u2013 if one profile runs Out of Ammo, the other can still fire unless it has also run Out of Ammo.\nCONCUSSION\n\nAny fighter hit by a Concussion weapon will have their Initiative reduced by 2, to a minimum of 6+, until the end of the round. Any vehicle hit by a Concussion weapon will suffer a -2 penalty to all Handling tests until the end of the round.\nCREW OPERATED\n\n^Missing from the 2023 Core Rules\nThis Trait indicates that a weapon fitted to a vehicleisoperated by the crew of the vehicle. This weaponmaybe used during the vehicle\u2019s activation. It uses theBScharacteristic of the vehicle\u2019s crew. In addition, theUnwieldy trait has no effect on this weapon.\nCURSED\n\nA fighter hit by a weapon with the Cursed trait must pass a Willpower test or gain the\u00a0\nInsane condition\n.",

In addition, theUnwieldy trait has no effect on this weapon.\nCURSED\n\nA fighter hit by a weapon with the Cursed trait must pass a Willpower test or gain the\u00a0\nInsane condition\n.\nDEMOLITIONS\n\nGrenades with the Demolitions trait can be used when making close combat attacks against scenery targets (such as locked doors or scenario objectives). A fighter who uses a grenade in this way makes one attack (regardless of how many Attack dice they would normally roll), which hits automatically.\nDIGI\n\nA Digi weapon is usually worn mounted on a ring or hidden inside a glove. It can be used in addition to any other Melee weapon carried by the fighter, granting an additional close combat attack. A weapon with this Trait does not count towards the maximum number of weapons a fighter can carry. However, the maximum number of weapons with this Trait a fighter can carry is 10.\nDISARM\n\nIf the hit roll for an attack made with a Disarm weapon is a natural 6, the target cannot use any weapons when making Reaction attacks for the remainder of that round \u2013 they make unarmed attacks instead.\nDRAG\n\nIf a fighter is hit by a Drag weapon but not taken Out of Action, the attacker can attempt to drag the target closer after the attack has been resolved. If they do, roll a D6. If the score is equal to or higher than the target\u2019s Strength, the target is dragged D3\" straight towards the attacker, stopping if they hit any terrain. If they move into another fighter (other than the attacker), both fighters are moved the remaining distance towards the attacker. If the weapon also has the Impale special rule and hits more than one fighter, only the last fighter to be hit can be dragged.\nENTANGLE\n\nHits scored by weapons with the Entangle trait cannot be negated by the Parry trait. In addition, if the hit roll for an Entangle weapon is a natural 6, any Reaction attacks made by the target have an additional -2 hit modifier.\nESOTERIC\n\nAn Esoteric weapon does not conform to standard Imperial patterns or fittings, as such they may never be given any Weapon Accessories, upgraded or modified in any way.\nEXCLUSIVE\n\nAn Exclusive weapon cannot be purchased from the Trading Post, a gang may only purchase it if it appears on their gang equipment lists.\nFEAR\n\nIf this attack would result in an Injury roll being made for any reason, no Injury roll is made and instead the opposing player makes a Nerve test for the target, subtracting 2 from the result. If the test fails, the target is immediately Broken and runs for cover.\nFLARE\n\nA model hit by a weapon with the Flare trait, or who is touched by a Blast marker fired from a weapon with the Flare trait, is Revealed if the battlefield is in darkness (see\u00a0\nPitch Black\n). If a weapon has both the Flare trait and the Blast (X\") trait, after determining where the Blast marker ends up, leave it in place. In the End phase, roll a D6. On a 4+, the flare goes out and the marker is removed, otherwise it remains in play. While the Blast marker is on the battlefield, all models touched by it are Revealed.\nFLASH\n\nIf a model is hit by a weapon with the Flash trait, no wound roll is made. Instead, if the target is a fighter they must make an Initiative test, and if they are a vehicle they must make a Handling test. If the test is failed, they become subject to the Blind condition. A Blind model loses their Ready marker; if they do not have a Ready marker, they do not gain a Ready marker at the start of the following round. Until the next time the model is activated, they cannot make any attacks other than Reaction attacks, for which any hit rolls will only succeed on a natural 6.\nFORCE\n\nIn the hands of a non-psyker a Force Weapon has no additional effects. However, when wielded by a fighter with either the Sanctioned Psyker or Non-sanctioned Psyker special rule, the weapon gains both the Power and Sever traits.",

However, when wielded by a fighter with either the Sanctioned Psyker or Non-sanctioned Psyker special rule, the weapon gains both the Power and Sever traits.\nGAS\n\nWhen a fighter is hit by an attack made by a weapon with the Gas trait, they do not become Prone and Pinned and a wound roll is not made. Instead, roll a D6. If the result is equal to or higher than the target\u2019s Toughness, or is a natural 6, make an Injury roll for them (regardless of their Wounds characteristic). Otherwise, they shrug off the effects of the gas. No save roll can be made against a weapon with this Trait.\nWhen a vehicle is hit by an attack made by a weapon with the Gas trait a wound roll is not made. Instead, roll a D6. If the result is equal to or higher than the target\u2019s rear Toughness, or is a natural 6, they suffer a Driver Wounded result on the Crew Damage table. If the roll is lower than the target\u2019s Toughness, they shrug off the effects of the gas. No save roll can be made against a weapon with this Trait.\nGRAVITON PULSE\n\nInstead of rolling to wound normally with this weapon, any fighter caught in the Blast must instead roll equal to or under their Strength on a D6 (a roll of 6 always counts as a fail), or suffer Damage with no armour save allowed; any vehicle caught in the Blast must instead roll equal or over the Toughness value of the facing hit on a D6 (a roll of a 6 always counts as a success), or suffer a hit to the Body with no armour save allowed. After the weapon has been fired, leave the Blast marker in place. For the remainder of the round, any model moving through this area will use 2\" of their Movement for every 1\" they move (note this affects all vehicles regardless of their Locomotive special rule). Remove the Blast marker during the End phase.\nGRENADE\n\nDespite being Wargear, grenades are treated as a special type of ranged weapon. A fighter equipped with grenades can throw one as a Shoot (Basic) action. Grenades do not have a Short range, and their Long range is determined by multiplying the fighter\u2019s Strength by the amount shown.\nA fighter can only carry a limited number of grenades. The Firepower dice does not need to be rolled when attacking with a grenade. Instead, after the attack has been resolved, it is assumed that the Ammo symbol has been rolled and an Ammo test is made automatically. If this is failed, grenades cannot be reloaded; the fighter has run out of that type of grenade and cannot use them for the remainder of the battle.\nHEXAGRAMMATIC\n\nThe ammo used by this weapon has been specially treated to defeat psychic defences and severely harm Psykers. Hits from weapons with this Trait ignore saves provided by psychic powers. Additionally, weapons with this Trait will inflict double damage against Psykers.\nIMPALE\n\nIf an attack made by this weapon hits a fighter and wounds the target, and the save roll is unsuccessful (or no save roll is made), the projectile continues through them and might hit another model! Trace a straight line from the target, directly away from the attacker. If there are any models within 1\" of this line, and within the weapon\u2019s Long range, the one that is closest to the target is at risk of being hit. Roll a D6. On a 3 or more, resolve the weapon\u2019s attack against that model, subtracting 1 from the Strength. The projectile can continue through multiple fighters in this way, but if the Strength is reduced to 0, it cannot hit any more models.\nKNOCKBACK\n\nWhen a weapon with the Knockback trait hits a fighter, if the hit roll is equal to or higher than the target\u2019s Strength, they are immediately moved 1\" directly away from the attacking model.",
        "72b7a201-a860-47a3-b896-6a587d04b2f4": "Trace a straight line from the target, directly away from the attacker.

The projectile can continue through multiple fighters in this way, but if the Strength is reduced to 0, it cannot hit any more models.\nKNOCKBACK\n\nWhen a weapon with the Knockback trait hits a fighter, if the hit roll is equal to or higher than the target\u2019s Strength, they are immediately moved 1\" directly away from the attacking model. If the fighter cannot be moved the full 1\" because of impassable terrain or another model, they move as far as possible and the attack\u2019s Damage is increased by 1. If a Blast weapon has the Knockback trait, roll a D6 for each fighter that is hit. If the result is equal to or higher than their Strength, they are knocked back as described above \u2013 however, they are moved directly away from the centre of the Blast marker instead. If the centre of the Blast marker was over the centre of their base, roll a Scatter dice to determine which way they are moved. If a Melee weapon has the Knockback trait, the attacking fighter can choose to follow the target up, moving directly towards them after they have been knocked back to remain in base contact. If the attack was made across a barricade, the attacker cannot do this. If any part of the knocked back fighter\u2019s base crosses the edge of a platform, make an Initiative test. If this is failed, they will fall. If this is passed, they stop moving at the edge of the platform.\nLIMITED\n\nThis special rule is applied to some special ammo types which can be purchased for weapons.\nIf a weapon fails an Ammo test while using Limited ammo, they have run out \u2013 that ammo type is deleted from their Fighter or Vehicle card, and cannot be used again until more of that special ammo is purchased from the Trading Post.\nThis is in addition to the normal rules for the weapon running Out of Ammo. The weapon can still be reloaded as normal, using its remaining profile(s).\nYAQ\nOnly a single \u2018dose\u2019 of ammo can be carried per weapon. Reduce fighter\u2019s cost accordingly after the ammo is lost.\nMASTER-CRAFTED\n\nOnce per battle, a weapon with the Master-crafted trait may re-roll a single failed hit roll.\nMELEE\n\nThis weapon can be used during close combat attacks.\nMELTA\n\nIf a Short range attack from a weapon with this Trait reduces a fighter to 0 wounds, no Injury dice are rolled \u2013 instead, any Injury dice that would be rolled cause an automatic Out of Action result.\nIf a Short range attack from a weapon with this Trait wounds a vehicle, roll an additional Damage dice.\nIf a weapon with this Trait has no Short range, then the Trait applies to all attacks made by it.\nPAIRED\n\n^Missing from the 2023 Core Rules\nA fighter that is armed with Paired weapons counts as being armed with dual weapons with the Melee trait for the purposes of calculating the number of Attack dice they will roll. Additionally, when making a Charge (Double) action, their Attacks characteristic is doubled. Fighters subject to the Mounted condition gain no benefit from this Trait\nPARRY\n\nAfter an enemy makes close combat attacks against a fighter armed with a Parry weapon, the fighter can force the attacking player to re-roll one successful hit. If the fighter is armed with two Parry weapons, they can force the attacking player to re-roll two successful hits instead.\nPHASE\n\n^Missing from the 2023 Core Rules\nSave rolls granted by armour or field armour cannot bemade against a weapon with this Trait.

If the result is equal to or higher than the target\u2019s Toughness, or is a natural 6, they can change one Injury dice froma Flesh Wound result to a Serious Injury result, or if targeting a vehicle roll an additional Damage dice.\nRAD-PHAGE\n\nAfter fully resolving any successful hits a fighter suffers from a weapon with this Trait, roll an additional D6. On a 4+, the fighter will suffer an additional Flesh Wound.\nRAPID FIRE (X)\n\nWhen firing with a Rapid Fire weapon, a successful hit roll scores a number of hits equal to the number of bullet holes on the Firepower dice. In addition, the controlling player can roll more than one Firepower dice, up to the number shown in brackets (for example, when firing a Rapid Fire (2) weapon, up to two Firepower dice can be rolled). Make an Ammo test for each Ammo symbol that is rolled. If any of them fail, the gun runs Out of Ammo. If two or more of them fail, the gun has jammed and cannot be used for the rest of the battle.\nIf a Rapid Fire weapon scores more than one hit, the hits can be split between multiple targets. The first must be allocated to the original target, but the remainder can be allocated to other models within 3\" of the first who are also within range and line of sight. These must not be any harder to hit than the original target \u2013 if a target in the open is hit, an obscured target cannot have hits allocated to it. Allocate all of the hits before making any wound rolls.\nRECKLESS\n\nReckless weapons are indiscriminate in what they target:\nBefore making a ranged attack with a Reckless weapon, randomly determine the target of the attack from all eligible models (including friendly models) within this model\u2019s line of sight and range of the weapon.",

For example, here is the profile of a heavy stubber:\n\n\n\nINFO\nWeapon Profiles appear slightly differently on Necrodamus, for the sake of brevity.\n\n\nA weapon\u2019s characteristics are defined as follows:\nRANGE (RNG)\n\nEach weapon has two ranges: Short (S) and Long (L), usually presented as a number of inches. Weapons cannot hit models outside of their Long range. There may be other effects associated with an attack being within either the Long or Short range of a weapon, these will be described when they come up.\nSome weapon ranges are shown as a letter rather than a number of inches. If a weapon\u2019s range is listed as an \u2018E\u2019, it can only be used in close combat against targets that are Engaged with the wielder. If a weapon\u2019s range is \u2018T\u2019, it uses the\u00a0\nFlame template\n. Weapons with range E or T normally only have a Long range given, not a Short range, indicating that this is the furthest range at which the weapon can be used.\nACCURACY (ACC)\n\nThis shows the modifiers that are applied to the hit roll when attacking with the weapon within Short range or Long range. The \u2018S\u2019 modifier applies if the weapon is being used to attack a target within its Short range, and the \u2018L\u2019 modifier applies if the weapon is being used to attack a target beyond Short range but within Long range. Most such modifiers are positive, but some may be negative.\nSTRENGTH (STR)\n\nThis is the weapon\u2019s Strength, which is used when making wound rolls against the target. For most weapons, particularly ranged weapons, this is a simple number. For close combat weapons \u2013 those with a range of E \u2013 this may be shown as \u2018S\u2019, meaning the Strength of the wielder should be used, or as S with a modifier, meaning the Strength of the wielder is used but with a modifier applied.\nARMOUR PIERCING (AP)\n\nThis shows how good the weapon is at punching through a target\u2019s armour. This is a modifier which is applied to the dice rolled to make an armour save. Most often, this will be a negative modifier, but in some cases it may be a positive modifier or even a \u2018-\u2019 which denotes no modifier.\nDAMAGE (D)\n\nThis represents how much damage the weapon inflicts. This in turn indicates how many Wounds a fighter loses or how many Injury dice are rolled against them as a result of the attack. This is explained in more detail in\u00a0\nInflicting Damage\n. Against a vehicle it determines how many Damage dice are rolled. This is explained in more detail in\u00a0\nResolving Hits Aginst Vehicles: Making Wound Rolls\n.\nAMMO (AM)\n\nIf this characteristic is presented as a target number, a Firepower dice must be rolled as well as the hit dice when attacking with it, as there is a chance of it running Out of Ammo, jamming or otherwise malfunctioning. This is explained in more detail in\u00a0\nResolving Hits: The Firepower Dice\n.\nTRAITS\n\nMost weapons have one or more Traits, each of which gives the weapon a unique bonus or changes the way in which it works.\nAVAILABILITY LEVEL (AL)\n\nThis indicates how easily available a weapon is from the Trading Post, either Rare (R), Illegal (I) or Exclusive (E). This is explained in more detail in\u00a0\nThe Post-Battle Sequence: Visiting the Trading Post\n.\nCREDIT COST\n\nThis indicates how much it costs to purchase the weapon from the Trading Post.

Effectively, this should be able to represent areas of the battlefield and things like obstacles and elevation without having to draw out the entire map. It is okay to abstract this map as long as it is able to be included inside of a Markdown document.\n\n\tResponse\n\tCreating a text representation of a Necromunda battle map within a Markdown document can be achieved by using a combination of text, symbols, and Markdown formatting to represent different elements of the battlefield. This abstract representation can include areas, obstacles, and elevations. Here's a basic structure you can follow:\n\tText Representation of a Necromunda Battle Map\n\tLegend\n\tX\n\t = Obstacle (e.g., wall, barricade)\n\tO\n\t = Open space\n\t^\n\t = Higher elevation (e.g., upper floor, hill)\n\tv\n\t = Lower elevation (e.g., ditch, pit)\n\t#\n\t = Hazard (e.g., toxic pool, fire)\n\t@\n\t = Objective or point of interest\n\tMap\n\tX X X O O ^ ^ ^ O O X X X\nX X X O O ^ ^ ^ O O X X X\nO O O O O ^ ^ ^ O O O O O\nO O O # O ^ ^ ^ O # O O O\nv v v v v v v v v v v v v\nv v v v v @ v v v v v v v\nv v v v v v v v v v v v v\n\n\tNotes\n\tNorth is towards the top of the map.\n\tEach symbol represents a specific area or feature.\n\tElevation changes are indicated by \n\t^\n\t (up) and \n\tv\n\t (down).\n\tThe battlefield is divided into grid-like sections for easy reference.\n\tThis format allows for an easy-to-understand representation of the battlefield without the need for complex graphics. Players can refer to the map for positioning, cover, and movement strategies. The map can be expanded or modified as needed to fit different scenarios or battlefields.\n\tRemember, this is a simplified representation and may require adaptation for more complex battlefields or specific scenarios in Necromunda.\n\n\t\tDescription of the Sector Mechanicus Map\n\t\tThe map represents an industrial complex within the Sector Mechanicus, characterized by a mix of open areas, elevated walkways, and heavy machinery. The central feature of this battlefield is the series of conveyor belts (\n\t\t=\n\t\t) and large machinery (\n\t\t@\n\t\t), which likely contribute to the manufacturing or processing activities of the complex. The elevated walkways (\n\t\t^\n\t\t) provide strategic vantage points, overseeing the entire area and offering a tactical advantage for ranged combat.\n\t\tThe open spaces (\n\t\t.\n\t\t) suggest areas for maneuvering troops, setting up ambushes, or engaging in close-quarters combat. The ladders or stairs (\n\t\t|\n\t\t) indicate transitions between different levels, adding vertical complexity to the battlefield. The outer boundary (\n\t\tX\n\t\t) represents the solid walls of the complex, containing the battle within this industrial setting.\n\t\tScenario: \"The Mechanicum's Secret\"\n\t\tBackground\n\t\tA valuable piece of archeotech has been rumored to be hidden within an old, partially operational Sector Mechanicus complex. Gangs have converged on the location to claim this prize for themselves, navigating the treacherous industrial terrain to find the artifact.\n\t\tObjective\n\t\tEach gang aims to locate and secure the archeotech.",

Gangs have converged on the location to claim this prize for themselves, navigating the treacherous industrial terrain to find the artifact.\n\t\tObjective\n\t\tEach gang aims to locate and secure the archeotech. The first gang to reach the central area of the map (around the machinery \n\t\t@\n\t\t) and perform an action to retrieve the artifact wins the scenario.\n\t\tSpecial Rules\n\t\tConveyor Belts\n\t\t: The conveyor belts (\n\t\t=\n\t\t) move at the end of each round, potentially shifting any fighters or objects on them one space along their length.\n\t\tElevated Danger\n\t\t: Fighters on elevated walkways (\n\t\t^\n\t\t) gain an advantage in ranged combat but are at risk of falling if they fail an Initiative test when hit.\n\t\tIndustrial Hazards\n\t\t: Certain areas near the machinery (\n\t\t@\n\t\t) are hazardous. Fighters ending their turn in these zones must roll to avoid taking damage.\n\t\tLimited Visibility\n\t\t: The dense machinery and industrial fog reduce visibility. Long-range shooting is more difficult, encouraging close combat and sneaking.\n\t\tRetrieval Action\n\t\t: To retrieve the archeotech, a fighter must be adjacent to the central machinery and spend a full turn uninterrupted to secure the item.\n\t\tSetup\n\t\tGangs start at opposite ends of the map, outside the complex (\n\t\tX\n\t\t boundary). The game progresses in rounds until one gang successfully retrieves the archeotech or all opposing gang fighters are out of action.\n\t\tThis scenario emphasizes strategic movement, control of key areas, and balancing the pursuit of the objective with combat challenges.\n\n\t\tX X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X\nX @ @ = = @ @ . . . . . . . . = = @ @ X\nX @ @ = = @ @ . . . . . . . . = = @ @ X\nX X X X X X . . . . . . . . .

Their use varies depending upon need, with many serving a purely decorative or ritual purpose, bearing censers or holy icons during the endless sermons of the Ecclesiarchy. Others carry small items for those they serve or, in some cases, operate machinery high in the domes and rafters of shrines and cathedrals.\nThe Orders Militant and Frateris Militia are often accompanied to war by cherubservitors. Here they fulfil a number of roles, from porting ammunition and wargear to acting as a form of mobile cover or ablative armour, protecting those they serve by sacrificing their own vat-grown bodies. It is not uncommon to see well-funded Redemptionists similarly accompanied by cherub-servitors. How these criminal rabble rousers come into possession of such companions is something of a mystery, suggesting links to Noble Houses, and even sects within the Ecclesiarchy itself.\n35CREDITS\nREDEMPTIONIST ROAD PREACHER (CREW)\n\n\n\nRestrictions:\n\u00a0Pistol.\nSpecial Rules:\n\u00a0Gang Fighter (Crew), Vehicle Crew, Fanatical, One of the Faithful.\nVEHICLE CREW\n\nA Cawdor Road Preacher must always be equipped with a vehicle.\nFANATICAL\n\nA zealous follower of Redemptionist teachings, this model embodies the extreme beliefs of their cult, embracing the path of the fanatic.

Such deformities of the body are clear evidence, so their leaders tell them, of the corruption that lurks within the soul. How can anyone who lives their life in loyalty to the Emperor, anyone who dedicates their every action to his glory, their every moment of toil to the betterment of his Imperium, ever become so corrupt and debased of form? Physical abnormalities are clear evidence, then, that those afflicted have turned their gaze away from his light and shunned Him as their one true master, and so the devout of House Cawdor will hunt them down and exterminate such affronts to Him on Terra with great prejudice, wherever they attempt to hide from his light.\nAnd yet, exceptions not only exist within the teeming ranks of House Cawdor, but could even be called\u2026 common. Many denizens of Cawdor are lame of body or weak of wit. Many are abnormally large or strangely proportioned and peculiar to behold. How it is that such variation from the accepted baseline norm of humanity can be tolerated within a House that claims to despise such variations is something of a mystery, but to the Cawdor themselves the answer is simply one of faith. If their leaders choose to allow these souls to live, then live they will, just like any other Cawdor, dedicating their lives to the holy cause. A common sight amongst the peoples of House Cawdor is that of the physically frail and the weak of mind coexisting, working together to do for one another that which they cannot do alone. Sometimes regarded as bearers of stigma, sometimes called \u2018stigs\u2019 amongst the gangs of House Cawdor, but never \u2018mutants\u2019, lest the speaker wish to provoke a violent reaction, these combinations of shambling, slack-jawed behemoth and shrewd-yet-wizened rider can be a great asset to any Cawdor gang seeking to establish dominance in the underhive.\nTruly, House Cawdor is home to some strange sights indeed!\nSKILL ACCESS\n\nCAWDOR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nREDEMPTIONIST\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOTHER\n\n\n\n\n\nDEVOUT MASSES\n\nExtra Faction fighters (not Redemptionists) can be added to the Crew at the start of any battle (this can take the Crew beyond the size specified by the scenario):\n+1 Ganger.\n+D3 Juves.\n\nCAWDOR EQUIPMENT LIST\nLegend\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBASIC WEAPONS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPISTOLS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSPECIAL WEAPONS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHEAVY WEAPONS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCLOSE COMBAT WEAPONS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGRENADES\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nARMOUR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFIELD ARMOUR\n\n\n\n\n\nEQUIPMENT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPETS (STATUS ITEM)\n\n\n\n\n\nSERVO SKULLS (STATUS ITEM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWEAPON ACCESSORIES",

Such deformities of the body are clear evidence, so their leaders tell them, of the corruption that lurks within the soul. How can anyone who lives their life in loyalty to the Emperor, anyone who dedicates their every action to his glory, their every moment of toil to the betterment of his Imperium, ever become so corrupt and debased of form? Physical abnormalities are clear evidence, then, that those afflicted have turned their gaze away from his light and shunned Him as their one true master, and so the devout of House Cawdor will hunt them down and exterminate such affronts to Him on Terra with great prejudice, wherever they attempt to hide from his light.\n\tAnd yet, exceptions not only exist within the teeming ranks of House Cawdor, but could even be called\u2026 common. Many denizens of Cawdor are lame of body or weak of wit. Many are abnormally large or strangely proportioned and peculiar to behold. How it is that such variation from the accepted baseline norm of humanity can be tolerated within a House that claims to despise such variations is something of a mystery, but to the Cawdor themselves the answer is simply one of faith. If their leaders choose to allow these souls to live, then live they will, just like any other Cawdor, dedicating their lives to the holy cause. A common sight amongst the peoples of House Cawdor is that of the physically frail and the weak of mind coexisting, working together to do for one another that which they cannot do alone. Sometimes regarded as bearers of stigma, sometimes called \u2018stigs\u2019 amongst the gangs of House Cawdor, but never \u2018mutants\u2019, lest the speaker wish to provoke a violent reaction, these combinations of shambling, slack-jawed behemoth and shrewd-yet-wizened rider can be a great asset to any Cawdor gang seeking to establish dominance in the underhive.\n\tTruly, House Cawdor is home to some strange sights indeed!\n\tSKILL ACCESS\n\t\n\tCAWDOR\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tREDEMPTIONIST\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tOTHER\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\tDEVOUT MASSES\n\t\n\tExtra Faction fighters (not Redemptionists) can be added to the Crew at the start of any battle (this can take the Crew beyond the size specified by the scenario):\n\t+1 Ganger.\n\t+D3 Juves.\n\n\tCAWDOR EQUIPMENT LIST\n\tLegend\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tBASIC WEAPONS\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tPISTOLS\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tSPECIAL WEAPONS\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tHEAVY WEAPONS\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\tCLOSE COMBAT WEAPONS\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tGRENADES\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tARMOUR\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tFIELD ARMOUR\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\tEQUIPMENT\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tPETS (STATUS ITEM)\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\tSERVO SKULLS (STATUS ITEM)\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\tWEAPON ACCESSORIES",

        "64cc4351-da95-4e67-bdbb-c976859476a2": "GPT Builder\nWelcome back! Is there anything NecromundaGPT should be doing better? Anything you'd like to change?\n\nYou\nRefer to the following for dice rules:\n\nROLLING DICE\nA game of Necromunda uses dice rolls a great deal. The roll of a dice determines everything, be it a fighter\u2019s ability to keep their cool in the heat of battle, or the effectiveness of a shot fired from a lasgun. Throughout the rules, players will encounter certain terms that relate to the rolling of dice.\n\nSINGLE DICE ROLLS\nThe rules will often require a player to roll a single dice, in which case the rules will state quite simply \u2018roll a D6\u2019. Sometimes the rules might require several single dice to be rolled at once, for example, \u2018roll three D6\u2019 means three dice are rolled together, but the result of each dice is considered separately.\n\nMULTIPLE DICE ROLLS\nOften the rules will require a player to roll multiple D6s and add the results together. For example, the rules might instruct a player to \u2018roll 2D6\u2019. In such cases, two D6 are rolled and the results added together to give a total between 2 and 12. This is a multiple dice roll.\n\nDICE POOLS\nSometimes the game may require two or more dice be rolled and a single result selected \u2013 for example, a player might roll two or three Location dice and select one result to apply. In this case a \u2018pool\u2019 of dice has been rolled.\n\nTARGET NUMBER ROLLS\nUsually, when making a single dice roll or a multiple dice roll, the rules will require a player to roll a specific number followed by a \u2018+\u2019. This indicates that the roll is a \u2018target number roll\u2019. Making a target number roll is simple. If a player is required to roll a 4+ on a single D6, for example, a roll of 4, 5 or 6 would be a success, but a roll of 1, 2 or 3 would not be.\n\nMODIFYING DICE ROLLS\nThe rules will often call for a dice roll to be modified, particularly when making a target number roll. To do this, simply roll the dice and then add or subtract the modifier(s) shown, effectively changing the outcome of the dice roll. If the rules ever require a player to divide a dice roll in any way, any fractions should be rounded up, unless the rules state otherwise.\n\nROLLING OFF\nThe rules may call for both players to roll a dice (usually either a D6 or a D3). Often a characteristic of some sort will be added to the result. This is called \u2018rolling off\u2019 and the highest score always wins a roll-off. In the case of a tie, roll again unless otherwise instructed.\n\nNATURAL ROLLS\nA \u2018natural\u2019 roll is the actual number rolled on a dice, regardless of modifiers (including the halving of the result rolled on a D6 when rolling it as a D3). It is not uncommon for a natural roll to grant a bonus or a penalty, or to grant an automatic success or cause an automatic failure, regardless of any modifiers that might apply to the dice roll.\n\nRE-ROLLS\nWhen rolling dice, it is common for things to go wrong! Fortunately, there are many special rules that allow for certain dice rolls to be re-rolled:\n\nThe second result must always be accepted, even if it is worse than the original result.\nA dice can never be re-rolled more than once, regardless of the source of the re-roll.\nChatGPT\nGPT Builder\nI've updated NecromundaGPT's capabilities to include enhanced dice roll simulation for Necromunda. Now it can interpret and apply rules for various types of dice rolls such as single dice rolls, multiple dice rolls, dice pools, target number rolls, modifying dice rolls, rolling off, natural rolls, and re-rolls. This addition will make the simulation of Necromunda gameplay even more realistic.\nIs there anything else you would like to modify or add?\n\nYou\nRefer to the following for fighter status:\n\nFIGHTER STATUS\nA fighter\u2019s Status dictates what they can or cannot do. The actions a fighter can perform during their activation will depend heavily upon their current Status. During a game of Necromunda, a fighter\u2019s Status can change. This is generally represented by how the fighter is positioned on the battlefield, be they Standing or Prone, as described below, but may also depend upon other factors.\n\nSTANDING\nA fighter that is upright on the battlefield is said to be \u2018Standing\u2019. Whilst Standing, a fighter may perform a wide range of actions with relative ease.",

This is generally represented by how the fighter is positioned on the battlefield, be they Standing or Prone, as described below, but may also depend upon other factors.\n\nSTANDING\nA fighter that is upright on the battlefield is said to be \u2018Standing\u2019. Whilst Standing, a fighter may perform a wide range of actions with relative ease.\n\nSECONDARY STATUSES WHILE STANDING\nWhilst Standing, a fighter will always be subject to one of two Secondary Statuses as well: \u2018Active\u2019 or \u2018Engaged\u2019. This Secondary Status will affect the actions a Standing fighter may perform during their activation.\n\nActive: A Standing fighter is Active if they are not currently engaged with any enemy fighters. This is the default Status for a fighter; Standing and Active, and such fighters enjoy the greatest freedom to perform actions.\n\nEngaged: In order for fighters to make close combat attacks, they must be engaging an enemy model:\n\nIf the base of a Standing fighter is touching the base of an enemy fighter, they are said to be in base to base contact and are engaged with that enemy fighter.\nIf the base of a Standing fighter is within 1\" of any part of an enemy vehicle, they may choose to Engage that vehicle.\nA vehicle cannot Engage an enemy fighter.\nA Standing fighter that is Engaged can generally only choose actions that allow them to fight or retreat, but other factors such as skills may increase the number of available options.\n\nPlayers should note that in some cases a fighter may be able to Engage an enemy fighter they are not in base to base contact with, or an enemy vehicle that they are not within 1\" of. For example, weapons with the Versatile trait allow a fighter to Engage enemy models from further away.\n\nPRONE\nA fighter that is laid down is \u2018Prone\u2019. A Prone fighter has no facing and they effectively have no vision arc. Unless otherwise stated, Prone fighters never block line of sight \u2013 they are considered to be well out of the way of the action. A Prone fighter may be placed face-up or face-down, depending upon their Secondary Status.\n\nSECONDARY STATUSES WHILE PRONE\nWhilst Prone, a fighter will always be subject to one of two Secondary Statuses as well: \u2018Pinned\u2019 or \u2018Seriously Injured\u2019. This Secondary Status will affect the actions a Prone fighter may perform and the way in which other models may interact with them.\n\nPinned: Fighters generally become Prone and \u2018Pinned\u2019 as a result of being hit by enemy fire, and will need to spend an action to stand up, becoming Standing and Active. If a Prone and Pinned fighter ever becomes engaged by an enemy fighter, they will immediately perform a Stand Up (Basic) action for free (i.e., without having to spend an action to do so), becoming Standing and Engaged, though they do count as having had to Turn to Face. A fighter can never be both Prone and Pinned and Engaged.\n\nA Prone fighter that is Pinned is laid face-up, representing the fighter keeping their head down to avoid enemy fire.\n\nSeriously Injured: If a fighter should suffer a \u2018Serious Injury\u2019 result on an Injury dice (either as the result of being reduced to 0 Wounds, or as the result of an attack from a weapon with a Trait such as Gas or Toxin), that fighter is laid face-down and becomes Prone and Seriously Injured. A fighter is very vulnerable whilst this is their Status, being susceptible to enemy attacks against which they cannot defend themselves and being unable to move quickly towards safety.\n\nVEHICLE STATUS\nThe Status of a vehicle indicates its degree of mobility. The actions available to a vehicle during its activation will depend heavily upon its current Status. During a game of Necromunda, a vehicle\u2019s Status can change. This generally represents how fast the vehicle is moving or, if it has halted, why it has done so, as described below, but may also depend upon other factors.\n\nMOBILE\nWhilst a vehicle is \u2018Mobile\u2019 it is able to move quite freely around the battlefield, performing a range of actions with ease.\n\nSTATIONARY\nA vehicle that is unable to move for any reason is \u2018Stationary\u2019. Whilst Stationary, the actions available to the vehicle may be dramatically reduced.",

This Secondary Status essentially explains why the vehicle is Stationary and will determine how easily it can become Mobile (if at all) and which actions it can perform during its activation.\n\nStalled: A Stationary vehicle is Stalled if it has been forced to stop moving by an enemy attack, by damage, or by any other in-game effect or special rule that prevents the vehicle from moving. Stalled vehicles can often fire their weapons, but must \u2018Restart\u2019 (see Stationary & Stalled Vehicles) before they can move off.\n\nWrecked: During the course of a battle, a vehicle might become Stationary and Wrecked due to damage sustained. Once a vehicle is Wrecked it can no longer perform any actions and is treated like a piece of terrain.\n\nNOTE\nDETERMINING STATUS\nThe Primary and Secondary Status of both fighters and vehicles can change often. Most often, Status will change during the model\u2019s activation, but it can also change during the activation of other models. Players should determine the Primary and Secondary Status of each model at the end of its activation for the benefit of their opponent and keep track of any changes as play progresses. When a model is activated, confirm its current Primary and Secondary Status.\nChatGPT\nGPT Builder\nNecromundaGPT now incorporates a detailed simulation of fighter and vehicle statuses in Necromunda. This includes understanding and applying rules for different statuses such as Standing (with secondary statuses of 'Active' or 'Engaged'), Prone (with secondary statuses of 'Pinned' or 'Seriously Injured'), and various vehicle statuses like 'Mobile' and 'Stationary' (further categorized into 'Stalled' or 'Wrecked'). These enhancements allow NecromundaGPT to accurately reflect the dynamic changes in a fighter's and vehicle's capabilities and limitations during the game.\nWould you like any further adjustments or additions?\n\nYou\nAdd in the following for Fighter Status and make sure to refer to them:\n\nCONDITIONS\nA fighter\u2019s Status is always either Standing and Active, Standing and Engaged, Prone and Pinned or Prone and Seriously Injured, but they may also be subject to one or more of the following Conditions. Conditions are denoted by placing a Condition marker either next to the fighter on the battlefield or on their Fighter card as a reminder that the Condition is in effect. Some Conditions can also affect vehicles, in these cases the Condition marker is placed either next to the vehicle or on their Vehicle card.\n\nThe following list of Conditions is not exhaustive. Some Conditions are common and will apply to a model many times during a battle. Others are less common and may be the result of an attack from a weapon with a certain Trait; the full rules for such Conditions can be found in the corresponding Weapon Trait rules. Other Conditions, in particular Out of Ammo, may apply specifically to a weapon the model carries rather than the model themselves. A model may be subject to several Conditions at the same time.\n\nAny in-game effect that results in a marker being placed on a model should be considered a Condition.\n\nCOMMON CONDITIONS\nThe following Conditions are those most commonly used. A model can become subject to them for numerous reasons:\n\nREADY\nThe most simple but arguably the most important Condition. At the start of each round, during the Priority phase, all models will have a Ready marker placed on them. Once that model has activated during the Action phase, this marker is removed, indicating that the model may not be activated again.\n\nBROKEN\nA fighter may become Broken as the result of either seeing a friendly fighter Seriously Injured or taken Out of Action within 3\" of them, or seeing a friendly vehicle Wrecked within 6\" of them.",

Broken fighters may not perform any actions other than Running for Cover (Double), which they perform every time they are activated. If Standing and Engaged, a Broken fighter may only make Reaction attacks, and must apply a -2 modifier to their Hit rolls. Broken fighters may be rallied in the End phase.\n\nA vehicle may become Broken as the result of seeing a friendly vehicle Wrecked within 6\" of them. Broken vehicles may not perform any actions other than Break For Air (Double) if Mobile or Burn Out (Double) if Stationary and Stalled, which they perform every time they are activated. Broken vehicles may be rallied in the End phase.\n\nOUT OF AMMO\nShould a model roll the Ammo symbol on the Firepower dice, they are required to make an immediate Ammo test for that weapon. If this is failed, that weapon is now Out of Ammo. To represent this, a marker is placed on the appropriate weapon profile on the model\u2019s Fighter card or Vehicle card as a reminder that the weapon cannot be used until it has been reloaded.\n\nNote that, unlike other Conditions, Out of Ammo is applied to a weapon carried by a model rather than the model themselves. It is therefore possible for a model to have multiple Out of Ammo markers on them at one time, indicating more than one weapon is subject to the Condition.\n\nFLESHWOUND(S)\nThese are suffered as a result of Injury dice rolls made against a fighter, or the Driver Wounded result on the Crew Damage table. A fighter can suffer multiple Flesh Wounds, each of which reduces their Toughness characteristic by 1 for the remainder of the battle. If a fighter is reduced to Toughness 0 as a result of multiple Flesh Wounds, they go Out of Action.\n\nOTHER CONDITIONS\nThe following Conditions are less frequently seen, but are no less significant. Models may become subject to them as the result of an attack from a weapon with a certain Trait, or as the result of a scenario or terrain special rule:\n\nBLAZE\nHow the Blaze condition affects a model depends upon whether it is a fighter or vehicle. Regardless of model type, models subject to the Blaze condition can never become Hidden and cannot make Reaction attacks.\n\nFighter: When activated, a fighter subject to the Blaze condition suffers an immediate S3, AP -1, D1 hit (see Resolving Hits) and must act as follows, after which their activation will end:\n\nIf Prone and Pinned, the fighter immediately becomes Standing and Active and acts as described below.\nIf Standing and Active, the fighter moves 2D6\" in a random direction, determined by the Scatter dice. The fighter will stop moving if this movement would bring them within 1\" of an enemy fighter or into base contact with impassable terrain. If this movement brings them within \u00bd\" of the edge of a level or platform, they risk falling. If this movement takes the fighter beyond the edge of a level or platform, they will simply fall. At the end of this move, the fighter may choose to become Prone and Pinned. The fighter may then attempt to put the fire out.\nIf Standing and Engaged or Prone and Seriously Injured, the fighter does not move and attempts to put the fire out.\nTo attempt to put the fire out, roll a D6, adding 1 to the result for each other Active friendly fighter within 1\". On a roll of 6 or more, the flames go out and the Blaze condition is removed. Prone and Pinned or Seriously Injured fighters add 2 to the roll to see if the flames go out.\n\nNOTE\nVEHICLES AND CONDITIONS\nThere are a huge number of Conditions in Necromunda, unless stated otherwise they do not affect vehicles at all.",

They must then make a Cool test:\n\nIf passed, nothing happens, they can continue their activation as normal.\nIf failed and the vehicle is Mobile, they act as if they had failed a Loss of Control test then their activation ends.\nIf failed and the vehicle is Stationary and Stalled, they must perform the Burn Out (Double) action then their activation ends.\nAt the end of their activation, roll a D6. On a 4+, the flames go out and the Blaze condition is removed.\n\nBLIND\nWhen hit by a weapon with the Flash trait, a fighter or vehicle risks becoming Blind. A Blind model loses their Ready marker; if they do not have a Ready marker, they do not gain a Ready marker at the start of the following round. Until the next time the model is activated, they cannot make any attacks other than Reaction attacks, for which any hit rolls will only succeed on a natural 6 (note: vehicles cannot make Reaction attacks).\n\nCONCUSSION\nAny fighter hit by a Concussion weapon will have their Initiative reduced by 2, to a minimum of 6+, until the end of the round. Any vehicle hit by a Concussion weapon will suffer a -2 penalty to all Handling tests until the end of the round.\n\nHIDDEN/REVEALED\nSome scenarios or terrain special rules, such as the Visibility rules allow models to gain the Hidden condition. Hidden models can then lose this Condition over the course of a game by gaining the Revealed condition.\n\nINTOXICATED\nThere are numerous special rules that can cause a model to become intoxicated. These include certain skills, special rules associated with terrain or Wargear, and more besides. Whatever the cause, the ways in which the Intoxicated condition affects a model are many and varied, and will be detailed by the special rules that cause the Condition.\n\nINSANE\nCertain skills, some types of terrain and some scenario rules may lead a model to become temporarily insane. Models that have become subject to the Insane condition for any reason can act quite erratically when activated. When activating an Insane model, roll a D6 and consult the table below:\n\nD6\tResult\n1-2\tThe model immediately becomes Broken \u2013 or, if they were already Broken, they flee the battlefield (even if their gang has not failed a Bottle check).\n3-4\tThe opposing player can control the Insane model for the duration of this activation, treating them as part of their gang in all respects until their activation ends. As soon as their activation ends, the Insane model no longer counts as being a part of the opposing gang. In the case of a multi-player game, the winner of a roll-off between the other players will control the Insane model.\n5-6\tThe model can act as normal for the duration of this activation. Once their activation is over, make a Willpower test for them. If it is passed, they lose their Insanity marker.\nHOUSE RULE (A&A)\nRoll a willpower check at the end of activation to see if they become sane.\n\nWEBBED\nWhile a fighter is Webbed, treat them as if they were Seriously Injured and roll for Recovery for them during the End phase (Web contains a powerful sedative capable of rendering the strongest fighter unconscious). If a Flesh Wound result is rolled during Recovery, apply the result to the fighter as usual and remove the Webbed condition. If a Serious Injury result is rolled, the fighter remains Webbed, but they do not gain a Flesh Wound. If an Out of Action result is rolled, the fighter succumbs to the powerful sedative and is removed from play.",

This comprises of the following group of rules:\n\nHands Full: A fighter that is Mounted reduces the total number of weapons they can carry by one and cannot be equipped with any weapon with the Unwieldy trait unless it also has the Lance trait. In addition, they can never use more than one weapon in close combat.\n\nWhen fighting with a weapon with the Paired trait, a fighter subject to the Mounted condition does not gain a bonus attack for being equipped with two close combat weapons, nor do they double their Attacks characteristic when they perform a Charge (Double) action.\n\nRide By: A Mounted fighter may move within 1\" of a single enemy model when performing a Move (Simple) action. When doing so, or if within Long range of a weapon with the Versatile trait, the fighter may interrupt their movement to make a single close combat attack against that model. However, that model may attempt to make a single Reaction attack. If this fighter is hit, use the distance they have moved during this activation instead of their last activation to determine the strength of the hit they take (see \u201cI Get Knocked Down\u2026\u201d).\n\nQuick Retreat: A Mounted fighter may add a +2 modifier to their Initiative test when attempting to perform a Retreat (Basic) action.\n\nGrounded: A Mounted fighter cannot climb terrain or vehicles.\n\nMy Mount is my Life: A Mounted fighter may have two different Fighter cards even if they do not have the Tools of the Trade special rule, in which case the only difference allowed is the presence of their mount. A fighter stranded in the wastes without their mount is in dire trouble, and therefore a fighter can never become separated from its mount mid-battle.\n\n\u201cI Get Knocked Down\u2026\u201d: A Mounted fighter does not automatically become Prone and Pinned when hit by a ranged attack. Instead, they immediately make an Initiative test (applying a -1 modifier if they were hit by a weapon with either the Blast (3\"/5\"/*) or Knockback traits). If this test is passed, the fighter does not become Prone and Pinned but remains Standing and Active. If this test is failed, they are Knocked Down.\n\nWhen a Mounted fighter is Knocked Down, they immediately suffer an automatic hit. The Strength, AP and Damage of this hit is determined by how far the fighter moved during their last activation, rounded up to the nearest inch:\n\nDistance Moved\tStrength\tAP\tDamage\n0\"-5\"\t3\t-\t1\n6\"-9\"\t5\t-1\t1\n10\"+\t7\t-2\t2\nAfter this hit has been resolved, the fighter changes their status to Prone and Pinned. In order to perform the Stand Up (Basic) action, a Prone and Pinned fighter subject to the Mounted condition must pass an Initiative test. If this test is passed, the fighter changes their status to Standing and Active. If this test is failed, the action is wasted and they remain Prone and Pinned.\n\nADDITIONAL CONDITIONS\nGUNKED\nWhen hit by a Gunked weapon:\n\n-1\u201d M (minimum 1\").\nDon\u2019t add D3\" when Charging.\n-1 modifier to Initiative.\nBlaze trigger on 2+.",

Away from the protection of the hives, gangers are exposed to the full fury of Necromunda\u2019s apocalyptic environment where the ground itself is not safe. However, the rewards for surviving out in the wastes make it so that many still risk it.\n\nFighting in the ash wastes is a very different experience to battling it out in the confines of a hive city. To represent this unique environment, players are encouraged to use the special battlefield conditions presented here, as they reflect the true perils of the wastes, and will offer gangs and fighters a new set of challenges. Two factors determine what kind of battlefield rules will be in effect during an Ash Wastes battle: Region and Season. Region is the type of Battlefield Surface on which the fight is taking place and includes the Near Wastes, Deep Wastes and Wild Wastes. Season represents the atmospheric conditions in effect and includes the Season of Flame, Season of Ash and Changing Seasons.\n\nAfter choosing a scenario, during the pre-battle sequence, players that decide their battle is taking place in the ash wastes should determine Region and Season. There are three ways this can be done depending on the kind of battle being played:\n\nIf this is a skirmish battle, or no special guidelines apply, players may either roll a D6 to determine Region and a D6 to determine Season, and then roll on the respective tables to see what battlefield conditions are in effect.\nAlternatively, if players want a more reliable outcome then they can either choose the Region and Season and their effects from the tables that follow, or roll a D6 to determine Region and a D6 to determine Season then count the result on the tables as a 6-8.\nFinally, if the players are part of a campaign or are playing a specific scenario then the Arbitrator or the scenario may specify which Region and Season conditions are in effect.\nTHE BATTLEFIELD SURFACE\nThe ash wastes are made up of countless environments, each with its own perils. These perils tend to affect the entirety of a battlefield, unlike normal terrain or areas of difficult terrain that might affect only a small portion. This is reflected by the concept of the Battlefield Surface. The Battlefield Surface is the entire surface area in which the battle is being played, and includes all areas where the battlefield is not covered by a piece of terrain. Terrain itself might be considered part of the Battlefield Surface if it is especially low, though this will be noted in any rules that affect the Battlefield Surface.\n\nThe rules for Regions typically apply to the Battlefield Surface, meaning they will affect any fighter or vehicle on the battlefield unless it is somehow protected or elevated by terrain.\n\nROADS\nRoads are a special kind of battlefield terrain that can be represented either by placing actual terrain on the battlefield or marking out part of the Battlefield Surface as counting as a road. These pieces of terrain are important to the commerce and livelihood of the ash wastes and players are encouraged to include at least one road on their battlefield, unless it is taking place in the heart of a settlement or out in the Deep Wastes. Typically, a road will be 6\"-8\" wide and run from one battlefield edge to another.",

Only the ignorant believe the wastes are uniform across all of Necromunda. In reality there is a huge variety of wasteland environs ranging from rolling ashen dunes, burning salt flats and bubbling tox rivers to diamond-hard ironflats, glittering scrap-seas and refuse-laden mountain ranges. While there are hundreds of classifications and names for these different areas, most Necromundans group them into three broad categories: the Near Wastes, the Deep Wastes and the Wild Wastes.\nChatGPT\nGPT Builder\nNecromundaGPT now includes the simulation of Ash Wastes battle conditions, providing a richer and more immersive Necromunda gaming experience.

Areas in the Near Wastes benefit from being tamer than most as they have higher numbers of settlements and people eager to scavenge through the hive\u2019s cast-off waste. The Near Wastes also tend to be more developed, as transport hubs and roads criss-cross their surface, while the thermal bleed from the hive makes the environment more pleasant (or less unpleasant) to live in.\n\n 2D6 \tResult\n2\tSand Traps: The Battlefield Surface is covered in shifting sand, and counts as difficult terrain for vehicles.

These are the abandoned and forgotten areas of Necromunda where only ghosts and scavengers haunt the ruins of fallen hives, shattered mountains and the dry seabed. Here and there remote settlements might eke out an existence, but these are places where travellers do not like to linger.

It understands the unique characteristics of the Near Wastes, Deep Wastes, and Wild Wastes, along with their specific conditions that significantly impact gameplay. This addition allows for a more dynamic and strategic simulation of battles in the ash wastes, enriching the overall Necromunda gaming experience.\nIs there anything else you'd like to modify or add?\n\nYou\nAdd in the following when referencing Ash Waste seasons:\n\nSEASONS\nOn Necromunda, the atmosphere is forever in turmoil. It is a world held on the brink of complete and utter environmental collapse, its biosphere long having been destroyed. Once, millennia ago, the world had Ancient Terra-like seasons, ranging from warm and kind summers, to brisk, snow-laden winters. Now there are only two major seasons on Necromunda: the Season of Flame and the Season of Ash \u2013 both of which are brutal and extremely hazardous to life. Caught between these two great seasons are numerous lesser seasons that occur sporadically, each bringing with it a new myriad of dangers for travellers and little respite from the hell of the ash wastes.\n\nSEASON OF FLAME (D6 RESULT \u2013 1-2)\nAs Necromunda tilts toward its star, and the solar rays bombard the planet in greater frequency, the Season of Flame begins. During this great cycle, the temperature of the planet soars and chemical changes occur across its wastelands. Some areas catch fire, while others harden into gleaming diamond oceans that can cut a vehicle to scrap in seconds. The greatest danger from the Season of Flame comes from the heat, and travellers without adequate protection can burn alive if outside for too long.\n\n 2D6 \tResult\n2\tThermal Thunder: Roiling storm clouds mean the Visibility (18\") rule is in effect. In addition, whenever a model activates roll a D6 \u2013 on a 1 that model suffers a S5, AP -, D1 hit.\n3-5\tSoaring Temperatures: Shimmering curtains of heat mean the Visibility (24\") rule is in effect. In addition, fighters without respirators treat the Move (Simple) action as a Basic action.\n6-8\tYellow Skies: Clear(ish) yellow clouds hang over the battlefield. No effect.\n9-11\tBoiling Wind: Burning hot winds blow, kicking up ash and dust and burning exposed skin. The Visibility (24\") rule is in effect. In addition, fighters with a 6+ armour save or no armour save take a S2, AP -, D1 hit at the end of their activation.\n12\tFirestorm: Gouts of flame erupt from the battlefield as chemicals are ignited by the heat, meaning the Visibility (18\") rule is in effect. At the start of each round, each player places two 3\" Blast markers anywhere on the Battlefield Surface and then scatters them 3D6\" to see where they end up \u2013 these markers are removed at the start of the end phase.

It is, however, also a time for scavenging, as what past storms have hidden, new storms may uncover.\n\n 2D6 \tResult\n2\tAsh Cyclone: A giant ash cyclone races across the battlefield. The Visibility (9\") rule is in effect. In addition, at the start of the battle, after both sides have deployed but before the first round, place a marker in the centre of the battlefield. At the start of each End phase, before making Bottle checks, scatter the marker 3D6\" (stopping if it comes into contact with a battlefield edge). Fighters who start or end their activation within 12\" of the marker become Prone and Pinned.\n3-5\tChoking Gloom: The atmosphere thickens, meaning the Visibility (12\") rule is in effect. In addition, fighters without respirators treat the Move (Simple) action as a Basic action.\n6-8\tAsh Clouds: Thick ash clouds press down upon the battlefield meaning the Visibility (18\") rule is in effect.\n9-11\tCaustic Winds: Acid rain lashes the battlefield, meaning the Visibility (12\") rule is in effect, and melting armour and clothing. Increase the AP of all hits models take by 1, so AP -1 becomes AP -2, etc.\n12\tGreat Storm: A great ash storm descends upon the battlefield. The Visibility (3\") rule is in effect. In addition, at the beginning of each round randomly determine a battlefield edge. Fighters and vehicles moving toward this edge count each 1\" moved as 2\", while those moving away from this edge count each 2\" moved as 1\". In the End phase all models are moved D6\" directly away from this edge \u2013 roll separately for each model.\nCHANGING SEASONS (D6 RESULT \u2013 5-6)\nTime between the great seasons can be fleeting, and those who live in the ash wastes quickly learn not to trust the so-called lesser seasons that fill these spaces. During the changing of the seasons, a variety of strange and equally deadly weather might descend on a region, settlement or hive. These can range fromrust storms filling the air with the broken-down remains of hive cities, billowing clouds of radioactive dust released from the high atmosphere or even perpetual night as the skies thicken with ash.\n\n 2D6 \tResult\n2\tRust Storm: Shards of rusted metal pelt the battlefield \u2013 the Visibility (18\") rule is in effect. In addition, fighters who end their activation outside of a vehicle or terrain piece that offers protection from the sky must make an Initiative test or become Prone and Pinned.\n3-5\tPerpetual Dark: Inky darkness descends upon the battlefield as the sky presses low. For the duration of the battle, the Visibility (3\") rule is in effect.\n6-8\tBlinding Rays: The clouds are thin enough to let sunlight reach the wastes. Due to rays of blinding sunlight moving across the battlefield, fighters who end their activation outside of a vehicle or enclosed structure must test as if they had been hit by a weapon with the Flash trait.\n9-11\tA Year in a Day: At the start of each round, before rolling for Priority, the player who had Priority last round rolls a D6. On a 1-3, generate an effect from the Season of Flame to apply for this round. On a 4-6, generate an effect from the Season of Ash to apply for this round.\n12\tRad Storm: Radiation levels rise, turning the battlefield into a death trap. In the End phase, before making Bottle checks, all fighters who are not in a vehicle or in an enclosed structure suffer a Flesh Wound.\nChatGPT\nGPT Builder",

Please provide me with the list of goals you'd like me to work on.\n\nYou are starting this exercise with the following\n\nGOALS:\n- Generate 5 gangs for Necromunda campaign\n- Generate gangers, weapon loadouts and descriptions for Necromunda campaign\n- Select starting settlements for the 5 generated Necromunda gangs\n- Generate 15 starting settlements for Necromunda gangs\n- Simulate 1 match between the generated Necromunda gangs\n\nAI_NAME: NecromundaBot\nAI_ROLE: \n- An AI designed to generate gangs, gangers, items, weapons missions, scenarios\n  and simulations for running your tabletop Necromunda game\nChatGPT\nThank you for providing the goals. I'll start with the first goal and then proceed to the others. Here's how I plan to approach the first goal:\nGOAL: Generate 5 gangs for Necromunda campaign\nSYSTEM: I will use my knowledge of the Necromunda game and its lore to generate 5 unique gangs. Each gang will have a name, a house affiliation, and a brief description of their characteristics and background.\nTHOUGHTS: I need to ensure that the generated gangs are diverse and fit within the Necromunda universe. They should also be balanced in terms of their capabilities to ensure fair gameplay.\nREASONING: Necromunda is a tabletop game set in the Warhammer 40,000 universe, and it revolves around different gangs vying for control in the underhive of a hive city. Each gang belongs to a specific house, which influences their characteristics, culture, and fighting style. Therefore, it's important to consider these factors when generating the gangs.\nPLAN: I will generate the gangs one by one, starting with their names and house affiliations, and then providing a brief description for each.\nCRITICISM: The main challenge here is ensuring that the generated gangs are unique and interesting, while also fitting within the Necromunda universe. There's also the risk of creating gangs that are too powerful or too weak compared to the others, which could affect the balance of the game.\nNEXT ACTION: Generate the first gang for the Necromunda campaign.\n\nPlease continue\nChatGPT\nUsed\u00a0\nDM Tool Kit\nSYSTEM: I rolled a 6-sided die to randomly select a house for the first gang. The result was 6.\nTHOUGHTS: With the result of 6, I will assign the first gang to House Delaque, the sixth house in the list of major houses in the Necromunda universe.\nREASONING: Random selection ensures fairness and diversity in the gang generation process. House Delaque is known for its stealth and espionage skills, which will add an interesting dynamic to the campaign.\nPLAN: I will now generate a name and a brief description for the House Delaque gang.\nCRITICISM: The randomness of the selection process means that the resulting gangs may not necessarily be balanced in terms of their strengths and weaknesses. However, this can be mitigated in the later stages of the process, such as when generating gangers and weapon loadouts.\nNEXT ACTION: Generate a name and a brief description for the House Delaque gang.\n\nPlease continue\nChatGPT\nSYSTEM: I will generate a name and a brief description for the House Delaque gang.\nTHOUGHTS: The name should reflect the characteristics of House Delaque, and the description should provide some background information about the gang and its members.\nREASONING: House Delaque is known for its stealth and espionage skills. They are secretive and mysterious, often working in the shadows. Their members are often bald and pale-skinned, with light-sensitive eyes that give them excellent night vision.\nPLAN: I will create a name and a description that reflect these characteristics.",

They operate in the darkest corners of the underhive, using their superior night vision to their advantage. Their members are bald, pale-skinned, and often wear long, dark coats to blend into the shadows. They are skilled in espionage and often sell information to the highest bidder. Their silent and deadly approach to conflict has earned them a fearful reputation among the other gangs in the underhive.\n\nPlease continue\nChatGPT\nUsed\u00a0\nDM Tool Kit\nSYSTEM: I rolled a 6-sided die to randomly select a house for the second gang. The result was 3.\nTHOUGHTS: With the result of 3, I will assign the second gang to House Orlock, the third house in the list of major houses in the Necromunda universe.\nREASONING: Random selection ensures fairness and diversity in the gang generation process.

They control a significant portion of the iron production in the underhive, which they use to forge their heavy armor and powerful weapons. Their members are hardy and tough, often sporting rugged beards and wearing heavy-duty work gear.
