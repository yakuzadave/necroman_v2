{"query": "How does the \"Limited\" weapon trait affect the availability of special ammo types in Necromunda? Provide an example of how this trait can impact gameplay.", "response": "The \"Limited\" weapon trait in Necromunda affects the availability of special ammo types. When a weapon with the Limited trait is used and fails an Ammo test, the special ammo type is depleted and deleted from the Fighter or Vehicle card until it is repurchased. This means that the weapon can no longer use that specific special ammo type until it is reacquired. However, the weapon can still be reloaded normally with any remaining profiles it may have. It is important to note that only one 'dose' of ammo can be carried per weapon. \n\nFor example, let's say a player is using a weapon with the Limited trait that has a special ammo type called \"Explosive Rounds.\" During a battle, the player attempts to use the Explosive Rounds but fails the Ammo test. As a result, the Explosive Rounds are depleted and removed from the Fighter or Vehicle card. The player will need to repurchase the Explosive Rounds in order to use them again with that weapon. However, the weapon can still be reloaded with any other remaining profiles it may have, such as regular ammunition. This limitation adds a strategic element to gameplay, as players need to carefully manage their special ammo resources and consider when to use them."}
