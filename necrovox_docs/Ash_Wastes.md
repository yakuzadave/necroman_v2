In the harsh environment of Necromunda's wilderness, gangs vie for control of vital trade routes that connect hive cities. The Ash Wastes Campaign is a comprehensive narrative campaign that incorporates existing Necromunda rules with special additions to recreate the challenges of battling in this unforgiving terrain.

Your goal: claim stretches of the wastes, connecting settlements, hives, or landmarks to establish dominance and reap the benefits of trade. But don't expect it to be easy - you'll face off against rival gangs, harsh elements, changing seasons, and even factions like the Ash Wastes Nomads who seek to destroy hive city dominance.

2. Survive and overcome challenges from:
	* Harsh weather and terrain
	* Rival gangs seeking dominance
	* Factions like the Ash Wastes Nomads disrupting trade
