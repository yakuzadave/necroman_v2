He's eager to prove himself in battle and make a name for himself within the Escher Gang.\n\n\n# Gang Goals\nAs Aurélien \"The Architect\" Escher, your primary goal is to infiltrate the hab-block and gather intel on the Goffs' operations within the underhive. You've received a tip that they're planning to smuggle a valuable shipment of rare minerals out of the hive, and you aim to intercept them before they can get away.\n\nSecondary goals:\n\n1. **Sabotage**: Disrupt the Goffs' operations by stealing or destroying key equipment, compromising their ability to operate effectively in the underhive.\n2. **Recruitment**: Identify potential recruits who share your gang's values and ideology, and bring them into your fold.\n3. **Expansion**: Expand your gang's influence by establishing new alliances, acquiring valuable resources, and securing strategic locations within the underhive.\n\nNow that you've got a solid plan in place, let's get back to executing it!\n\nYou're currently hiding in the ventilation shaft with Elara, waiting for the perfect moment to strike. You can hear the Goffs and Delaques engaging in a fierce battle outside, creating chaos and distractions.\n\nWhat do you want to do next?\n\n(Remember, as the Game Master, I'll help guide the game and provide the necessary rules and mechanics guidance. Just let me know what you need!)\n\n# Gang Stronghold\nLet's add some context to your gang's operations.\n\n**Gang Stronghold:** \"The Maze of Reflections\"\n\nLocated deep within the underhive, The Maze of Reflections is a labyrinthine complex that serves as the Escher Gang's stronghold. This maze-like structure is a testament to the gang's ingenuity and resourcefulness, with twisting corridors, hidden chambers, and secret passages.\n\nThe stronghold is a hub for the gang's operations, where they plan and execute their heists, store their loot, and conduct their illicit activities. The Maze of Reflections is also home to the gang's leader, Aurélien \"The Architect\" Escher, who oversees all aspects of the gang's operations from his command center.\n\n**Gang Description:**\n\nThe Escher Gang is a secretive and cunning organization that operates in the shadows of the underhive. They are masters of manipulation, deception, and strategy, using their unique blend of skills to outmaneuver their rivals and adversaries.\n\nAs a gang, they are known for their expertise in infiltration, sabotage, and covert operations. Their motto, \"The Maze is our domain,\" reflects their ability to navigate the complex underhive environment with ease.\n\nTheir stronghold, The Maze of Reflections, serves as a symbol of their connection to the mysterious and ancient underhive. It's said that only those who are pure of heart and clever of mind can truly navigate the maze and uncover its secrets.\n\n**Gang Roster:**\n\n1. Aurélien \"The Architect\" Escher (Leader)\n2. Elara \"The Maze Runner\" (Expert Infiltrator)\n3. Kaelin \"The Shadow Dancer\" (Master of Stealth)\n4.

Under one name or another, they can trace their lineage back to the age of Martek Helm’ayr, the first Lord Helmawr, and, it is rumoured, even beyond that. Few now know of the early centuries of House Escher, the past of the clan hidden behind ritual and history. Rather, they are seen as what they have become: a matriarchy built upon a throne of chems and violence. These are the pillars of what it means to be Escher, a drive to prove their strength through skill at arms and reckless aggression, fuelled by a chemical empire that mixes Imperial science with pagan ritual. To outsiders, Eschers are cruel and deadly warriors, a perfection of the female fighter on Necromunda. Their gangs stalk the underhive alongside strange and exotic beasts, the mere touch of their weapons enough to corrupt blood or set a victim’s nerves on fire. Above these youthful and energetic gang warriors toils a House more prosperous than any on Necromunda – all women born beneath the beneficent smile of a Clan Chymist equal in the eyes of the Matriarch Primus and her Council of Crones. Thus may an Escher prove herself no matter the manner or place of her birthand, should she do well in the concoction of chems, therearing of xenos beasts, or fighting for the clan in the endless inter-House wars, she may well rise up to join the council herself – or perhaps even don the mantle of Matriarch Primus._\n\n## Gang Composition\n\nHouse Escher follows the [normal rules](/docs/founding-a-gang/gang-creation#gang-composition) for Gang Composition.\n\n## Special Rules\n\nFollow normal rules as other gangs with the following exceptions:\n\n- [Chem-alchemy Elixir](/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-escher/chem-alchemy): A gang visiting the Trading post during the post-battle sequence can buy any number of doses (Common).\n- Fighters promoted to Champion can only become a Matriarch, not a Death-Maiden.\n- Death-Maidens do not have Group Activation (1).\n\n## Fighters\n\n<FighterCard cost=\"125\">\n\n### Gang Queen (Leader)\n\n|  M  | WS  | BS  |  S  |  T  |  W  |  I  |  A  | Ld  | Cl  | Wil | Int |\n| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |\n| 5”  | 3+  | 3+  |  3  |  3  |  2  | 2+  |  3  | 5+  | 5+  | 6+  | 7+  |\n\n**Skills:** 1 Primary (custom).  \n**Restrictions:** None.  \n**Special Rules:** Gang Leader, Gang Hierarchy (Leader), Tools of the Trade, Group Activation (2).\n\n_It takes a lot of ruthlessness and no small talent for violence to be a Gang Queen. Those who rise to lead one of House Escher’s underhive gangs are, without exception, skilled killers and charismatic leaders, able to inspire their girls not with empty words and promises, but bloody deeds and sheer audacity. Of course the life of a Gang Queen is seldom a long one. As any Escher will tell you: the cost of living life on the edge is that eventually you fall over it._\n\n</FighterCard>\n\n<FighterCard cost=\"100\">\n\n### Gang Matriarch (Champion)\n\n|  M  | WS  | BS  |  S  |  T  |  W  |  I  |  A  | Ld  | Cl  | Wil | Int |\n| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |\n| 5”  | 3+  | 3+  |  3  |  3  |  2  | 2+  |  2  | 6+  | 6+  | 6+  | 6+  |\n\n**Skills:** 1 Primary (custom).  \n**Restrictions:** None.  \n**Special Rules:** Gang Hierarchy (Champion), Tools of the Trade, Group Activation (1).\n\n_Gang Matriarchs are drawn from the craziest, wildest and most homicidal of the Gang Queen’s girls, each one a natural killer. Favouring even more outlandish dress than most Escher, and carrying the deadliest weapons they can lay their hands on, a Matriarch is both gang enforcer, underhive assassin and debutant of death all rolled into one. It is no surprise then, that should the Gang Queen fall, it is one of the Matriarchs who will inevitably take her place as mistress of the gang._\n\n</FighterCard>\n\n<FighterCard cost=\"115\">\n\n### Death-Maiden (Specialist Champion)\n\n|  M  | WS  | BS  |  S  |  T  |  W  |  I  |  A  | Ld  | Cl  | Wil | Int |\n| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |\n| 6”  | 2+  | 3+  |  3  |  4  |  2  | 2+  |  3  | 8+  | 4+  | 7+  | 7+  |\n\n**Skills:** 1 Primary (custom).  \n**Restrictions:** Pistol and Close Combat.  \n**Special Rules:** Gang Hierarchy (Champion), Tools of the Trade, Poison Blood.\n\n#### Poison Blood\n\nToxin weapons can re-roll 1s before modifiers (against Toughness).\n\n_The Moraegan, or Deathmaidens, are the terror weapon of House Escher.

As they come of age, they become responsible women and take up their preordained role within the clan – or, at least, most do. Some become Wyld Runners; reckless and bold underhive explorers and beast wranglers, eventually joining the House gangs or forming their own crews of Wyld Runners and their venomous hunting Phelynx._\n\n</FighterCard>\n\n<FighterCard cost=\"20\">\n\n### Little Sister (Juve)\n\n|  M  | WS  | BS  |  S  |  T  |  W  |  I  |  A  | Ld  | Cl  | Wil | Int |\n| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |\n| 5”  | 4+  | 5+  |  3  |  3  |  1  | 3+  |  1  | 8+  | 8+  | 8+  | 8+  |\n\n**Restrictions:** Pistol, Basic, Close Combat.  \n**Special Rules:** Gang Fighter (Juve), Promotion (Escher Specialist), Fast Learner.\n\n_Little Sisters are gang newbies, who have given up the hab-factories or chem-domes of the House for the underhive.

It is well known that they make extensive use of strange and exotic creatures to fuel their pharmaceutical production, and the fact that it provides the raw materials for their outlandish costumes appears to be a fortuitous by-product. Most of these xenos life forms come the House’s way legally, through sanctioned trade with the Noble Houses of the upper spires and long-standing contracts and permits allow House Escher ready access to the segmentum’s most illustrious pedigree beast breeders._\n\n_More disturbingly, perhaps, is the fact that House Escher runs a dark and hidden trade in the creation of new life from the creatures they deal in. Gene-spliced hybrids, flesh-fused chimerae and other, darker fusions of different species are commonly created. Provided that House Escher continues to avoid the use of intelligent xenos life in their experimentation, the Imperial House continues to turn a blind eye, and so these dumb monstrosities are produced and sold to the gladiatoria to entertain the crowds, kept as attack beasts to guard and protect Escher holdings, and quite often make their way into the ranks of particularly well renown Escher gangs, where they add considerably to the status of Leaders and Champions._\n\n</FighterCard>\n\n<FighterCard cost=\"120\">\n\n### 0-2 Phyrr Cat (Exotic Beast)\n\n|  M  | WS  | BS  |  S  |  T  |  W  |  I  |  A  | Ld  | Cl  | Wil | Int |\n| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |\n| 7”  | 3+  |  -  |  3  |  3  |  1  | 2+  |  2  | 7+  | 8+  | 7+  | 8+  |\n\n**Wargear:** Sharp talons (same as: Mono-hook).\n\n#### Independent\n\nMust try to remain within 9” of the owner (instead of 3”).\n\n#### Lands on the Feet\n\n-2 Strength to any falling damage.\n\n_House Escher has a long tradition of dealing in many strange and exotic off-worldcreatures. At its most basic, this trade in xenos fauna helps to fuel many of theHouse’s unique elixirs and forms no small part of the basis for its trade and expertisein alchemical technology. A side effect of this prodigious, and often illicit, tradeinxenos lifeforms, is that House Escher has access to the pelts and plumage of manywonderful beasts, and this is clearly evidenced in the Escher style of dress. It is alsonot uncommon for House Escher to bring onto Necromunda the creatures that featurein the fighting pits and gladiatoria, a trade, which in turn, enables the House toset up ever more contacts amongst the many big game hunters and Rogue Traders that specialise in such commodities._\n\n_However, not all off-world beasts are destined for the Escher laboratoria or thefightingpits of Necromunda, some creatures are prized as companions, especially thevariousfelids that originate on many different worlds. Escher gangers are attracted to thebigcats of Phyrr in particular for their exotic looks and killer instincts. Such beasts arerare in the extreme and smuggling them planetside to Hive Primus is no meanfeat, sothey are an incredibly rare sight as pets even amongst the hierarchy of HouseEscher. Yet seen they are, and when the opportunity to acquire such a beast, or even better, amating pair, arises, Escher gang queens will go to any lengths to secure them._\n\n</FighterCard>\n\n<FighterCard cost=\"50\">\n\n### 0-3 Phelynx (Exotic Beast)\n\n|  M  | WS  | BS  |  S  |  T  |  W  |  I  |  A  | Ld  | Cl  | Wil | Int |\n| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |\n| 6”  | 4+  |  -  |  3  |  3  |  1  | 3+  |  2  | 10+ | 7+  | 9+  | 11+ |\n\n#### Venomous Bite\n\nIf hitting on a 6 (before modifiers), apply Toxin.\n\n#### Untamed\n\nAll attacks have Reckless (only has unarmed attack).\n\n_House Escher has created countless gene-smithed felinoid creatures. One of the most successful is the Phelynx, or Venom Cat. A mix of reptilian biology and Phyrr Cat genes, it is an excellent hunting beast. Phelynx are used almost exclusively by the Wyld, the Runners driving entire packs of the creatures before them into battle. As their name implies, a Venom Cat’s bite can be deadly, its neuro-toxic venom able to incapacitate or kill in moments. Wyld Runners routinely apply Phelynx venom to their weapons, while some even imbibe it in small doses to build up a resistance to the toxins. Venom Cats are also naturally stealthy beasts and, like the Wyld Runners themselves, are masters of ambush. Part of this stealth comes from the creature’s instinctive grace and speed, the rest from its unique biology. Unlike Phyrr Cats, Phelynx are coldblooded, their bio-signs barely registering at all, making them extremely difficultto spot with auspexes._\n\n_The bond between Phelynx and Wyld Runner is one built over a lifetime. When an Escher juve joins the Wyld, she will be given a weapon to master or a pet to train – this often coming in the form of an infant Phelynx. Over years of hunting and battle the Escher and beast become inseparable, one able to anticipate and coordinate with the actions of the other in a way no two human gangers could ever hope to match._\n\n</FighterCard>\n\n<FighterCard cost=\"50\">\n\n### Helion (Crew)\n\n| BS  | Ld  | Cl  | Wil | Int |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 4+  | 7+  | 7+  | 7+  | 7+  |\n\n</FighterCard>\n\n## Skill Access\n\n|                            | [Agility](/docs/gang-fighters-and-their-weaponry/skills/#agility) | [Combat](/docs/gang-fighters-and-their-weaponry/skills/#combat) | [Cunning](/docs/gang-fighters-and-their-weaponry/skills/#cunning) | [Driving](/docs/gang-fighters-and-their-weaponry/skills/#driving) | [Ferocity](/docs/gang-fighters-and-their-weaponry/skills/#ferocity) | [Leadership](/docs/gang-fighters-and-their-weaponry/skills/#leadership) | [Savant](/docs/gang-fighters-and-their-weaponry/skills/#savant) | [Shooting](/docs/gang-fighters-and-their-weaponry/skills/#shooting) | [Finesse](/docs/gang-fighters-and-their-weaponry/skills/gang-specific-skills#finesse) |\n| :------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Leader                     | Primary                                                           | Primary                                                         | Secondary                                                         | -

Over years of hunting and battle the Escher and beast become inseparable, one able to anticipate and coordinate with the actions of the other in a way no two human gangers could ever hope to match.\n\n**FighterCard**\n\n```markdown\n<FighterCard cost=\"50\">\n### Helion (Crew)\n\n| BS  | Ld  | Cl  | Wil | Int | \n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | \n| 4+   | 7+   | 7+   | 7+   | 7+   |\n\n</FighterCard>\n```\n\n**Skill Access**\n\n|                             | [Agility](/docs/gang-fighters-and-their-weaponry/skills/#agility) | [Combat](/docs/gang-fighters-and-their-weaponry/skills/#combat) | [Cunning](/docs/gang-fighters-and-their-weaponry/skills/#cunning) | [Driving](/docs/gang-fighters-and-their-weaponry/skills/#driving) | [Ferocity](/docs/gang-fighters-and-their-weaponry/skills/#ferocity) | [Leadership](/docs/gang-fighters-and-their-weaponry/skills/#leadership) | [Savant](/docs/gang-fighters-and-their-weaponry/skills/#savant) | [Shooting](/docs/gang-fighters-and-their-weaponry/skills/#shooting) | [Finesse](/docs/gang-fighters-and-their-weaponry/skills/gang-specific-skills#finesse) |\n| :------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Leader                      | Primary                                                            | Primary                                                          | Secondary                                                          | -

a gang known for their cunning, precision, and mastery of the labyrinthine underhive. Their fighters are the epitome of efficiency, using their knowledge of the hive's hidden passages to outmaneuver and outflank their opponents.\n\nAs we begin our campaign, I'll need you to generate your starting gang. Since House Escher is a popular choice among players, let's create a unique gang with its own distinct flavor.\n\n**Gang Name:** \"The Whispering Wraiths\"\n\n**Gang Leader:** Aurélien \"The Architect\" Escher - a master of the hive's hidden paths and a genius strategist.\n\n**Fighters:**\n\n1. **Name:** Elara \"The Maze Runner\" - a skilled navigator with expertise in navigating the underhive's treacherous tunnels.\n2. **Name:** Kaelin \"The Shadow Dancer\" - a stealthy assassin with unparalleled agility and the ability to blend into the shadows.\n3. **Name:** Cassius \"The Hive Whisperer\" - a charismatic leader with an uncanny connection to the hive's ancient energies, allowing him to sense hidden dangers and uncover hidden secrets.\n\n**Starting Equipment:**\n\n* 1x Medkit\n* 1x Combat Shotgun\n* 1x Power Fist\n* 1x Smoke Bomb\n\n**Starting Location:** The gang starts in the depths of Hive Primus, near the infamous \"Raven's Nest\" - a notorious black market hub where whispers and rumors spread like wildfire.\n\nNow that we have our starting gang, let's get into the action! You find yourself in the midst of a tense standoff between rival gangs. The air is thick with tension as both sides size each other up, waiting for the perfect moment to strike.\n\n**The Situation:** A group of Delaque agents has cornered a group of Goffs in an abandoned hab-block. The Delaques are demanding the Goffs hand over their prized \"Scavvy's Spoils\" - a stash of valuable scrap metal and machinery.\n\nWhat do you want to do?\n\n(Remember, when making decisions, please use the following format: `dice: 1d6` to roll for initiative or skill checks. If you need help with rules or mechanics, feel free to ask!) faction: \n\n#### <u>Assistant</u>:\nLet's get started.\n\nAs Aurélien \"The Architect\" Escher, I'll begin by assessing the situation and looking for opportunities to gain an advantage. I'll use my knowledge of the underhive's hidden passages to survey the area and identify potential escape routes or vantage points.\n\n**Perception Check:** dice: 1d6\n\nRolling... *rolls* Ah, it seems I've got a decent roll! With a result of 4, I manage to spot a narrow ventilation shaft on the wall nearby that might provide a covert entrance or exit point. It's not immediately visible, but with my expertise in navigating the underhive, I can see that it's a viable option.\n\nNow that I've identified this potential route, I'll use my cunning and strategic thinking to come up with a plan. Here are my thoughts:\n\n1. **Feint:** I'll create a diversion by using my Smoke Bomb to create a smokescreen near the main entrance of the hab-block. This will draw the attention of both the Delaque agents and the Goffs, making it harder for them to focus on each other.\n2. **Flanking Maneuver:** While the chaos ensues from the smoke bomb, I'll slip into the ventilation shaft with Elara \"The Maze Runner\" to get into position behind the Delaques. Our stealthy nature will allow us to remain undetected until we're ready to strike.\n3. **Ambush:** Once we're in position, Kaelin \"The Shadow Dancer\" and Cassius \"The Hive Whisperer\" will take care of the Goffs while I handle the Delaques. With my knowledge of the underhive's hidden passages, I'll be able to anticipate their movements and strike from unexpected angles.\n\nWhat do you think? Should we proceed with this plan, or is there another approach you'd like to explore?\n\n(Remember, as the Game Master, I'll help facilitate the gameplay and provide the necessary rules and mechanics guidance. Just let me know what you need!)\n#### Config\nmodel: necromunda-arbitrator\ntemperature: 0.5\n\n","x":760,"y":-1100,"width":540,"height":557,"color":"6"},

Under one name or another, they can trace their lineage back to the age of Martek Helm’ayr, the first Lord Helmawr, and, it is rumoured, even beyond that. Few now know of the early centuries of House Escher, the past of the clan hidden behind ritual and history. Rather, they are seen as what they have become: a matriarchy built upon a throne of chems and violence. These are the pillars of what it means to be Escher, a drive to prove their strength through skill at arms and reckless aggression, fuelled by a chemical empire that mixes Imperial science with pagan ritual. To outsiders, Eschers are cruel and deadly warriors, a perfection of the female fighter on Necromunda. Their gangs stalk the underhive alongside strange and exotic beasts, the mere touch of their weapons enough to corrupt blood or set a victim’s nerves on fire. Above these youthful and energetic gang warriors toils a House more prosperous than any on Necromunda – all women born beneath the beneficent smile of a Clan Chymist equal in the eyes of the Matriarch Primus and her Council of Crones. Thus may an Escher prove herself no matter the manner or place of her birthand, should she do well in the concoction of chems, therearing of xenos beasts, or fighting for the clan in the endless inter-House wars, she may well rise up to join the council herself – or perhaps even don the mantle of Matriarch Primus._\n\n## Gang Composition\n\nHouse Escher follows the [normal rules](/docs/founding-a-gang/gang-creation#gang-composition) for Gang Composition.\n\n## Special Rules\n\nFollow normal rules as other gangs with the following exceptions:\n\n- [Chem-alchemy Elixir](/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-escher/chem-alchemy): A gang visiting the Trading post during the post-battle sequence can buy any number of doses (Common).\n- Fighters promoted to Champion can only become a Matriarch, not a Death-Maiden.\n- Death-Maidens do not have Group Activation (1).\n\n## Fighters\n\n<FighterCard cost=\"125\">\n\n### Gang Queen (Leader)\n\n|  M  | WS  | BS  |  S  |  T  |  W  |  I  |  A  | Ld  | Cl  | Wil | Int |\n| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |\n| 5”  | 3+  | 3+  |  3  |  3  |  2  | 2+  |  3  | 5+  | 5+  | 6+  | 7+  |\n\n**Skills:** 1 Primary (custom).  \n**Restrictions:** None.  \n**Special Rules:** Gang Leader, Gang Hierarchy (Leader), Tools of the Trade, Group Activation (2).\n\n_It takes a lot of ruthlessness and no small talent for violence to be a Gang Queen. Those who rise to lead one of House Escher’s underhive gangs are, without exception, skilled killers and charismatic leaders, able to inspire their girls not with empty words and promises, but bloody deeds and sheer audacity. Of course the life of a Gang Queen is seldom a long one. As any Escher will tell you: the cost of living life on the edge is that eventually you fall over it._\n\n</FighterCard>\n\n<FighterCard cost=\"100\">\n\n### Gang Matriarch (Champion)\n\n|  M  | WS  | BS  |  S  |  T  |  W  |  I  |  A  | Ld  | Cl  | Wil | Int |\n| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |\n| 5”  | 3+  | 3+  |  3  |  3  |  2  | 2+  |  2  | 6+  | 6+  | 6+  | 6+  |\n\n**Skills:** 1 Primary (custom).  \n**Restrictions:** None.  \n**Special Rules:** Gang Hierarchy (Champion), Tools of the Trade, Group Activation (1).\n\n_Gang Matriarchs are drawn from the craziest, wildest and most homicidal of the Gang Queen’s girls, each one a natural killer. Favouring even more outlandish dress than most Escher, and carrying the deadliest weapons they can lay their hands on, a Matriarch is both gang enforcer, underhive assassin and debutant of death all rolled into one.

It is well known that they make extensive use of strange and exotic creatures to fuel their pharmaceutical production, and the fact that it provides the raw materials for their outlandish costumes appears to be a fortuitous by-product. Most of these xenos life forms come the House’s way legally, through sanctioned trade with the Noble Houses of the upper spires and long-standing contracts and permits allow House Escher ready access to the segmentum’s most illustrious pedigree beast breeders._\n\n_More disturbingly, perhaps, is the fact that House Escher runs a dark and hidden trade in the creation of new life from the creatures they deal in. Gene-spliced hybrids, flesh-fused chimerae and other, darker fusions of different species are commonly created. Provided that House Escher continues to avoid the use of intelligent xenos life in their experimentation, the Imperial House continues to turn a blind eye, and so these dumb monstrosities are produced and sold to the gladiatoria to entertain the crowds, kept as attack beasts to guard and protect Escher holdings, and quite often make their way into the ranks of particularly well renown Escher gangs, where they add considerably to the status of Leaders and Champions._\n\n</FighterCard>\n\n<FighterCard cost=\"120\">\n\n### 0-2 Phyrr Cat (Exotic Beast)\n\n|  M  | WS  | BS  |  S  |  T  |  W  |  I  |  A  | Ld  | Cl  | Wil | Int |\n| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |\n| 7”  | 3+  |  -  |  3  |  3  |  1  | 2+  |  2  | 7+  | 8+  | 7+  | 8+  |\n\n**Wargear:** Sharp talons (same as: Mono-hook).\n\n#### Independent\n\nMust try to remain within 9” of the owner (instead of 3”).\n\n#### Lands on the Feet\n\n-2 Strength to any falling damage.\n\n_House Escher has a long tradition of dealing in many strange and exotic off-worldcreatures. At its most basic, this trade in xenos fauna helps to fuel many of theHouse’s unique elixirs and forms no small part of the basis for its trade and expertisein alchemical technology. A side effect of this prodigious, and often illicit, tradeinxenos lifeforms, is that House Escher has access to the pelts and plumage of manywonderful beasts, and this is clearly evidenced in the Escher style of dress. It is alsonot uncommon for House Escher to bring onto Necromunda the creatures that featurein the fighting pits and gladiatoria, a trade, which in turn, enables the House toset up ever more contacts amongst the many big game hunters and Rogue Traders that specialise in such commodities._\n\n_However, not all off-world beasts are destined for the Escher laboratoria or thefightingpits of Necromunda, some creatures are prized as companions, especially thevariousfelids that originate on many different worlds. Escher gangers are attracted to thebigcats of Phyrr in particular for their exotic looks and killer instincts. Such beasts arerare in the extreme and smuggling them planetside to Hive Primus is no meanfeat, sothey are an incredibly rare sight as pets even amongst the hierarchy of HouseEscher. Yet seen they are, and when the opportunity to acquire such a beast, or even better, amating pair, arises, Escher gang queens will go to any lengths to secure them._\n\n</FighterCard>\n\n<FighterCard cost=\"50\">\n\n### 0-3 Phelynx (Exotic Beast)\n\n|  M  | WS  | BS  |  S  |  T  |  W  |  I  |  A  | Ld  | Cl  | Wil | Int |\n| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |\n| 6”  | 4+  |  -  |  3  |  3  |  1  | 3+  |  2  | 10+ | 7+  | 9+  | 11+ |\n\n#### Venomous Bite\n\nIf hitting on a 6 (before modifiers), apply Toxin.\n\n#### Untamed\n\nAll attacks have Reckless (only has unarmed attack).\n\n_House Escher has created countless gene-smithed felinoid creatures. One of the most successful is the Phelynx, or Venom Cat. A mix of reptilian biology and Phyrr Cat genes, it is an excellent hunting beast. Phelynx are used almost exclusively by the Wyld, the Runners driving entire packs of the creatures before them into battle. As their name implies, a Venom Cat’s bite can be deadly, its neuro-toxic venom able to incapacitate or kill in moments. Wyld Runners routinely apply Phelynx venom to their weapons, while some even imbibe it in small doses to build up a resistance to the toxins. Venom Cats are also naturally stealthy beasts and, like the Wyld Runners themselves, are masters of ambush. Part of this stealth comes from the creature’s instinctive grace and speed, the rest from its unique biology. Unlike Phyrr Cats, Phelynx are coldblooded, their bio-signs barely registering at all, making them extremely difficultto spot with auspexes._\n\n_The bond between Phelynx and Wyld Runner is one built over a lifetime. When an Escher juve joins the Wyld, she will be given a weapon to master or a pet to train – this often coming in the form of an infant Phelynx. Over years of hunting and battle the Escher and beast become inseparable, one able to anticipate and coordinate with the actions of the other in a way no two human gangers could ever hope to match._\n\n</FighterCard>\n\n<FighterCard cost=\"50\">\n\n### Helion (Crew)\n\n| BS  | Ld  | Cl  | Wil | Int |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 4+  | 7+  | 7+  | 7+  | 7+  |\n\n</FighterCard>\n\n## Skill Access\n\n|                            | [Agility](/docs/gang-fighters-and-their-weaponry/skills/#agility) | [Combat](/docs/gang-fighters-and-their-weaponry/skills/#combat) | [Cunning](/docs/gang-fighters-and-their-weaponry/skills/#cunning) | [Driving](/docs/gang-fighters-and-their-weaponry/skills/#driving) | [Ferocity](/docs/gang-fighters-and-their-weaponry/skills/#ferocity) | [Leadership](/docs/gang-fighters-and-their-weaponry/skills/#leadership) | [Savant](/docs/gang-fighters-and-their-weaponry/skills/#savant) | [Shooting](/docs/gang-fighters-and-their-weaponry/skills/#shooting) | [Finesse](/docs/gang-fighters-and-their-weaponry/skills/gang-specific-skills#finesse) |\n| :------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Leader                     | Primary                                                           | Primary                                                         | Secondary                                                         | -
