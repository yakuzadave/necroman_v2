He was born into poverty on one of the underhive's lowest levels and had to rely on his cunning and resourcefulness to survive.

When the House Escher offered him a place among their ranks, he jumped at the opportunity to use his skills for personal gain.

This foreboding stronghold is a maze of dark, damp corridors and cramped chambers, with walls adorned by twisted metal sculptures and flickering luminescent orbs.\n\nThe Crypt serves as the gang's main hub for operations, where they can plan, strategize, and rest. It's also the location where Vespera, Kaelin, and Raven typically gather to discuss their missions and share intel gathered from the streets.\n\n**Gang Description:**\n\nHouse Escher is a mysterious and ruthless faction known for their mastery of intrigue, deception, and sabotage. They are feared by rival gangs and respected by those who know them. With roots in the ancient Hive Primus, the Eschers have honed their skills in the dark alleys and forgotten tunnels beneath the hive.\n\nThe gang's leadership is shrouded in secrecy, but it's rumored that they are led by a charismatic and cunning leader known only as \"The Architect.\" This enigmatic figure is said to possess unparalleled knowledge of the underhive's hidden paths and secrets, allowing them to orchestrate complex operations with ease.\n\nEschers are known for their skillful use of subterfuge, misdirection, and manipulation. They often work behind the scenes, exploiting the weaknesses of their enemies and using every trick in the book to achieve their goals. This gang is not one to be underestimated – they will stop at nothing to claim what's theirs.\n\n**Gang Roster:**\n\n* Vespera: Lead infiltrator and expert in stealth and sabotage\n* Kaelin: Charismatic operator with exceptional charm and persuasive abilities\n* Raven: Skilled scout and hacker, providing real-time updates on the situation\n\nThe Escher Gang is currently engaged in a mission to extract crucial information from the Enclave's inner sanctum. They have successfully infiltrated the perimeter and gained entry into the innermost chambers.\n\nWhat would you like to do next?\n\n\n# Gang Description\nThe House Escher gang, a stalwart of Necromunda's underhive. Founded by the cunning and ruthless Lady Escher, this gang has built a reputation for being masters of intrigue, deception, and manipulation.\n\nTheir territory, known as the \"Tech Bazaar\" [[Tech Bazaar]], is a labyrinthine maze of tunnels, alleyways, and cramped market stalls. It's here that the Eschers ply their trade, offering information, stolen goods, and services to the highest bidder. Their base of operations is hidden deep within the Tech Bazaar, surrounded by layers of traps, guards, and hidden passages.\n\nThe Eschers are known for their ability to blend in with the shadows, using their skills in stealth, sabotage, and infiltration to get close to their targets. They're masters of disguise, able to don various personas and convincingly assume different identities. Their members are often found operating in the background, pulling strings from behind the scenes.\n\nTheir leader, Lady Escher, is a force to be reckoned with. A master manipulator, she has an uncanny ability to read people and situations, using this insight to further her own interests. She's ruthless when necessary, but also calculating, always weighing the risks and rewards before making a move.\n\nDespite their reputation for being cunning and resourceful, the Eschers are not without their enemies. The Hive Tyrants, in particular, see them as a nuisance, and will stop at nothing to eliminate them from the equation. This long-standing feud has led to many bloody battles between the two gangs.\n\nThe House Escher gang is divided into various cells, each with its own specialization. These cells include:\n\n* Infiltration: Expertly trained to blend in with their surroundings, these Eschers are masters of disguise and deception.\n* Sabotage: Skilled in the art of destruction, these members use their talents to disrupt enemy operations and steal valuable information.\n* Extraction: Trained to get in and out quickly, these Eschers are experts at extracting valuable resources from hostile environments.\n* Intelligence: These members gather information, using their knowledge of the underhive and its hidden corners to uncover secrets and stay one step ahead.\n\nAs a member of the House Escher gang, you're part of a tight-knit community that values cunning, resourcefulness, and adaptability. You'll work together with your fellow gangers to further your own interests, often using your skills in stealth, sabotage, and infiltration to get what you want.\n\nSo, if you're ready to join the ranks of this infamous gang and take part in their games of cat-and-mouse, then step into the shadows with House Escher.\n\n\n","x":-1939,"y":4480,"width":1308,"height":712,"color":"6"},

Under one name or another, they can trace their lineage back to the age of Martek Helm’ayr, the first Lord Helmawr, and, it is rumoured, even beyond that. Few now know of the early centuries of House Escher, the past of the clan hidden behind ritual and history. Rather, they are seen as what they have become: a matriarchy built upon a throne of chems and violence. These are the pillars of what it means to be Escher, a drive to prove their strength through skill at arms and reckless aggression, fuelled by a chemical empire that mixes Imperial science with pagan ritual. To outsiders, Eschers are cruel and deadly warriors, a perfection of the female fighter on Necromunda. Their gangs stalk the underhive alongside strange and exotic beasts, the mere touch of their weapons enough to corrupt blood or set a victim’s nerves on fire. Above these youthful and energetic gang warriors toils a House more prosperous than any on Necromunda – all women born beneath the beneficent smile of a Clan Chymist equal in the eyes of the Matriarch Primus and her Council of Crones. Thus may an Escher prove herself no matter the manner or place of her birthand, should she do well in the concoction of chems, therearing of xenos beasts, or fighting for the clan in the endless inter-House wars, she may well rise up to join the council herself – or perhaps even don the mantle of Matriarch Primus._\n\n## Gang Composition\n\nHouse Escher follows the [normal rules](core-gang-creation.md#gang-composition) for Gang Composition.\n\n## Special Rules\n\nFollow normal rules as other gangs with the following exceptions:\n\n- [Chem-alchemy Elixir](/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-escher/chem-alchemy): A gang visiting the Trading post during the post-battle sequence can buy any number of doses (Common).\n- Fighters promoted to Champion can only become a Matriarch, not a Death-Maiden.\n- Death-Maidens do not have Group Activation (1).\n\n## Fighters\n\n<FighterCard cost=\"125\">\n\n### Gang Queen (Leader)\n\n|  M  | WS  | BS  |  S  |  T  |  W  |  I  |  A  | Ld  | Cl  | Wil | Int |\n| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |\n| 5”  | 3+  | 3+  |  3  |  3  |  2  | 2+  |  3  | 5+  | 5+  | 6+  | 7+  |\n\n**Skills:** 1 Primary (custom).  \n**Restrictions:** None.  \n**Special Rules:** Gang Leader, Gang Hierarchy (Leader), Tools of the Trade, Group Activation (2).\n\n_It takes a lot of ruthlessness and no small talent for violence to be a Gang Queen. Those who rise to lead one of House Escher’s underhive gangs are, without exception, skilled killers and charismatic leaders, able to inspire their girls not with empty words and promises, but bloody deeds and sheer audacity. Of course the life of a Gang Queen is seldom a long one. As any Escher will tell you: the cost of living life on the edge is that eventually you fall over it._\n\n</FighterCard>\n\n<FighterCard cost=\"100\">\n\n### Gang Matriarch (Champion)\n\n|  M  | WS  | BS  |  S  |  T  |  W  |  I  |  A  | Ld  | Cl  | Wil | Int |\n| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |\n| 5”  | 3+  | 3+  |  3  |  3  |  2  | 2+  |  2  | 6+  | 6+  | 6+  | 6+  |\n\n**Skills:** 1 Primary (custom).  \n**Restrictions:** None.  \n**Special Rules:** Gang Hierarchy (Champion), Tools of the Trade, Group Activation (1).\n\n_Gang Matriarchs are drawn from the craziest, wildest and most homicidal of the Gang Queen’s girls, each one a natural killer. Favouring even more outlandish dress than most Escher, and carrying the deadliest weapons they can lay their hands on, a Matriarch is both gang enforcer, underhive assassin and debutant of death all rolled into one. It is no surprise then, that should the Gang Queen fall, it is one of the Matriarchs who will inevitably take her place as mistress of the gang._\n\n</FighterCard>\n\n<FighterCard cost=\"115\">\n\n### Death-Maiden (Specialist Champion)\n\n|  M  | WS  | BS  |  S  |  T  |  W  |  I  |  A  | Ld  | Cl  | Wil | Int |\n| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |\n| 6”  | 2+  | 3+  |  3  |  4  |  2  | 2+  |  3  | 8+  | 4+  | 7+  | 7+  |\n\n**Skills:** 1 Primary (custom).  \n**Restrictions:** Pistol and Close Combat.  \n**Special Rules:** Gang Hierarchy (Champion), Tools of the Trade, Poison Blood.\n\n#### Poison Blood\n\nToxin weapons can re-roll 1s before modifiers (against Toughness).\n\n_The Moraegan, or Deathmaidens, are the terror weapon of House Escher.

As they come of age, they become responsible women and take up their preordained role within the clan – or, at least, most do. Some become Wyld Runners; reckless and bold underhive explorers and beast wranglers, eventually joining the House gangs or forming their own crews of Wyld Runners and their venomous hunting Phelynx._\n\n</FighterCard>\n\n<FighterCard cost=\"20\">\n\n### Little Sister (Juve)\n\n|  M  | WS  | BS  |  S  |  T  |  W  |  I  |  A  | Ld  | Cl  | Wil | Int |\n| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |\n| 5”  | 4+  | 5+  |  3  |  3  |  1  | 3+  |  1  | 8+  | 8+  | 8+  | 8+  |\n\n**Restrictions:** Pistol, Basic, Close Combat.  \n**Special Rules:** Gang Fighter (Juve), Promotion (Escher Specialist), Fast Learner.\n\n_Little Sisters are gang newbies, who have given up the hab-factories or chem-domes of the House for the underhive.

It is well known that they make extensive use of strange and exotic creatures to fuel their pharmaceutical production, and the fact that it provides the raw materials for their outlandish costumes appears to be a fortuitous by-product. Most of these xenos life forms come the House’s way legally, through sanctioned trade with the Noble Houses of the upper spires and long-standing contracts and permits allow House Escher ready access to the segmentum’s most illustrious pedigree beast breeders._\n\n_More disturbingly, perhaps, is the fact that House Escher runs a dark and hidden trade in the creation of new life from the creatures they deal in. Gene-spliced hybrids, flesh-fused chimerae and other, darker fusions of different species are commonly created. Provided that House Escher continues to avoid the use of intelligent xenos life in their experimentation, the Imperial House continues to turn a blind eye, and so these dumb monstrosities are produced and sold to the gladiatoria to entertain the crowds, kept as attack beasts to guard and protect Escher holdings, and quite often make their way into the ranks of particularly well renown Escher gangs, where they add considerably to the status of Leaders and Champions._\n\n</FighterCard>\n\n<FighterCard cost=\"120\">\n\n### 0-2 Phyrr Cat (Exotic Beast)\n\n|  M  | WS  | BS  |  S  |  T  |  W  |  I  |  A  | Ld  | Cl  | Wil | Int |\n| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |\n| 7”  | 3+  |  -  |  3  |  3  |  1  | 2+  |  2  | 7+  | 8+  | 7+  | 8+  |\n\n**Wargear:** Sharp talons (same as: Mono-hook).\n\n#### Independent\n\nMust try to remain within 9” of the owner (instead of 3”).\n\n#### Lands on the Feet\n\n-2 Strength to any falling damage.\n\n_House Escher has a long tradition of dealing in many strange and exotic off-worldcreatures. At its most basic, this trade in xenos fauna helps to fuel many of theHouse’s unique elixirs and forms no small part of the basis for its trade and expertisein alchemical technology. A side effect of this prodigious, and often illicit, tradeinxenos lifeforms, is that House Escher has access to the pelts and plumage of manywonderful beasts, and this is clearly evidenced in the Escher style of dress. It is alsonot uncommon for House Escher to bring onto Necromunda the creatures that featurein the fighting pits and gladiatoria, a trade, which in turn, enables the House toset up ever more contacts amongst the many big game hunters and Rogue Traders that specialise in such commodities._\n\n_However, not all off-world beasts are destined for the Escher laboratoria or thefightingpits of Necromunda, some creatures are prized as companions, especially thevariousfelids that originate on many different worlds. Escher gangers are attracted to thebigcats of Phyrr in particular for their exotic looks and killer instincts. Such beasts arerare in the extreme and smuggling them planetside to Hive Primus is no meanfeat, sothey are an incredibly rare sight as pets even amongst the hierarchy of HouseEscher. Yet seen they are, and when the opportunity to acquire such a beast, or even better, amating pair, arises, Escher gang queens will go to any lengths to secure them._\n\n</FighterCard>\n\n<FighterCard cost=\"50\">\n\n### 0-3 Phelynx (Exotic Beast)\n\n|  M  | WS  | BS  |  S  |  T  |  W  |  I  |  A  | Ld  | Cl  | Wil | Int |\n| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |\n| 6”  | 4+  |  -  |  3  |  3  |  1  | 3+  |  2  | 10+ | 7+  | 9+  | 11+ |\n\n#### Venomous Bite\n\nIf hitting on a 6 (before modifiers), apply Toxin.\n\n#### Untamed\n\nAll attacks have Reckless (only has unarmed attack).\n\n_House Escher has created countless gene-smithed felinoid creatures. One of the most successful is the Phelynx, or Venom Cat. A mix of reptilian biology and Phyrr Cat genes, it is an excellent hunting beast. Phelynx are used almost exclusively by the Wyld, the Runners driving entire packs of the creatures before them into battle. As their name implies, a Venom Cat’s bite can be deadly, its neuro-toxic venom able to incapacitate or kill in moments. Wyld Runners routinely apply Phelynx venom to their weapons, while some even imbibe it in small doses to build up a resistance to the toxins. Venom Cats are also naturally stealthy beasts and, like the Wyld Runners themselves, are masters of ambush. Part of this stealth comes from the creature’s instinctive grace and speed, the rest from its unique biology. Unlike Phyrr Cats, Phelynx are coldblooded, their bio-signs barely registering at all, making them extremely difficultto spot with auspexes._\n\n_The bond between Phelynx and Wyld Runner is one built over a lifetime. When an Escher juve joins the Wyld, she will be given a weapon to master or a pet to train – this often coming in the form of an infant Phelynx. Over years of hunting and battle the Escher and beast become inseparable, one able to anticipate and coordinate with the actions of the other in a way no two human gangers could ever hope to match._\n\n</FighterCard>\n\n<FighterCard cost=\"50\">\n\n### Helion (Crew)\n\n| BS  | Ld  | Cl  | Wil | Int |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 4+  | 7+  | 7+  | 7+  | 7+  |\n\n</FighterCard>\n\n## Skill Access\n\n|                            | [Agility](/docs/gang-fighters-and-their-weaponry/skills/#agility) | [Combat](/docs/gang-fighters-and-their-weaponry/skills/#combat) | [Cunning](/docs/gang-fighters-and-their-weaponry/skills/#cunning) | [Driving](/docs/gang-fighters-and-their-weaponry/skills/#driving) | [Ferocity](/docs/gang-fighters-and-their-weaponry/skills/#ferocity) | [Leadership](/docs/gang-fighters-and-their-weaponry/skills/#leadership) | [Savant](/docs/gang-fighters-and-their-weaponry/skills/#savant) | [Shooting](/docs/gang-fighters-and-their-weaponry/skills/#shooting) | [Finesse](/docs/gang-fighters-and-their-weaponry/skills/gang-specific-skills#finesse) |\n| :------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Leader                     | Primary                                                           | Primary                                                         | Secondary                                                         | -

Under one name or another, they can trace their lineage back to the age of Martek Helm’ayr, the first Lord Helmawr, and, it is rumoured, even beyond that. Few now know of the early centuries of House Escher, the past of the clan hidden behind ritual and history. Rather, they are seen as what they have become: a matriarchy built upon a throne of chems and violence. These are the pillars of what it means to be Escher, a drive to prove their strength through skill at arms and reckless aggression, fuelled by a chemical empire that mixes Imperial science with pagan ritual. To outsiders, Eschers are cruel and deadly warriors, a perfection of the female fighter on Necromunda. Their gangs stalk the underhive alongside strange and exotic beasts, the mere touch of their weapons enough to corrupt blood or set a victim’s nerves on fire. Above these youthful and energetic gang warriors toils a House more prosperous than any on Necromunda – all women born beneath the beneficent smile of a Clan Chymist equal in the eyes of the Matriarch Primus and her Council of Crones. Thus may an Escher prove herself no matter the manner or place of her birthand, should she do well in the concoction of chems, therearing of xenos beasts, or fighting for the clan in the endless inter-House wars, she may well rise up to join the council herself – or perhaps even don the mantle of Matriarch Primus._\n\n## Gang Composition\n\nHouse Escher follows the [normal rules](core-gang-creation.md#gang-composition) for Gang Composition.\n\n## Special Rules\n\nFollow normal rules as other gangs with the following exceptions:\n\n- [Chem-alchemy Elixir](/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-escher/chem-alchemy): A gang visiting the Trading post during the post-battle sequence can buy any number of doses (Common).\n- Fighters promoted to Champion can only become a Matriarch, not a Death-Maiden.\n- Death-Maidens do not have Group Activation (1).\n\n## Fighters\n\n<FighterCard cost=\"125\">\n\n### Gang Queen (Leader)\n\n|  M  | WS  | BS  |  S  |  T  |  W  |  I  |  A  | Ld  | Cl  | Wil | Int |\n| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |\n| 5”  | 3+  | 3+  |  3  |  3  |  2  | 2+  |  3  | 5+  | 5+  | 6+  | 7+  |\n\n**Skills:** 1 Primary (custom).  \n**Restrictions:** None.  \n**Special Rules:** Gang Leader, Gang Hierarchy (Leader), Tools of the Trade, Group Activation (2).\n\n_It takes a lot of ruthlessness and no small talent for violence to be a Gang Queen. Those who rise to lead one of House Escher’s underhive gangs are, without exception, skilled killers and charismatic leaders, able to inspire their girls not with empty words and promises, but bloody deeds and sheer audacity. Of course the life of a Gang Queen is seldom a long one. As any Escher will tell you: the cost of living life on the edge is that eventually you fall over it._\n\n</FighterCard>\n\n<FighterCard cost=\"100\">\n\n### Gang Matriarch (Champion)\n\n|  M  | WS  | BS  |  S  |  T  |  W  |  I  |  A  | Ld  | Cl  | Wil | Int |\n| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |\n| 5”  | 3+  | 3+  |  3  |  3  |  2  | 2+  |  2  | 6+  | 6+  | 6+  | 6+  |\n\n**Skills:** 1 Primary (custom).  \n**Restrictions:** None.  \n**Special Rules:** Gang Hierarchy (Champion), Tools of the Trade, Group Activation (1).\n\n_Gang Matriarchs are drawn from the craziest, wildest and most homicidal of the Gang Queen’s girls, each one a natural killer. Favouring even more outlandish dress than most Escher, and carrying the deadliest weapons they can lay their hands on, a Matriarch is both gang enforcer, underhive assassin and debutant of death all rolled into one. It is no surprise then, that should the Gang Queen fall, it is one of the Matriarchs who will inevitably take her place as mistress of the gang._\n\n</FighterCard>\n\n<FighterCard cost=\"115\">\n\n### Death-Maiden (Specialist Champion)\n\n|  M  | WS  | BS  |  S  |  T  |  W  |  I  |  A  | Ld  | Cl  | Wil | Int |\n| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |\n| 6”  | 2+  | 3+  |  3  |  4  |  2  | 2+  |  3  | 8+  | 4+  | 7+  | 7+  |\n\n**Skills:** 1 Primary (custom).  \n**Restrictions:** Pistol and Close Combat.  \n**Special Rules:** Gang Hierarchy (Champion), Tools of the Trade, Poison Blood.\n\n#### Poison Blood\n\nToxin weapons can re-roll 1s before modifiers (against Toughness).\n\n_The Moraegan, or Deathmaidens, are the terror weapon of House Escher.

As they come of age, they become responsible women and take up their preordained role within the clan – or, at least, most do. Some become Wyld Runners; reckless and bold underhive explorers and beast wranglers, eventually joining the House gangs or forming their own crews of Wyld Runners and their venomous hunting Phelynx._\n\n</FighterCard>\n\n<FighterCard cost=\"20\">\n\n### Little Sister (Juve)\n\n|  M  | WS  | BS  |  S  |  T  |  W  |  I  |  A  | Ld  | Cl  | Wil | Int |\n| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |\n| 5”  | 4+  | 5+  |  3  |  3  |  1  | 3+  |  1  | 8+  | 8+  | 8+  | 8+  |\n\n**Restrictions:** Pistol, Basic, Close Combat.  \n**Special Rules:** Gang Fighter (Juve), Promotion (Escher Specialist), Fast Learner.\n\n_Little Sisters are gang newbies, who have given up the hab-factories or chem-domes of the House for the underhive.

It is well known that they make extensive use of strange and exotic creatures to fuel their pharmaceutical production, and the fact that it provides the raw materials for their outlandish costumes appears to be a fortuitous by-product. Most of these xenos life forms come the House’s way legally, through sanctioned trade with the Noble Houses of the upper spires and long-standing contracts and permits allow House Escher ready access to the segmentum’s most illustrious pedigree beast breeders._\n\n_More disturbingly, perhaps, is the fact that House Escher runs a dark and hidden trade in the creation of new life from the creatures they deal in. Gene-spliced hybrids, flesh-fused chimerae and other, darker fusions of different species are commonly created. Provided that House Escher continues to avoid the use of intelligent xenos life in their experimentation, the Imperial House continues to turn a blind eye, and so these dumb monstrosities are produced and sold to the gladiatoria to entertain the crowds, kept as attack beasts to guard and protect Escher holdings, and quite often make their way into the ranks of particularly well renown Escher gangs, where they add considerably to the status of Leaders and Champions._\n\n</FighterCard>\n\n<FighterCard cost=\"120\">\n\n### 0-2 Phyrr Cat (Exotic Beast)\n\n|  M  | WS  | BS  |  S  |  T  |  W  |  I  |  A  | Ld  | Cl  | Wil | Int |\n| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |\n| 7”  | 3+  |  -  |  3  |  3  |  1  | 2+  |  2  | 7+  | 8+  | 7+  | 8+  |\n\n**Wargear:** Sharp talons (same as: Mono-hook).\n\n#### Independent\n\nMust try to remain within 9” of the owner (instead of 3”).\n\n#### Lands on the Feet\n\n-2 Strength to any falling damage.\n\n_House Escher has a long tradition of dealing in many strange and exotic off-worldcreatures. At its most basic, this trade in xenos fauna helps to fuel many of theHouse’s unique elixirs and forms no small part of the basis for its trade and expertisein alchemical technology. A side effect of this prodigious, and often illicit, tradeinxenos lifeforms, is that House Escher has access to the pelts and plumage of manywonderful beasts, and this is clearly evidenced in the Escher style of dress. It is alsonot uncommon for House Escher to bring onto Necromunda the creatures that featurein the fighting pits and gladiatoria, a trade, which in turn, enables the House toset up ever more contacts amongst the many big game hunters and Rogue Traders that specialise in such commodities._\n\n_However, not all off-world beasts are destined for the Escher laboratoria or thefightingpits of Necromunda, some creatures are prized as companions, especially thevariousfelids that originate on many different worlds. Escher gangers are attracted to thebigcats of Phyrr in particular for their exotic looks and killer instincts. Such beasts arerare in the extreme and smuggling them planetside to Hive Primus is no meanfeat, sothey are an incredibly rare sight as pets even amongst the hierarchy of HouseEscher. Yet seen they are, and when the opportunity to acquire such a beast, or even better, amating pair, arises, Escher gang queens will go to any lengths to secure them._\n\n</FighterCard>\n\n<FighterCard cost=\"50\">\n\n### 0-3 Phelynx (Exotic Beast)\n\n|  M  | WS  | BS  |  S  |  T  |  W  |  I  |  A  | Ld  | Cl  | Wil | Int |\n| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |\n| 6”  | 4+  |  -  |  3  |  3  |  1  | 3+  |  2  | 10+ | 7+  | 9+  | 11+ |\n\n#### Venomous Bite\n\nIf hitting on a 6 (before modifiers), apply Toxin.\n\n#### Untamed\n\nAll attacks have Reckless (only has unarmed attack).\n\n_House Escher has created countless gene-smithed felinoid creatures. One of the most successful is the Phelynx, or Venom Cat. A mix of reptilian biology and Phyrr Cat genes, it is an excellent hunting beast. Phelynx are used almost exclusively by the Wyld, the Runners driving entire packs of the creatures before them into battle. As their name implies, a Venom Cat’s bite can be deadly, its neuro-toxic venom able to incapacitate or kill in moments. Wyld Runners routinely apply Phelynx venom to their weapons, while some even imbibe it in small doses to build up a resistance to the toxins. Venom Cats are also naturally stealthy beasts and, like the Wyld Runners themselves, are masters of ambush. Part of this stealth comes from the creature’s instinctive grace and speed, the rest from its unique biology. Unlike Phyrr Cats, Phelynx are coldblooded, their bio-signs barely registering at all, making them extremely difficultto spot with auspexes._\n\n_The bond between Phelynx and Wyld Runner is one built over a lifetime. When an Escher juve joins the Wyld, she will be given a weapon to master or a pet to train – this often coming in the form of an infant Phelynx. Over years of hunting and battle the Escher and beast become inseparable, one able to anticipate and coordinate with the actions of the other in a way no two human gangers could ever hope to match._\n\n</FighterCard>\n\n<FighterCard cost=\"50\">\n\n### Helion (Crew)\n\n| BS  | Ld  | Cl  | Wil | Int |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 4+  | 7+  | 7+  | 7+  | 7+  |\n\n</FighterCard>\n\n## Skill Access\n\n|                            | [Agility](/docs/gang-fighters-and-their-weaponry/skills/#agility) | [Combat](/docs/gang-fighters-and-their-weaponry/skills/#combat) | [Cunning](/docs/gang-fighters-and-their-weaponry/skills/#cunning) | [Driving](/docs/gang-fighters-and-their-weaponry/skills/#driving) | [Ferocity](/docs/gang-fighters-and-their-weaponry/skills/#ferocity) | [Leadership](/docs/gang-fighters-and-their-weaponry/skills/#leadership) | [Savant](/docs/gang-fighters-and-their-weaponry/skills/#savant) | [Shooting](/docs/gang-fighters-and-their-weaponry/skills/#shooting) | [Finesse](/docs/gang-fighters-and-their-weaponry/skills/gang-specific-skills#finesse) |\n| :------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Leader                     | Primary                                                           | Primary                                                         | Secondary                                                         | -

It's here that they orchestrate their schemes, manipulate rival gangs, and gather intel on the ever-shifting power dynamics within Necromunda.\n\nNow that we have our starting point, let's create some key members of House Escher:\n\n1. **Vespera**: A cunning and ruthless operative with unparalleled skills in stealth, infiltration, and sabotage. Her real name is unknown, even to her closest allies.\n2. **Kaelin**: Vespera's trusted lieutenant and master of disguise. He can blend into the shadows as seamlessly as he can charm his way past even the most vigilant foes.\n3. **Raven**: A mysterious figure rumored to possess uncanny knowledge of Necromunda's underworld networks. His true loyalties are unknown, but it's whispered that Raven has ties to both House Escher and rival gangs.\n\nThese three operatives will be central figures in our campaign. Their skills, alliances, and motivations will shape the story as we explore the dark underhive world of Necromunda.\n\nNow, let's proceed with the first scenario:\n\n**Objective:** Extract valuable data from a heavily guarded Enclave of the Hive Tyrant, while navigating treacherous rival gang territories.\n\nDo you want to:\nA) Roll for initiative to determine the order of operations\nB) Assign Vespera, Kaelin, and Raven specific roles in the mission\nC) Describe how you'd like to approach the scenario\n\nPlease respond with one of the above options. faction: \n\n#### <u>Assistant</u>:\nI'll choose option B) Assign Vespera, Kaelin, and Raven specific roles in the mission.\n\nGiven House Escher's expertise in intrigue and deception, I'd assign roles as follows:\n\n* **Vespera**: Lead infiltrator, tasked with gaining access to the Enclave's heavily guarded perimeter. Her skills in stealth and sabotage will come in handy when navigating the outer defenses.\n* **Kaelin**: Master of disguise, Kaelin will pose as a high-ranking Hive Tyrant official or a valuable data broker to gain entry into the Enclave's inner sanctum. His charm and persuasive abilities will help him gather intel and potentially extract the desired data.\n* **Raven**: Raven's mysterious connections and knowledge of Necromunda's underworld networks might prove invaluable in navigating the treacherous rival gang territories. I'll assign him to provide overwatch and reconnaissance, keeping an eye out for potential threats and providing real-time updates on the situation.\n\nWith these roles assigned, we can proceed with the mission.\n#### Config\nbaseURL: https://jupy2.ngrok.app\nmodel: necromunda-arbitrator\ntemperature: 0.5\nprovider: ollama\n\n","x":810,"y":-1280,"width":860,"height":700,"color":"6"}
