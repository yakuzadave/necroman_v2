Subject: A Heartfelt Apology Regarding the Unfortunate Absence of Altoids

Dear Valued Customer,

I hope this email finds you in the best of spirits, despite the impending doom that is to come. I'm writing to inform you, with a heavy heart and a sense of deep regret, that we have fallen short in our most fundamental responsibility: providing an adequate supply of altoids.

Yes, it pains me to admit that our storerooms are currently bereft of these tiny, yet mighty, treats. The thought of not being able to offer you the sweet, tangy delight that is altoids weighs heavily upon my conscience. I can only imagine the sense of betrayal and disappointment that must be coursing through your veins as you read these words.

Please know that we are truly, deeply sorry for this egregious oversight. It's a mistake that will haunt me forevermore, like a ghostly whisper in the dead of night. We should have seen it coming; we should have anticipated the insatiable demand and prepared accordingly. Alas, we did not, and now you must suffer the consequences.

As a token of our abject apology, I am offering you a special discount on your next purchase of, well, anything else. Yes, it's a small consolation, but one that we hope will ease the sting of our altoid-less existence.

If you have any further questions or concerns (and I'm sure you do), please don't hesitate to reach out. We'll do our best to address them, even if it means conjuring up some makeshift substitute for these delectable morsels.

Once again, we offer our most sincere apologies for this altoid-less nightmare. May the sweet memories of better times console your troubled soul.

Yours in contrition,

[Your Name]

P.S. If you'd like to send a strongly worded letter or a passionate plea for us to restock on altoids, please feel free to do so. We'll treasure each and every one as a reminder of our transgressions.
