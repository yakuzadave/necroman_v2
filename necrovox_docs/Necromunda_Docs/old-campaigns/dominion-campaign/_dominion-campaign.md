# Dominion Campaign

_Power in the underhive is more than a gun in a ganger’s hand. It is reputation, it is coin, and the worth of the ground that you can call your own. For gangs that wish for more than bloodshed, that wish not just for infamy, but to rise from the ashes and ruins to something greater; for these, dominion over the soul and iron of the hive is everything. And for that end, they will fight bitter war without mercy._

## How The Campaign Works

The Dominion Campaign is based around gangs
fighting battles for the control of Territory. Each game
in the campaign is fought for the control of a Territory,
with the winner either gaining a new Territory, or
holding onto one that they already have. The Territory
being fought over is the stake of a game, and every
game has a Territory at stake on the outcome.

Territories are features of the underhive that are
worth something to the gangs, be that a set of
old ruins that provide building materials or a safe
haven, or a tech bazaar selling all manner of STC technology. There are a fixed number of Territories in a Dominion Campaign, based on the number
of players.

Possession of a Territory grants a gang that holds it
a benefit – called a Boon. Boons vary from income,
to a special Tactic that can be used in battle, to equipment, or even recruits for their gang. Gangs claim Territories by winning battles.

All gangs possess a Settlement Territory which they cannot lose and which can never be staked on the outcome of a battle. This represents the gang hide-out.

The campaign ends after a fixed period of time, and at that point gangs are awarded Triumphs based on how many battles they have fought, how much Territory they have, how wealthy they are, their Reputation, and how many enemies they have taken down.

## Starting Out

**Starting credits:** 1000  
**Keep unspent credits:** Yes

In addition, most gangs starts with a Settlement which is permanent and can never be lost (their gang hideout). The following gangs start with a special Territory instead of this settlement:

- Enforcers (Palanite & Badzone): Palanite Precinct
- Ash Waste Nomads: Nomad's Outpost

## Phases

### Phase 1: Occupation

Each battle is rewarded by a single uncontrolled Territory. The gangs decide which currently available Territory is at stake when issuing and accepting challenges.

If there are no more uncontrolled Territories, the phase ends and Downtime begins. This does not change the length of the Downtime, but Phase 3 can be extended if Phase 1 ends early.

### Phase 2: Downtime

Complete the following steps:

1. [Fighters Recover](/docs/campaigns/dominion-campaign/running-the-campaign#a-fighters-recover)
2. [Captives are Returned](/docs/campaigns/dominion-campaign/running-the-campaign#b-captives-are-returned)
3. [Experienced Juves are Promoted](/docs/campaigns/dominion-campaign/running-the-campaign#c-experienced-juves-and-prospects-are-promoted)
4. [Fresh Recruitment](/docs/campaigns/dominion-campaign/running-the-campaign#d-fresh-recruitment)

### Phase 3: Takeover

Any number of battles may be fought in this phase. The challengers can continue to nominate unclaimed Territories as the stake of a battle, or challenge others to their existing territories.

## Ending the Campaign

After Phase 3, the campaign ends. There are a number of Triumphs (depending on campaign type). A gang may earn more than one, and in case of a tie, no one is awarded it.

New Splinter gangs created based on the old gain bonuses for the next cycle. Triumphs only last for a single cycle.

## Trading

In a Dominion campaign you have access to the Trading post, but _not_ the Black Market.

:::note
In the [Necrodamus Trading Post](/docs/reference-tables/trading-post/basic-weapons), Black Market items are listed in _italics_. On Yaktribe, you can set the 'Illegal' slider to 1, however some Common Black Market items will still be visible.

## Gang-Specific Resources

The following gangs start with special permanent Territories instead of a starting Settlement:

- Enforcers (Palanite & Badzone): Palanite Precinct
- Ash Waste Nomads: Nomad's Outpost

### Defending the Homeground

These Territories act different to a gang's home Settlement: they can be challenged.

If this Territory is the stake of a battle:

- Use Zone Mortalis terrain (if possible, otherwise use Sector Mechanicus).
- Home Turf Advantage:
  - **Bottle tests:** Roll 2D6 and discard the highest.
  - **Rally tests:** +1.
  - **Hangers-on:** Included in the crew on a 4+ (roll individually).
- The challenged gang sets up all terrain (tiles, doors, barricades and anything else). All doors can be locked, the challenged gang can treat them as unlocked and can re-lock them.

### Gang Assault (Losing the Challenge)

If this Territory is the stake of a battle and the challenger wins:

- Winner: +5 Rep.
- Loser: -5 Rep (only Palanite & Badzone Enforcers).
- The Resource is not lost.

## Existing Gangs

Existing gangs rejoining from a perpetual campaign can retain 1 Resource per 1000 Gang Rating.

## Venator Bounty Hunters

Venator Bounty Hunter counts as the gang of the Leader’s House Legacy. If the Leader don’t have a House Legacy, the gang can't claim any gang specific benefits.

:::note Underhive Perils within Dominion Territories
Some Underhive Perils are particularly suitable for adding great flavour to battles fought over some of the Territories:

| Territory           | Underhive Perils                                                  |

## Campaign Variants

### Old Kingdoms

Start with 2 random Resources from those drawn for the campaign. The remainder are the unclaimed Resources. There is no Phase 1 in this variant. Instead, start and end with Phase 3 (3 cycles each), separated by one cycle of Downtime.

### Into the Unknown

Instead of revealing Resources, they are kept secret. Uncontrolled Resources are only revealed when being fought over. In Phase 3, battles are either fought over revealed Resources held by gangs, or unrevealed uncontrolled Resources.

### Extending the Campaign

The length of the campaign can become longer by increasing the number of cycles in each phase or introducing multiples of Phase 1 and Phase 3, separated by Downtime.

For example Phase 1, Downtime, Phase 3, Downtime, Phase 1, Downtime, Phase 3.

### Splinter Gangs

Normally, gangs can't continue past the campaign to maintain a degree of balance. However, splinter gangs may be founded. Choose one Champion from an existing gang and hire them as the Leader of a new gang, keeping all of their equipment, Advancements and permanent injuries, and paying their Credits value to hire them. This Champion’s Type is simply changed to Leader and is treated as such in all regards.

Further to this, Juves and Specialists can be recruited from an old gang in the same way, changing their type to Champion. Gangers can be hired again as Gangers. New fighters can be hired to fill out the ranks and help keep the cost down. Splinter cells must abide by the same gang composition rules as a freshly founded gang, and is limited to the same credits as new gangs.

## Scenario Selection

:::note

It is up to the campaign to organise how they want to choose scenarios. Each gaming group is different and have different approaches. One option is to use the selection table suggested by the campaign designers below.

:::

To determine which scenario will be used, roll 2D6on the following table:

| &nbsp;&nbsp;2D6&nbsp;&nbsp; | Result                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

If the scenario dictates there is an attacker and a defender, the player who chose the scenario decides which player will be the attacker and which will be the defender.                                       |
