# Uprising Campaign


- _The baleful gaze of the Lord of Skin and Sinew has fallen upon Hive Arcos, driving its people to savage hunger and bloody madness. Gangs must choose the role they are to play in the carnage to follow, either clinging to the ideals of the Imperium and the rule of law, or giving in to their basest instincts and surrendering themselves to the whims of the Blood God!_

:::note Designer's Note

Whilst the Uprising Campaign is designed to allow players to recreate the events within doomed Hive Arcos, players can use these rules to represent a similar, small scale uprising in almost any hive. Players may even wish to play an Uprising Campaign with gangs they have used in another campaign, representing such dire periods of civil unrest on a more local scale.

:::

## How The Campaign Works

The Uprising Campaign is a complete narrative campaign that can be used alongside the Necromunda rules. It incorporates many of the existing Necromunda campaign rules, adding additional special rules to capture the desperate decline of a hive in the grips of a Chaos uprising and the breakdown of imperial law.

In the Uprising Campaign, players take on sides, allying themsleves with the Imperial authority, offering their allegiance to the Dark Gods, or (at least in the beginning) attempting to remain neutral, looking out solely for their own interests. As the campaign progresses and the cannibal apocalypse unfolds, the power of one side or the other will wane, until a breaking point is reached, and a final battle to determine the fate of the hive is played.

## Allegiances

All gangs must have an allegiance when founded.

There are 3 types:

- Order
- Chaos
- Unaligned

Some gangs must always start with a specific allegiance, others can choose one. Some gangs can switch during the campaign, others cannot.

| Gang Type              | Starting Allegiance             | Switched Allegiance   |
| :--------------------- | :------------------------------ | :-------------------- |
| House Gangs            | Order<br />Chaos<br />Unaligned | Any<br />Any<br />Any |
| Tainted House Gangs    | Chaos                           | N/A                   |
| Genestealer Cult       | Order                           | N/A                   |
| Chaos Cult             | Chaos                           | N/A                   |
| Corpse Grinder Cult    | Chaos                           | N/A                   |
| Venator Bounty Hunters | Order<br />Chaos<br />Unaligned | Any<br />Any<br />Any |
| Enforcers              | Order                           | N/A                   |
| Slave Ogryns           | ?                               | ?                     |

## Changing Allegiances

Normally gangs can't change sides (too keep things simple). However, if everyone agrees, use the following rules to determine when gangs change side. Once a gang has changed sides, it can't change again.

#### Order

- 3 or more fighters become Chaos Spawn as a result of Festering Injuries.

#### Chaos

- 3 or more Captured fighters are returned to the gang willingly by the Captors (not recovered as part of the Public Execution scenario).

## Always Order Versus Chaos

In each battle, one side will always take the side of Order and other Chaos. If the two sides are not Order and Chaos, one gang will fight for a side they do not have Allegiance to:

## Ascendancy

Order starts with Ascendancy in the first cycle of phase 1.<br />
Chaos starts with Ascendancy in the first cycle of phase 3.

At the end of each cycle, the side that won most battles gains Ascendancy for the next cycle. In case of a tie, Ascendancy stays on on the side that have it.

Roll a D6 before each battle and apply the effects (depending on which side has Ascendancy) to all participating gangs.

## Challenges

If the winner of a battle inflicted 3 times as many Out of Action results as was suffered (not counting models that left the battlefield voluntarily or fled), then capture a random Resource from the loser.

No Resources change hands if the opponent only has the permanent Resource remaining.

## Territories

Provide 2 sets of benefits:

- Order
- Ruined

Only one of these sets are available at any time, depending of the state of the Territory. Once a resource has been ruined, it remains ruined for the rest of the campaign.

Some benefits require certain rules to be in effect:

- Starvation: Meat portions.
- Scavenging: Scavenger rolls.

If the rules are not in effect, the benefits are ignored.

## Trading

In a Dominion campaign there is no access to the Trading Post or the Black Market.

## Starting Out

**Starting credits:** 1000  
**Keep unspent credits:** Yes

In addition, each gang starts with 2 random Territories and their permanent Settlement (which cannot be lost).

The following gangs replace this Settlement:

- Enforcer: Precinct Fortress.
- Corpse Grinder Cult: Chaos Fane.
- Chaos Cult: Chaos Fane.

:::note
It's also assumed that Ash Waste Nomads replace the settlement with their Nomad's Outpost, like in a Dominion campaign.

:::

## Phase 1: Insurrection

Earn Resource rewards at the start of each cycle. Each cycle Chaos gains Ascendancy, each gang must choose a Territory to become Ruined.

### Phase 2: Downtime

Complete the following steps:

1. [Fighters Recover](/docs/campaigns/dominion-campaign/running-the-campaign#a-fighters-recover)
2. [Captives are Returned](/docs/campaigns/dominion-campaign/running-the-campaign#b-captives-are-returned)
3. [Experienced Juves are Promoted](/docs/campaigns/dominion-campaign/running-the-campaign#c-experienced-juves-and-prospects-are-promoted)
4. [Fresh Recruitment](/docs/campaigns/dominion-campaign/running-the-campaign#d-fresh-recruitment)

## Phase 3: Damnation

All Resources become Ruined (if not Ruined already).

Apply the following rules:

- Scavenging
- Starvation
- Festering Injuries

Chaos begins with Ascendancy.

Gangs can no longer (during the post-battle sequence):

- Re-equip from the Equipment List.
- Recruit new fighters, Hired Guns and Hangers-on.
- Medical Escorts to the Doc costs D3 Meat portions instead of credits.

‘Trade’ fighters into Meat portions (one-to-one basis):

- 1 Meat portion per Captive (after having a chance to be rescued).
- 1 Meat portion per ‘retired’ fighter.

Scenario rewards:

- Do not earn any credits!
- +1 Meat Portion per enemy fighter OoA.
- +1 Scavenging Roll for winning.
- +1 Scavenging roll per Loot (counter/casket) claimed (in addition to normal loot rewards).

## Scavenging (Phase 3)

Scavenging rolls can be gained from scenarios, Resources or other rewards. Each Scavenging roll can be used to roll once on the Scavenging table after any battle. Any number of available Scavenging rolls can be made simultaneously or stashed.

| 2D6   | Scavenging                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ----- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 2-3   | **Unfortunate Encounter**<br />A random fighter suffers a Lasting Injury roll.                                                                                                  |
| 4-5   | **Paid in Blood**<br />A random fighter suffers a Lasting Injury roll.<br />Spend 3D6 credits on items from the House Weapon List.                                              |
| 6-7   | **Useful Scrap**<br />Spend D6x10 on a single item from the House Weapon List.                                                                                                  |
| 8-9   | **Hidden Cache**<br />Spend D6x10 credits on items from the House Weapon List.                                                                                                  |
| 10-11 | **Band of Survivors**<br /> Gain a free Ganger including additional items worth 2D6x10 credits from the House Weapon List.                                                      |
| 12    | **Lost Holestead**<br />Roll a D6:<ul><li>1-5: Gain a free Ganger.</li><li>6: Gain a free Champion.</li></ul>Includes 4D6x10 credits worth of items from the House Weapon List. |

## Starvation (Phase 3)

Meat can be gained from scenarios, Resources or other rewards.

- Gangs must feed each fighter with 1 Meat portion after each battle (including after the last battle before Starvation comes into effect) to stave off hunger.
- Meat portions can be ‘acquired’ from fighters on a 1-for-1 basis:
  - ‘Retired’ fighter.
  - Captured fighter (require a chance to be rescued as normal).
  - Free recruits (from Resources, Scavenging etc.).
- If a fighter is turned into meat, the weapons and wargear are added to the gang’s Stash.

### Starving

If the gang can't feed a fighter (or choose not to), the fighter gains the Starvation condition. Fighters remain Starving until eating a portion of Meat after a battle or cannibalise a downed opponent. Starvation has the following effects:

- -1 S (for Strength tests, unarmed attacks and Melee weapons).
- Can make the Cannibalise (Basic) action.
- Must pass a Willpower test when activating if a Seriously Injured fighter (friend & foe) is within maximum Charge range, or Charge the Seriously Injured fighter and perform a Cannibalise (Basic) action. If the target can’t be reached (for any reason), use the activation to move as close as possible to the downed fighter.
- If a Coup de Grace action can be made (against an enemy), the fighter must instead make a Cannibalise action.

:::info Cannibalise (Basic)
Must be used instead of a Fight (Basic) or Coup de Grace (Basic) action. The target must be Seriously Injured. The attacker loses the Starvation condition. The target suffers a Lasting Injury roll with modifications:

|                              |                                    |                                         |
| :--------------------------- | :--------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------- |
| **11 (Lesson Learned):**     | Counts as 11-26 (Out Cold).        | The fighter remains on the battlefield. |
| **12-56:**                   | Apply the original Lasting Injury. | The fighter remains on the battlefield. |
| **61-65 (Critical Injury):** | Apply the original Lasting Injury. | The fighter goes Out of Action.         |
| **66 (Memorable Death):**    | Apply the original Lasting Injury. | The fighter goes Out of Action.         |

:::

## Festering Injuries (Phase 3)

All fighters from all gangs have additional effects (Mutations) when suffering Lasting Injuries.

If a Lasting Injury has a Mutation effect, roll a D6 and apply the following modifiers:

- +1 if inflicted by a fighter aligned to Chaos.
- +1 inflicted in a cycle where Chaos is in Ascendancy.
- +1 if Starving.

If the result is 6+, the Lasting Injury is replaced by a Mutation. Each mutation can only be gained once. If the mutation is a duplicate, choose another.

When a fighter gain a number of Mutations equal to the Toughness, they become a Chaos Spawn. If the gang is a Chaos Cult, Corpse Grinder Cult or Corrupted gang, it is added to the gang.

## Uprising Campaign Events

Can be used at the start of each cycle. Affects the whole cycle. Roll a D66 or select an event that suits the current state.

| D66 | Campaign Event                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
