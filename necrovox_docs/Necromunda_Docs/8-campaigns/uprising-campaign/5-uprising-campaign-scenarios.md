# Uprising Campaign Scenarios

_Source: Necromunda: Apocrypha Necromunda (2024)_

The Uprising Campaign is a struggle between the brutal
rule of the Imperium and the subversive cults that
seek to tear it down. At the beginning of the campaign,
Imperial law firmly holds the denizens of the hive in
their place, and the rebels must use stealth, sedition
and guerrilla warfare to erode the control of their
enemies. For the Enforcers of Lord Helmawr’s rule,
their task is to hunt down and burn out the cancerous
elements of the uprising – before it is too late…

To capture the feel of a hive descending into
lawlessness, the Uprising Campaign uses a collection
of unique scenarios. Whenever gangs meet to fight
for the fate of the hive, they use one of the scenarios
detailed in this section, the outcome of which
determines whether or not the iron fist of the Imperium
retains its grip, or the servants of the Dark Gods
advance their schemes.

## Order Or Chaos

In an Uprising Campaign scenario, one side will take on
the role of Order, fighting to preserve the hive, and the
other Chaos, seeking to bring it to ruin. Even in games
between gangs of the same Allegiance (see page 78),
one side will represent Order and the other Chaos, as
during the mayhem of a hive-wide rebellion, sides may
find themselves unwittingly aiding their enemies or
turning on their allies out of fear. Before generating a
scenario, players will need to work out who is fighting
for which side using the guidelines below:

Gangs fight for their Allegiance, so a Chaos gang
represents Chaos and an Order gang represents Order.

Unaligned gangs (see page 78) represent the opposing
Allegiance, so if an Unaligned gang is fighting a Chaos
gang then the Unaligned gang is fighting for Order.

If both gangs have the same Allegiance, or are both
Unaligned, then the players roll a D6, re-rolling any
ties. The player who rolled highest uses their gang’s
Allegiance (or may choose if their gang is Unaligned)
and their opponent fights for the opposing Allegiance.
For example, if two Chaos gangs fight each other, the
winner of the roll-off represents Chaos, while their
opponent represents Order.

## Scenario Rewards

Each scenario provides rewards, such as Experience,
credits or Meat for the gangs playing it. At the end
of the game, players should consult the scenario
and see if they qualify for any of its rewards, adding
them to their gang rosters if they do. Some rewards
only apply depending on the phase of the campaign
– Insurrection or Damnation – and are noted in the
scenario descriptions.

## Capturing Territories

During an Uprising Campaign, war rages throughout
the hive, with settlements, strongholds and entire
districts changing hands in the aftermath of bloody
battles. Each time two gangs fight each other, there
is a chance that the victor might take a Territory from
their opponent. At the end of the game, if the winning
gang inflicted three times as many Out of Action results
on their opponent as they themselves suffered (not
counting models that left the battlefield voluntarily or
fled because of a failed Bottle check) then they capture
one of their opponent’s Territories.

Randomly select one of the losing gang’s Territories for
the victor to claim; remembering that a gang’s home
base or hideout can never be captured. If a gang’s
only Territory is their home base or hideout then no
Territories change hands. See page 88 for more details
on Uprising Territories.
