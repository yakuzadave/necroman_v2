# Setting Up The Campaign

_Source: Necromunda: Apocrypha Necromunda (2024)_

Setting up an Uprising Campaign is a task that falls to the Arbitrator. To set up the
campaign, the Arbitrator must make sure that all of the players have founded their
gang and chosen their Allegiance (or decided to begin the campaign unaligned). This
is best done in a single evening or session where everyone playing in the campaign
meets and goes through all the steps of setting up the campaign together and
generally gets excited about the fun ahead.

### Set Start And End Dates

The Uprising Campaign is divided into six campaign cycles, separated by a single
cycle of Downtime after the first three cycles, meaning that the campaign will last a
total of seven cycles. For ease, we have set each cycle as a week, as this is usually
how often gaming groups or groups of friends get together to play. However,
if the players choose, a cycle can represent a longer or shorter period of real time.
The first step in setting up the campaign is for the Arbitrator to determine the start
date, the end date and when the Downtime cycle will fall. They then share this
information with the players.

### Alternative Uprisings

There are many insidious cults operating deep within the underhive. Although
this supplement focuses on Corpse Grinder Cult uprisings, players may wish to
experiment with other types of insurrection. Genestealer Cult gangs and Helot
Chaos Cult gangs both make fine participants in an Uprising Campaign.

### Founding Gangs

Before the campaign begins, each player must found a gang using the rules
presented in the Necromunda Core Rulebook. The Uprising Campaign is designed to
be played using only Underhive battles, though if the Arbitrator wishes,
Ash Wastes battles can be included.

### Completing a Gang Roster

When playing in an Uprising Campaign, players will need to complete a gang roster.
The Uprising Campaign roster tracks additional information compared to the one
provided in the Necromunda Core Rulebook.

The Uprising Campaign gang roster is made up of a number of elements, as shown
opposite: the gang’s name and Allegiance (1) and House (2), its Gang Rating (3),
Reputation (4) and Meat (5), the Territories it holds (6) and its Stash (7), containing
unspent credits, surplus equipment (both weapons and Wargear), and so on. It also
has a line for each fighter in the gang, with space for their names (8), fighter type (9),
Cost (10), Experience earned (11), the number of Advancements and/or Mutations
gained (12), and whether they are currently In Recovery (13),
are Starving (14) or have suffered any injuries or been Captured (15).

Note that although the number of rows is limited, there is no upper limit on the
number of fighters a gang can contain. Should a gang be lucky enough to have more
fighters than can be fitted onto one gang roster, simply use a second gang roster for
extra space.

### Choosing Sides

When a hive collapses into anarchy, gangs swiftly
find themselves either defending the status quo, or
putting a torch to everything in sight. In the Uprising
Campaign, two opposed forces are battling for the
fate of the hive – the instruments of Lord Helmawr’s
authority representing the agents of Order, and those
aligned with the rebellion representing the servants of
Chaos in all its many forms. When creating a gang for
an Uprising Campaign, each player must decide if they
represent Order, Chaos or wish to begin the campaign
Unaligned. Each comes with its own benefits as
detailed below, though be warned, no gang can stand
on the sidelines forever and eventually Unaligned
players will need to choose between one side or
the other.

Some gangs can only be part of either Order or
Chaos, their nature deciding their fate when they are
created, and players fielding these gangs must join the
faction indicated:

- Corpse Grinder Cult and Chaos Helot Cult gangs are
  always part of the Chaos side.
- Palanite Enforcer gangs and Genestealer Cults\*
  are always part of the Order side.
- All other gangs may choose to be either Order, Chaos
  or Unaligned at the start of the campaign.

_\*Players should note that Genestealer Cults have their own insidious agendas and often hide in plain sight, masquerading as loyal Imperial subjects. The machinations of Chaos are anathema to such alien plans, and so Genestealer Cults will readily take up arms to help quell such an uprising, strengthening their own power in doing so…_

#### Benefits Of Order

Gangs aligned with the agencies of Order gain the
following benefits:

- **Lord Helmawr’s Coffers:** The gang may re-roll any
  dice when determining the amount of credits gained
  as part of a scenario.
- **Pax Imperium:** If the gang is the defender in a
  battle, they may add one more fighter of their choice
  to their crew than normally allowed by the scenario.

#### Benefits Of Unaligned

Gangs who have yet to choose their Allegiance gain the
following benefits:

- **Hard as Nails:** When the gang gains Reputation
  as part of a scenario, it gains 1 more Reputation
  than normal.
- **No Gods or Masters:** If the gang’s Leader
  participated in a battle and did not go Out of Action,
  they gain an extra D3 Experience points in addition
  to any other Experience gains.

#### Benefits Of Chaos

Gangs aligned with the servants of Chaos gain the
following benefits:

- **Bloody Harvest:** When the gang gains Meat as part
  of a scenario, it gains one more portion of Meat
  than normal.
- **Tear it all Down:** If the gang is the attacker in a
  battle, they may add one more fighter of their choice
  to their crew than normally allowed by the scenario.

### Balancing Order And Chaos

The Uprising Campaign has been designed to work with any mix of Chaos, Order or Unaligned gangs, and it is as possible to find the agents of Order fighting amongst themselves to control the hive as it is for the servants of Chaos to squabble over its ruins. However, as a guideline, an Uprising Campaign should include at least one Chaos aligned gang and one Order aligned gang at the start, with any number of Unaligned gangs. This allows for sides to form naturally over the course of the campaign, with gangs either choosing to fight to save their hive or succumb to the madness of Chaos.

Other alternatives include starting the campaign with all gangs but one aligned with either Order or Chaos – representing a lone beacon of light struggling to hold back the night, or the seeds of corruption planted in the heart of the hive’s hierarchy.

:::

#### Changing Sides

By default, gangs cannot switch between Order and
Chaos during the course of the campaign, as this
keeps things simple and ensures that there will
always be at least one gang fighting for either side of
the rebellion. If the Arbitrator chooses, gangs can be
allowed to change sides if certain conditions are met
– representing the corrupting influence of the Ruinous
Powers or the ruthless cunning of Lord Helmawr’s
servants in pitting enemies against one another. Order
gangs will fall to Chaos if at least three of their fighters
become Chaos Spawn as a result of Festering Injuries
(see page 85). Chaos gangs will find themselves
unwittingly aiding the forces of Order if at least three
of their fighters are Captured, then returned to them
willingly by their Captors (i.e., not recovered by the gang
as part of the Public Execution scenario). Once a gang
has changed sides it may not change back – both the
Imperial House and the Dark Gods have little sympathy
for traitors to their cause.

### Determine Territories

At the start of the Uprising Campaign, each player’s
gang begins in control of three Territories. One
of these is determined by the type of gang they
are playing as follows. This represents the gang’s
home base or hideout and can never be lost, even
if it is the only Territory the gang controls. The two
remaining Territories are generated randomly (see
page 88). There are no uncontrolled Territories in an
Uprising Campaign.

### Issuing and Accepting Challenges

During an Uprising Campaign, battles are fought on a
challenge basis:

- During each cycle, each player may issue one
  challenge to another gang to do battle:
  - In the first cycle, challenges are made in a random order.
  - In later cycles, they are made in ascending order
    of Gang Rating, starting with the gang with the
    lowest Gang Rating. If two gangs have the same
    Gang Rating, the winner of a roll-off makes their
    challenge first.
  - No Territories are declared as the stake of
    the battle.
- If one of a gang’s fighters has been captured by
  another gang, rather than rolling on the Scenario
  table, a gang that has had one of its fighters
  captured by another gang may issue a challenge to
  that gang to play the Public Execution scenario (see
  page 108). If the challenge is declined, then the
  captured fighter is automatically returned.
- When a gang is challenged, they may accept or
  decline. If the challenge is accepted, a battle is
  fought. If the challenge is declined, the challenging
  gang automatically takes control of a random
  Territory controlled by the challenged gang.
- If a gang receives two or more challenges within a
  single cycle, they may decline the second and any
  subsequent challenges without penalty.
- If a player has played all outstanding battles
  (including their issued challenge and any challenges
  accepted) and there is still time left in the cycle,
  they may issue another challenge.

If, at the end of the battle, the winning gang inflicted
three times as many Out of Action results on their
opponent as they themselves suffered (not counting
models that left the battlefield voluntarily or fled
because of a failed Bottle check), then they take
control of one of their opponent’s Territories chosen at
random. Otherwise, no Territory changes control.

#### Scenario Selection Table

Once players have determined who their gangs are
fighting, they should roll on the Uprising Scenarios
table below to determine which scenario they will
play. In some cases, there will be a choice as to which
scenario is played. In these cases, the player whose
gang is fighting for the side with Ascendancy
(see page 80) may choose.
