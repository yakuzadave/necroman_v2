# Intrigues

Intrigues are a special form of sub-plot a player can
choose to fulfil during any game played in a Law
and Misrule Campaign. Each Intrigue represents
an opportunity; a tempting offer or gambit that will
give the gang great reward if they claim it. Intrigues
fall into two categories: Law or Misrule, but can be
claimed by any gang regardless of alignment. If a
gang claims an Intrigue from a category that does
not match their alignment, there is a risk that word
of their actions will get out, harming their reputation
and credibility, and perhaps forcing the gang to
change alignment.

:::note Designer’s Note – Sub-Plots

As Intrigues are a variant of sub-plots, it is
recommended that other sub-plots are not used
in a Law and Misrule Campaign as they add
another layer of possibilities to games which, in
addition to Intrigues, can make those games a
bit overburdened with rules.

:::

## Drawing Intrigues

Both players draw three Intrigue cards at the start
of each battle, during step 4 of the pre-battle
sequence. After reading their cards, both players
should place them face-down beside the battlefield.

## Claiming Intrigues

An Intrigue can be claimed by the player that drew
it once the criteria listed have been met. A player
can claim an Intrigue at any point during the battle
simply by picking the Intrigue card up and saying
that they are claiming it. Once an Intrigue has been
claimed, it cannot be unclaimed.

## Betraying Your Alignment

If a gang claims an Intrigue froma category that
does not match their alignment, it will have to make an [Alignment check](/docs/campaigns/law-and-misrule-campaign/#alignment-checks) during step 2 of the post-battle sequence. If this test if
failed, the gang’s alignment will immediately change.

:::note Making An Intrigue Deck

The Intrigues & Rackets Card Pack contains cards for each Intrigue used in the Law and Misrule Campaign. These cards feature all of
the Intrigues’ special rules. If you do not have the Intrigues & Rackets Card Pack, you can use half a deck of playing cards to determine the Intrigues before a battle. Remove all Hearts,
Clubs and Jokers, leaving just Diamonds and Spades. Each card in these remaining suits corresponds to an Intrigue, as indicated in the Intrigue descriptions that follow.
