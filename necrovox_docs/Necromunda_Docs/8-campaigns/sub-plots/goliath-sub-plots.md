# Goliath Sub-plots

House Goliath has its own way of doing things, which usually includes raw displays
of strength and dishing out excessive amounts of violence. Unlike other Clan
Houses, they care little for the nuances of inter-clan politics, or the whims of the
Great Houses. A Goliath gang that wins its wars through subterfuge is no Goliath
gang at all, and the demands of the Clan House reflect these savage beliefs. To this
end, House Goliath sub-plots are not so much cunning schemes or uphiver plans
as they are chances for Goliath gangs to prove just how tough they really are.

If players are using sub-plots in their games (see the Necromunda Rulebook) then
a Goliath player may choose to use the Goliath Sub-plots table rather than any of
the ones in the rulebook or elsewhere. Unlike the sub-plots in the rulebook, Goliath
sub-plots do not use suits (i.e., any Ace drawn will represent the King Hit sub-plot
regardless of its suit).

|  Ace  | **King Hit**<br /> Reveal this card when one of your fighters takes an enemy fighter Out of Action with an unarmed attack (taking an enemy Out of Action with a Coup de Grace action does not count). The fighter immediately earns D3+1 XP. If they were Engaged with two or more enemies when this card was revealed, they earn D6+1 XP instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|   2   | **Raw Aggression**<br /> Reveal this card at the end of the game, provided there is still at least one model from your gang on the battlefield. If all of your remaining fighters are in your opponent’s deployment area, your gang gains D3 Reputation. Additionally, if the battle ended without any of your fighters going Out of Action, earn 2D3 Reputation instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|   3   | **Stimmer Rampage**<br /> Reveal this card after both crews have deployed but before the first round begins. Every fighter in your crew begins the game under the effects of a stimm-slug stash Unlike a normal stimm-slug stash these effects last until the end of the battle, or when the fighter suffers a Serious Injury. However, the rigours of such high doses of stimms mean that when rolling to see if a fighter is overcome by the effects of the chems, they must roll a number of D6 equal to the current round, with any results of 1 forcing them to suffer an Injury dice. If you win the scenario, your gang earns D6 Reputation, in addition to any scenario rewards. If you lose, your gang’s Reputation is decreased by D3 instead. |
|   4   | **Paid Overkill**<br /> If, at the start of any of your activations, two or more of your fighters are Engaged with the same enemy fighter, you may reveal this card. If at the end of the activation the enemy has been taken Out of Action, your gang gains D6x10 credits.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|   5   | **Pit Fight**<br /> The first time one of your fighters uses a weapon that does not have the Melee trait, discard this card. If, at the end of the battle, your fighters only used weapons with the Melee trait, reveal this card. Every fighter in your gang gains D3 XP, in addition to any other XP awarded for the scenario.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|   6   | **Show of Brawn**<br /> Reveal this card when a fighter in your crew uses a Brawn skill (i.e., Bull Charge, Bulging Biceps, Crushing Blow, Headbutt, Hurl, Iron Jaw), whether their action is successful or not. For passive skills, like Iron Jaw, this card can be revealed when the skill is triggered (i.e., when an opponent makes an unarmed attack against them). The fighter gains +1 XP. If the use of the skill took an enemy fighter Out of Action, they gain +D3 XP instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|   7   | **Excessive Force**<br /> If one of your fighters inflicts 5 or more points of damage to an enemy fighter in a single activation, reveal this card. Your gang gains + 1 Reputation. If the attack resulted in the enemy fighter going Out of Action, your gang gains +2 Reputation instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|   8   | **Personal Vendetta**<br /> Reveal this card should your gang’s Leader take your opponent’s Leader Out of Action with either a Shoot (Basic) action, or a Fight (Basic) action. Your gang immediately gains D3 randomly determined Gang Tactics.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|   9   | **Sky Stomp**<br /> Should one of your fighters fall on an enemy fighter (see the Necromunda Rulebook), reveal this card. If the enemy fighter was Seriously Injured or taken Out of Action, your fighter gains +1 XP. In addition, if your fighter survived the fall (i.e., they were not Seriously Injured or went Out of Action themselves), they gain an additional +1 XP.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|  10   | **Impressive Combo**<br /> Reveal this card if a Champion or Leader belonging to your gang wounds two or more enemy fighters during a single activation, using a weapon with the Melee trait. Your gang gains +1 Reputation. If three or more enemy fighters were wounded by the Champion or Leader using a weapon with the Melee trait, then your gang gains D3 Reputation instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Jack  | **Contempt for the Weak**<br /> Reveal this card during the Choose Crew step of the pre-battle sequence. You can reduce the size of your crew(as determined by the scenario) by up to half the number of models in your gang, to a minimum crew size of 1. If the scenario allows you to take your entire gang (i.e., Custom Selection without a number in brackets), then your entire gang is effectively your crew, and may be reduced as described above. Should your gang win the scenario, it receives D6x10 credits for each fighter that was removed from your starting crew.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Queen | **Back from the Dead**<br /> Reveal this card the second time one of your fighters recovers from being Seriously Injured (i.e., rolling a Flesh Wound when making a Recovery test and becoming Prone and Pinned). Your gang gains +D3 Reputation. If the recovered fighter then goes on to take an enemy fighter Out of Action before the end of the battle, your gang instead earns +2D3 Reputation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| King  | **Naked Brutality**<br /> Reveal this card during the Choose Crew step of the pre-battle sequence. Choose one of the fighters in your crew and tuck this card under their Fighter card or otherwise note that they are the subject of this sub-plot. For the duration of this battle the chosen fighter counts as having no weapons, armour or Wargear, regardless of what appears on their model. If the fighter manages to inflict a Serious Injury, or an Out of Action result, on an enemy fighter, and if they are still on the battlefield at the end of the game then they earn 6 XP.                                                                                                                                                             |
