# Sub-plots

The fortunes of a House are often tied invisibly to the rise and fall of its strongest allied gangs - each gang leader is akin to a general in the House's armies, and each victory earns the House masters much kudos from their peers as well as political capital to further their schemes. For the most part, the gangs are given autonomy to further the interests of the House, largely by the simple act of fighting in its name, and sent to places where they can do the most good (or harm to the House's foes). Sometimes, however, the nobles of a house will choose to take a more direct hand in matters - one which gang leaders ignore at their peril.

House sub-plots represent the more direct meddling of the House in the activities of a gang. These side missions can be included in any of the scenarios, and allow a gang to earn some extra Reputation, Credits, Experience or gain additional Tactics cards should they complete them. Players should decide during the pre-battle sequence if they want to use House Sub-plots, with both players needing to agree to include them. If they do, they will need a deck of playing cards. Each player shuffles the deck and draws a card without letting their opponent see it - starting with the player with the lower Gang Rating (if both players have the same rating, roll off).

They then should consult the tables in this section to see what kind of Sub-plot their gang has been given. If a Joker card is drawn, the player should immediately show it to their opponenet and draw two new cards (without showing them to their opponent) giving them two Sub-plots for the game. If ones of these cards is also a Joker card, then repeat the process, giving the player a total of three Sub-plots. Each Sub-plot contains details on when it is revealed, how to complete it, and the rewards for doing so. Unless otherwise noted, once a card has been revealed, and its effects have been resolved, it is discarded.

### Secret and Revealed

Sub-plots are kept secret until completed or revealed. Unless the Sub-plot details when it is revealed, it will normally be revealed once it affects the battle with some effect or action.

### Voluntary Usage

Each Sub-plot has some some criteria that must be achieved to receive the reward. All Sub-plots are voluntary, and if a gang deems the gain is not worth the cost, it can be kept dormant without any effect.

### Alignments

If the Sub-plot specifies an alignment, it is safe to use for gangs with a matching alignment. If a gang from the opposite alignment claims it, an alignment test must be made after the battle, with a number of D6s rolled as specified.

### Voluntary to Claim

A gang can always choose whether to claim a Sub-plot or not.

### Alliances

Gangs with an Alliance can't use Sub-plots.

:::danger House Rule (Necrodamus)
Instead of declaring any Sub-plot specific actions or effects, a gang can declare using a secret action or effect. This way, the opponent gang knows that something is going on, but not exactly what. In addition, the opponent gang can demand that a Sub-plot is revealed if they have a fighter within 6” and LOS to a location where a secret action or effect takes place.

## Generic Sub-plots

The generic Sub-plots are organised by suit, with each suit representing a different theme.

### Industrial Sabotage (Spades ♠)

_Gangs are often ordered to attack the infrastructure of rival Houses, there being no swifter way to force a House out of favour than to bring down their production output._

|  Card   | Sub-plot                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

|  Ace ♠  | **Spudwrenching**<br />Attacks against machinery are a quick way for a House to hurt rivals, and many of the ancient technologies of Necromunda are completely irreplaceable. A fighter in your opponent’s deployment zone may make the Spudwrenching (Double) action – reveal this card the first time one of your fighters makes this action. Each time this action is successfully made, make a note. If one of your fighters can complete three Spudwrenching actions in a row, they have destroyed something vital to the opposing House and your gang gains D3+1 Reputation. |
|   2 ♠   | **Spreading Unrest**<br />The House wants to start an uprising among their enemy’s workers and has tasked the gang with spreading seditious propaganda. A fighter in your opponent’s deployment zone may make the Graffiti (Double) action–reveal this card the first time one of your fighters makes this action. If this is successful, make a note. At the end of the game, if your gang has completed at least three Graffiti actions, then it gains D3 Reputation.                                                                                                            |
|   3 ♠   | **Superior Tools**<br />The House has given the gang an experimental weapon for their next battle, eager to see its effects. At the start of the game, reveal this card and randomly choose one of the fighters in your crew – for this game increase the Strength and Damage characteristic of one of their weapons by 1. If your gang wins the game, then the test was a success and the gang gains D3 Reputation.                                                                                                                                                               |
|   4 ♠   | **Scorched Earth**<br />If the House can’t have it, then no one can. Reveal this card at the start of the game. If this is a Zone Mortalis game, destroy at least three doors. If this is a Sector Mechanicus game, choose a piece of terrain within 6" of the centre of the table and wreck it – count the terrain as having T8 and W8. This terrain is automatically hit by attacks, due to its large size. Wrecked terrain remains on the table but is considered to have been damaged in some significant way. If your gang is successful, they gain D3 Reputation.            |
|   5 ♠   | **Show Of Force**<br />Sometimes winning is not enough, and to really drive home the dominance of a House, its enemies need to be utterly crushed. At the end of the game, if there are at least five enemy fighters Out of Action (not counting those that have fled the battlefield), reveal this card to gain D3+1 Reputation for your gang.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|   6 ♠   | **The Stitch Up**<br />Houses routinely frame enemy fighters for crimes in order to bring their rivals into disrepute. Reveal this card at the start of the game and randomly choose a fighter from your opponent’s crew. When one of your fighters is in base contact with the chosen fighter, they may make the Plant Evidence (Basic) action. If successful, your gang gains D3 Reputation. If, at the end of the game, the enemy fighter has not been Seriously Injured or taken Out of Action, your gang gains an additional D3 Reputation.                                   |
|   7 ♠   | **Dangerous Ground**<br />A particular patch of turf is vital to your House and must be held at all costs. Reveal this card at the start of the game and choose a piece of terrain or game tile anywhere at least 12" from your deployment zone. If, at the end of the game, there are no enemy fighters within 6" of the piece of terrain or on the chosen game tile, your gang gains D3 Reputation.                                                                                                                                                                              |
|   8 ♠   | **Right Of Way**<br />The House needs a clear passage to move its goods through an area and wants the gang to make a path. Reveal this card at the end of the game. If at least four of your fighters are in your enemy’s deployment zone, your gang gains D6 Reputation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|   9 ♠   | **Decapitating Strike**<br />Taking out a gang’s leadership is a sure way to put a spudwrench in their plans. Reveal this card when one of your fighters takes an enemy Leader or Champion Out of Action. At the end of the game if your opponent has no Leader or Champion models on the board, your gang gains D6 Reputation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|  10 ♠   | **Meat For The Machine**<br />The meat harvesters are always offering good sums for fresh meat, and often gather on the levels below a gang fight to gather up the leftovers. If the actions of one of your fighters knocks an enemy down a pitfall, or causes them to fall from a height and be taken Out of Action, reveal this card and gain D3 Reputation. If, at the end of the game, three or more enemies have been knocked down pitfalls or are taken Out of Action by falls, your gang gains an additional D3 Reputation.                                                 |
| Jack ♠  | **Contemptuous Takedown**<br />A good yarn about a contemptuous takedown is useful propaganda for the House. Reveal this cardif one of your fighters takes an enemy fighter Out of Action with an unarmed attack, and gain D3 Reputation for your gang. If the enemy fighter was a Leader or a Champion, gain D6 Reputation instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Queen ♠ | **Juve Cull**<br />Separating the spores from the scum is good for all of the Houses, plus, it keeps the locals in line. Reveal this card if your gang has taken all of the opposing player’s Juves Out of Action. If your opponent has no Juves in their crew, reveal it if you take Out of Action the three Gangers with the lowest Credits value. Completing this Sub-plot earns your gang D6 Reputation.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| King ♠  | **Swift Victory**<br />A quick victory always impresses the House masters. Reveal this card at the end of the game if you won the scenario within 10 rounds or less and gain D6 Reputation for your gang. If you won the scenario in 5 rounds or fewer, your gang gains 2D6 Reputation instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

### Noble Whims (Hearts ♥)

_Sometimes the personal whims of house nobles play themselves out through gang warfare and strange requests will come down from on-high._

|                    Card                     | Sub-plot                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

|  Ace <span style={{color: 'red'}}>♥</span>  | **Extreme Displeasure**<br />For reasons known only to the noble, one of the enemy fighters has earned their ire. Reveal this card at the start of the game, after your opponent has selected their crew but before deploying any fighters. Your opponent should shuffle their crew deck and randomly select a fighter. If, at the end of the game, the selected fighter has been taken Out of Action, add D6x10 credits to the gang’s Stash. If the fighter was taken Out of Action with a Melee weapon, or with the Coup de Grace action, then add 2D6x10 credits instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|   2 <span style={{color: 'red'}}>♥</span>   | **Noble Nephew**<br />News has arrived that one of the gang’s fighters is a distant relation to someone powerful and must be protected. Reveal this card at the start of the game and randomly choose one of your Juves, or if your gang does not contain any Juves, randomly select a Ganger instead. If, at the end of the game, the chosen fighter has not suffered any wounds, add 10 credits to the gang’s Stash. If they suffered no wounds, but managed to inflict at least one wound on an enemy, add D6x10 credits instead. After the game, it turns out that they were not related at all and that it was a clerical error.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|   3 <span style={{color: 'red'}}>♥</span>   | **Lost Heirloom**<br />Some vitally important object has been lost by the noble and they want the gang to recover it for them – the only problem is the noble is not entirely sure where it is. If you are playing a Zone Mortalis game then the heirloom is in a ductway, if you are playing Sector Mechanicus then it is on one of the upper levels of a piece of terrain – any scenery feature roughly 12" or less across with a raised area counts. At any point during the game any of your fighters may make the Search (Double) action if they are within 3" of a ductway or on the upper levels of a piece of terrain – reveal this card the first time one of your fighters makes this action. When they do this, roll a D6. Ona 5+, or if this is the last unsearched ductway or terrain piece, they find the heirloom and gain 2D6x10 credits. Otherwise it is not in this ductway or terrain piece. |
|   4 <span style={{color: 'red'}}>♥</span>   | **A Warning**<br />The gang has a message to deliver and the noble wants to make sure the enemy Leader knows just who it is from. During this game, if one of your fighters makes a successful melee attack against the enemy Leader, you can reveal this card and choose not to roll to wound for any hits scored, ending the attack without effect, and adding D6x10 credits to the gang’s Stash. If the fighter that made the attack was your Leader, add 2D6x10 credits instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|   5 <span style={{color: 'red'}}>♥</span>   | **Cruel And Unusual**<br />The noble likes to hear the piteous screams of their enemies, and has even sent the gang a vox recording device for just that purpose! If, at the end of the game, the actions of your fighters caused at least two enemy fighters to become Broken, reveal this card and add D3x10 credits to the gang’s Stash. If three or more enemy fighters were Broken, add D6x10 credits instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|   6 <span style={{color: 'red'}}>♥</span>   | **Spyrer Style**<br />Appearance is everything for some nobles, and the gang has been told that they must wear the colours of a particular House luminary in their coming battle. Reveal this card at the start of the game. For this battle, your gang has been forced to wear garishly bright coats, huge floppy hats, or some invisible but no less ridiculous ostentation like distilled Phyrr Cat scent. Your opponent reduces the penalty to hit your fighters by 1 (i.e., full cover would provide -1 to hit and partial cover would give no benefit). If your gang wins the game, add 2D6x10 credits to the gang’s Stash. If they win without any fighters going Out of Action, add 3D6x10 credits instead.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|   7 <span style={{color: 'red'}}>♥</span>   | **Recovery Job**<br />The enemy gang owes someone the noble knows money, and the noble wants the gang to collect. When one of your fighters is in base contact with any enemy fighter, they may make the Shakedown (Basic) action – reveal this card the first time one of your fighters makes this action to gain D3x10 credits. Shakedown actions taken against Champions and Leaders yield D6x10 credits instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|   8 <span style={{color: 'red'}}>♥</span>   | **Death From Above**<br />The noble has a dark sense of humour and wants the gang to deliver his retribution ‘from on high’. If you take an enemy fighter Out of Action by having another fighter (either friendly or enemy) fall on them, reveal this card to gain 2D6x10 credits. If the enemy fighter was a Leader or Champion, gain 3D6x10 credits instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|   9 <span style={{color: 'red'}}>♥</span>   | **A Suitable Spectacle**<br />The more blood the better is often the cry of the House masters. If an attack made by one of your fighters rolls 3 or more Injury dice at once, and at least one of the dice comes up as Out of Action, reveal this card and gain D6x10 credits.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|  10 <span style={{color: 'red'}}>♥</span>   | **No Witnesses**<br />Sometimes a quiet kill is just what is required to advance the noble’s plans. Reveal this card when you take an enemy fighter Out of Action, and no enemy models have line of sight to either the enemy fighter, or the fighter that took them out, to gain D3x10 credits. If your fighter took out the model with a melee weapon, your gang gains D6x10 credits instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Jack <span style={{color: 'red'}}>♥</span>  | **Make Some Noise**<br />Some nobles want to set the hive on fire, just to watch it burn! Reveal this card at the end of any round when you have fired five or more weapons with the Blast, Rapid Fire or Blaze Trait, without causing any wounds, to gain 2D6x10 credits.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Queen <span style={{color: 'red'}}>♥</span> | **Shadowing**<br />A noble wants the gang to keep an eye on an enemy fighter, to see how they fight and just what they are up to. Reveal this card at the start of the game and randomly choose a fighter from your opponent’s crew. Any fighter within 12" of the chosen fighter may make the Shadow (Double) action. A Shadowing fighter makes no other action this turn, but if its target moves it is also moved to remain within 12" of them – unlesss topped by impassable terrain or enemy models. If, at the end of the game, you have a fighter shadowing the target your gang gains D6 Reputation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| King <span style={{color: 'red'}}>♥</span>  | **Work For The Docs**<br />The noble has bought a share in a local sawbones holding and wants the gang to drum up business. Reveal this card at the end of the game. For every fighter, friend or foe, that went Out of Action but did not die (a 66 result on the Lasting Injury table), your gang gains D3x10 credits. Any fighters who rolled a Trip to the Docs provide D6x10 credits instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

### Unforgiving Underhive (Clubs ♣)

_Knock-on effects from the great games played by the houses (and constant warfare between gangs) can change the fortunes of a gang even before the first round is fired._

|  Ace ♣  | **Voxfailure**<br />Gangers must often make do with second rate equipment – whatever the House deigns to give them or what they can scrounge from underhive traders. Reveal this card at the start of the game. For the duration of the scenario, your Leader’s Leading by Example range is reduced to 6" and any of your fighters out of line of sight of any friendly models add 1 to their Leadership and Cool characteristics to a maximum of 12+. If your gang wins the game, every fighter that took part gains D3 Experience points in addition to any Experience rewards for the scenario.                                                            |
|   2 ♣   | **Failed Assassination**<br />There are few rules when it comes to gang warfare, and some fighters are not above evening the odds before the battle has begun. Reveal this card at the start of the game and randomly select one of the fighters from your crew. For the duration of the game, the fighter must reduce their Move, WS, BS and S by 1. If the fighter survives the game without being Seriously Injured or taken Out of Action, they gain D6 Experience points in addition to any Experience rewards for the scenario.                                                                                                                         |
|   3 ♣   | **Wandering Watchmen**<br /> One of the gang’s patrols is in the right place at the right time and has heard the sounds of battle. You may reveal this card at the start of any round. Randomly select D3 fighters that are not part of your crew and set them up in your deployment area. These fighters are now part of your crew for this scenario. If you lose the scenario, none of your fighters will gain any Experience for the game.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|   4 ♣   | **Loaded For Sump Spider**<br />Extra ammo rations have reached the gang and every fighter has pockets full of shells, bullets and power packs. Reveal this card at the start of the game. For the duration of the scenario, every fighter in your crew may re-roll failed ammo tests. However, all hits on your fighters from ranged weapons deal an extra point of Damage. Every fighter in your crew that survives the game without being taken Out of Action gains D3 experience points in addition to any experience rewards for the scenario.                                                                                                           |
|   5 ♣   | **Out Of Favour**<br />The gang’s House has fallen out of favour with the Imperial House and there is much dissention among the nobles. Lack of strong leadership and news of House gangs getting scragged has everyone on edge. Reveal this card at the start of the game. For the duration of the game, add 2 to the Cool characteristics of all of your fighters, to a maximum of 12+. If your gang wins the game, each fighter gains an additional D3 Experience points in addition to any noted in the scenario. If you win without any fighters going Out of Action, each fighter gains D6 extra Experience points instead.                             |
|   6 ♣   | **House Spies**<br />Your gang’s plans have fallen into enemy hands. Reveal this card before either gang has deployed. You must set up before your opponent regardless of the normal rules for the scenario, and your opponent automatically wins the roll for Priority in the first turn. There after, your opponent gains a +1 on all rolls to determine who has Priority. Every fighter in your crew that survives the game without being taken Out of Action gains D3 Experience points in addition to any Experience rewards for the scenario.                                                                                                           |
|   7 ♣   | **Doppelganger**<br />One of your Gangers is not what they seem. Reveal this card the first time one of your Gangers (not Juves, Leader or Champions) is taken Out of Action. Instead of removing the model, leave them on the board – any effects, such as being on fire or having run out of ammo, are discarded and they are restored to their starting wounds. They now count as part of the opponent’s gang for the remainder of the scenario. If one of your fighters manages to take the imposter Out of Action, they gain D6 Experience points. No Lasting Injury roll is made for the imposter fighter as they were never really part of the battle. |
|   8 ♣   | **A Bit Of Payback**<br />A simmering anger has taken over your gang – maybe one too many stories of comrades getting scragged or their rivals swanning about in their turf has got your fighters riled up. Reveal this card the first time one of your fighters successfully completes a Coup de Grace action to give that fighter an Experience point in addition to any Experience for taking an enemy Out of Action. For the remainder of the game, Coup de Grace actions taken by your fighters will award them an additional Experience point, provided that they have not already gained any Experience as a result of this card.                      |
|   9 ♣   | **Bad Day**<br />Every gang boss has their off days; it’s just that sometimes it gets people killed. Reveal this card the first time either your Leader or one of your Champions activates – for the duration of the game, that Leader or Champion cannot make group activations. If the chosen fighter survives the game without being taken Out of Action, they gain D3 Experience points if they are a Champion, or D6 Experience points if they are a Leader.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|  10 ♣   | **Act Of Defiance**<br />If you’re going down, you might as well take as many with you as you can. Reveal this card if one of your fighters moves into base contact with two or more models to gain D3 Experience points for that fighter. If the fighter takes out all enemies in base contact in the same activation that this card is revealed, that fighter gains an additional D3 Experience points.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Jack ♣  | **Grim Resolve**<br />Only the hard survive in Necromunda. Reveal this card when one of your fighters rallies from being Broken. That fighter gains one Experience point. For the remainder of the battle, every time one of your fighters rallies from being Broken, they will gain an Experience point unless they have already gained Experience as a result of this card.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Queen ♣ | **Hazard Pay**<br />Overcoming the hazards of the underhive is often a challenge in itself. Reveal this card the first time one of your fighters successfully leaps over the pitfall, survives a fall that inflicts Damage or interacts with a hazard that could damage them and survives. That fighter gains one Experience point. For the remainder of the battle, every time one of your fighters survives a hazard in these ways they gain one experience point, unless they have already gained Experience as a result of this card.                                                                                                                     |
| King ♣  | **Chemical Solutions**<br />The gang has been hitting the chems a bit hard, making them less likely to feel injuries but also more reckless! Reveal this card the first time one of your fighters suffers a Flesh Wound. For the duration of the game, your fighters ignore the effects of Flesh Wounds. However, when rolling on the Lasting Injuries table, they must roll twice and accept the higher result. At the end of the game, every fighter in the crew – that is still alive – gains an additional D3 Experience points.                                                                                                                          |

### Dark Influences (Diamonds ♦)

_The Clan Houses are not the only ones that can conscript an underhive gang for their own agendas, and sometimes gang bosses will serve different masters, often without realising. The rewards of these unseen patrons may appear capricious or random, but in the fires of battle are rarely unwelcome._

|  Ace <span style={{color: 'red'}}>♦</span>  | **Outlaw Vendetta**<br />Guilders aren’t the only ones to put out bounties. Reveal this card at the end of any round in which four or more enemy fighters suffer a Serious Injury or are taken Out of Action by your gang. If these conditions are met, draw a random Gang Tactics card.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|   2 <span style={{color: 'red'}}>♦</span>   | **Strangers In The Hive**<br />Eyes watch from the darkness, waiting for your gang to lure some prey into their grasp. Reveal this card when your gang takes an enemy fighter Out of Action with a melee attack who is out of line of sight and more than 12" from any models in their own gang. If these conditions are met, draw a random Gang Tactics card.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|   3 <span style={{color: 'red'}}>♦</span>   | **Deathly Silence**<br />In the aftermath of a massacre, dark forces gather. Reveal this card if at least half of your opponent’s crew is either Seriously Injured, Out of Action, or held off the table as Reinforcements. If these conditions are met, draw a random Gang Tactics card.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|   4 <span style={{color: 'red'}}>♦</span>   | **Mind Slavers**<br />A weak mind is fertile ground for predatory psykers. Reveal this card when an enemy fighter fails a Willpower test with a result of 10+. If these conditions are met, draw a random Gang Tactics card.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|   5 <span style={{color: 'red'}}>♦</span>   | **Scrap Code**<br />A mysterious stranger has hired the gang to plant a code in the local cogitator network. Reveal this card at the start of the game and choose three pieces of terrain and/or door consoles at least 6" from your deployment area and at least 8" from each other. Fighters may make the Hacking (Double) action while within 1" of these points. If they do, make an Intelligence test for them – if successful, they have planted the code. If your gang can hack all three locations, draw a random Gang Tactics card.                                                                                                                                              |
|   6 <span style={{color: 'red'}}>♦</span>   | **Cold Trade**<br />An enemy fighter is unwittingly carrying an off-world object of great interest to the Guilders. Reveal this card the first time one of your fighters sends an enemy fighter Out of Action either in melee or as part of a Coup de Grace action – then roll a D6, adding 1 to the result for each enemy fighter previously sent Out of Action in melee or with a Coup de Grace action. If the result is 6+, your gang has found the object and you may draw a random Gang Tactics card.                                                                                                                                                                                |
|   7 <span style={{color: 'red'}}>♦</span>   | **Suppression Order**<br />Keeping an enemy gang kissing the ground is a good way of letting them know their place. Reveal this card at the end of any round in which every enemy fighter on the board is Prone. If these conditions are met, draw one random Gang Tactics card.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|   8 <span style={{color: 'red'}}>♦</span>   | **Official Secrets**<br />Enforcers want some evidence on a gang Leader. When one of your fighters activates within 6" of your opponent’s Leader, they may make the Pict Capture (Double) action. If a model that has taken this action begins their activation in your deployment area, you can remove them from the game (they do not count as going Out of Action) and draw a random Gang Tactics card.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|   9 <span style={{color: 'red'}}>♦</span>   | **A Little Surprise**<br />The gang has been given an opportunity to help with some urban renewal. Reveal this card at the start of the game and randomly select one of your crew to carry the bomb. The bomb carrier can make the Plant Bomb (Double) action. If the bomb carrier completes this action three times within 6" of the centre of the board, the bomb has been planted and you can draw a random Gang Tactics card. Should the bomb carrier go Out of Action before planting the bomb, work out the effects of a frag trap as if it had gone off centred on the bomb carrier’s position.                                                                                    |
|  10 <span style={{color: 'red'}}>♦</span>   | **The Payoff**<br />Credits often work as well as bullets to change someone’s mind. For this battle, your fighters can make the Bribe (Basic) action if they are in base contact with an enemy Ganger or Juve (though not the Leader or a Champion). Reveal this card the first time one of your fighters makes this action. When an enemy is bribed they must make a Willpower test. If successful, the action has no effect. Otherwise, the enemy gang receives D3x10 Credits and the bribed Ganger is removed from the board. They do not count as being taken Out of Action. As soon as an enemy has been successfully bribed, discard this card and draw a random Gang Tactics card. |
| Jack <span style={{color: 'red'}}>♦</span>  | **Guilder Packet**<br />Guilders like to use gangers as couriers in the underhive, because they don’t ask too many questions. Reveal this card at the start of the game and then randomly select one of your crew to be the courier. At the end of any round, if the courier is in the enemy’s deployment area, you can discard this card and remove the courier from the board (they do not count as going Out of Action) and draw a random Gang Tactics card.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Queen <span style={{color: 'red'}}>♦</span> | **Dark Offering**<br />Dark powers demand their due. Reveal this card at the start of the game and choose a point on the board at least 12" from your deployment area. If, at any time, there are three or more Seriously Injured fighters within 6" of the chosen point, discard this card and draw a random Gang Tactics card.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| King <span style={{color: 'red'}}>♦</span>  | **Bad Blood**<br />A strange infection has taken root in one of your fighters that compels them to spread their tainted blood. Reveal this card at the start of the game and randomly choose one of the fighters in your crew. If this fighter is taken Out of Action with a Melee weapon, draw a random Gang Tactics card. If the chosen fighter was a Champion or Leader, you may choose the Gang Tactics card instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
