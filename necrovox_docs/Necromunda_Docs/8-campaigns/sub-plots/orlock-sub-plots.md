# Orlock Sub-plots

House Orlock gangs enforce the will of their House and ensure its mining operations
continue as they have always done. Sometimes, this means straight up killing rivals
in as efficient a way as possible, other times it means making an example of them. Orlock gangs are also known for their hardiness, and many times a gang will do
something difficult or dangerous just to prove they can.

If players are using sub-plots in their battles (see the Necromunda Rulebook), then an
Orlock player may choose to use the Orlock Sub-plots table rather than any of the ones
in the rulebook. Unlike the sub-plots in the rulebook, Orlock sub-plots do not use suits
(i.e., any Ace drawn will represent the Hardman sub-plot regardless of its suit).

|  Ace  | **Hardman**<br /> Reveal this card when one of your fighters suffers two or more Flesh Wounds as part of a single damaging hit. If the fighter is still on the battlefield after working out the effects of the hit, your gang gains 1 Reputation. If the fighter is still Standing and Active, they gain D3 Reputation instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|   2   | **Sumptown Shakedown**<br /> Reveal this card when a friendly fighter performs a Coup De Grace (Simple) action. Instead of rolling on the Lasting Injury table for the opponent’s fighter, instead count the result as Out Cold, and add D3x10 credits to your gang’s Stash. For the remainder of the battle, whenever a friendly fighter performs the Coup De Grace (Simple) action, the fighter taken Out of Action automatically counts the result on the Lasting Injury table as 12-26 Out Cold, and D3x10 credits are added to your gang’s Stash.      |
|   3   | **Prospecting Mission**<br /> Reveal this card at the start of the battle, after both crews have deployed, but before rolling for Priority. Place three markers anywhere on the battlefield at least 12" from your deployment zone, and at least 8" from each other. During the battle, if one of your fighters is activated within 1" of one of these markers they may perform the Prospect (Basic) action, and remove the marker from the battlefield. At the end of the battle, add D6x10 credits to your gang’s Stash for each marker that was removed. |
|   4   | **Comeback King**<br /> Reveal this card at the start of any round if your gang has failed a Bottle test and your opponent has at least three times as many fighters on the battlefield as you do. If you subsequently go on to win the battle, your gang gains D3 Reputation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|   5   | **Call them Out**<br /> Reveal this card at the start of the battle, after both crews are set up but before rolling for Priority. Choose one of your fighters and one of your opponent’s fighters. If, during the course of the battle, your chosen fighter takes the chosen enemy fighter Out of Action from a distance of no more than 6", your gang gains D3 Reputation.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|   6   | **Take a Beating**<br /> Reveal this card if you win the battle with three or fewer friendly fighters Standing and Active. If you do, add D6x10 credits to your gang’s Stash. If you won the battle with only a single friendly fighter Standing and Active, gain 2D6x10 credits instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|   7   | **Race the Clock**<br /> If the battle ends before the start of round 7, and you are the winner of the scenario, reveal this card to gain 1 Reputation for your gang. If the battle ended before the start of round 3, and your gang was the winner of the scenario, gain D3 Reputation instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|   8   | **Outland Showdown**<br /> Reveal this card at the start of any activation if a friendly fighter and one of your opponent’s fighters are within 12" of each other, but also both more than 12" from any other fighters. If this is the case, and your fighter can Seriously Injure the enemy fighter, or take them Out of Action, your gang gains 1 Reputation.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|   9   | **Hostile Negotiations**<br /> When your opponent plays a gang tactic, if you have fewer fighters on the battlefield than your opponent does, reveal this card to immediately gain a single gang tactic. If they have three times as many, or more, fighters than you, gain two gang tactics instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|  10   | **Badzone Brotherhood**<br /> Reveal this card if one of your Champions or your Leader use the Leading by Example special rule to allow three or more friendly fighters to automatically pass their Cool checks. The Champion or Leader immediately gains D3 XP. If the Champion or Leader used the Leading by Example special rule to allow all remaining members of the crew to automatically pass their Cool checks, they will gain D6 XP instead.                                                                                                       |
| Jack  | **Mano-a-Mano**<br /> Reveal this card at the start of any activation while your Leader is Engaged with your opponent’s Leader. If your Leader takes your opponent’s Leader Out of Action with a Fight (Basic) action, add D6x10 credits to your gang’s Stash. If your Leader did so while Engaged with more than one enemy fighter, then add 2D6x10 credits to your Stash instead.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Queen | **Ash Bath**<br /> Reveal this card if three or more enemy fighters are subject to the Blaze condition at the same time to immediately gain a single gang tactic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| King  | **The Last Round**<br /> Reveal this card if one of your fighters successfully reloads one of their weapons and then takes an enemy fighter Out of Action with the same weapon as part of a single activation. That fighter gains D3 XP. If more than one enemy fighter was taken Out of Action during this single activation, the fighter gains D6 XP instead.                                                                                                                                                                                             |



A Necromunda enthusiast! I'm here to help you navigate the Orlock Sub-plots table.

This table provides unique sub-plot cards for House Orlock gangs in Necromunda. Unlike the standard sub-plot tables in the rulebook, these cards don't use suits (i.e., any Ace drawn will represent the Hardman sub-plot regardless of its suit).
