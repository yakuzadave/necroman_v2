# Road Sections & Trade Routes

A gang receives the benefits of a Road Section so long as it holds it. Benefits of Road Sections
are before each cycle.

Once the Road Section is lost (for example taken by another gang), the bonus is also lost.

There are 2 ways to take control of Road Sections:

- Winning a battle with a Road Section at stake.
- Road Section as exchange for Captives.
