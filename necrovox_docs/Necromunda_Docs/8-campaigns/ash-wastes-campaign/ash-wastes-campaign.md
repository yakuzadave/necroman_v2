# Ash Wastes Campaign

_Beyond the gives and their incessant industry, an endless war is being fought across the vast ash wastes. It is not a war of rival nations or opposing armies - though it can be just as bloody as one of these - rather, it is a war for the trade routes between the hives. Lord Helmawr cares not who controls these routes as long as the trade keeps flowing and Necromunda's staggering Imperial tithe is met. And so the Clan Houses vie for the lucrative contracts and control of remote road networks to fill their coffers with more wealth. In some places this descends into open warfare as convoys of merchant rigs fend off mounted marauders as they attempt to get their goods to where they need to be. For a gang that can claim dominion over even a tiny piece of this great trade network the rewards can be staggering, and well worth the price paid in blood, bullets and lives._

## How The Campaign Works

**Ash Wastes Campaign Summary**

The Necromunda Ash Wastes Campaign is a complete narrative campaign tht can be used alongside the Necromunda: Ash Wastes rules. It incorporates many of the existing Necromunda campaign rules, adding additional special rules to recreate just what it means to do battle in the wilderness between the hive cities and fight over vital trade routes that connect them.

In the Ash Wastes Campaign, players try to take control of road networks with their gang, claiming one stretch of the wastes at a time until they can connect one settlement, hive, or landmark to another and benefit from the trade that flows between them. Of course, this is no easy task. To claim a road a gang must fend off their rivals, survive the harsh elements of Necromunda and brave the changing seasons themselves - not to mention factions such as the Ash Wastes Nomads who simply want to destroy the dominion of the hivers. For those who succeed, however, the payoff is great indeed.



**Key Objectives:**

1. Claim road networks, stretching from one settlement/hive/landmark to another.
2. Survive and overcome challenges posed by:
	* Harsh environment (weather, terrain, etc.)
	* Rival gangs vying for control
	* Factions like the Ash Wastes Nomads seeking to disrupt trade
3. Establish a network of connected territories to benefit from trade and commerce.

What would you like to do first?

(Note: I've maintained the context of Necromunda, highlighting the key objectives and challenges in the Ash Wastes Campaign. Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any aspect or start simulating combat/territory creation.)

### Controlling Roads

Central to the Ash Wastes Campaign is the controlling of roads. At the start of the campaifgn all gangs will start with the goal of controlling as many road networks as they can to enrich both themselves and their faction. To complete this goal - and connect two important Ash Wastes locations - a gang must be in control of a special kind of Territory called Road Sections. If they can make a path from one location to another only using Road Sections they control then they can set up a Trade Route and reap even greater rewards! Players will start with some Road Sections determined randomly, but the majority must be won through defeating rival gangs on the battlefield.

## Outlaws & Raiders

All gangs are divided into 2 sides, affecting how income is earned from Trade Routes (tolls or disruption):

- Raiders.
- Traders.

Gangs are divided as follows:

- **Ash Waste Nomad:** Raiders.
- **Outlaw:** Raiders or Traders (choose when creating the gang).
- **Law-abiding:** Traders.

## Road Sections

Road Sections are connected with other Road Sections and/or locations. The region (Near/Deep/Wild Wastes) can affect battlefield surface conditions. The type (Sanctioned/Unsanctioned) indicates whether it is relatively safe or high-risk, high-reward.

## Trading Routes

Gain Trading Route bonuses (when collecting income at the start of any cycle) if controlling the required Road Sections to connect the specified locations.

See the [List of Roads Sections and Trade Routes](/docs/campaigns/ash-wastes-campaign/road-sections-and-trade-routes).

## Challenges

Challenges can only be declined without penalty by a gang that has already issued and received at least 1 challenge (this cycle).

## Starting Out

**Starting credits:** 1000  
**Additional Credits for Vehicles and Mounts:** 400  
**Keep unspent credits:** Yes

Players also begin with two randomly determined Road Sections (the Arbitrator can use the D66 column in the [Road Sections table](/docs/campaigns/ash-wastes-campaign/road-sections-and-trade-routes#road-sections) to allocate two to each player).

## Phases

### Phase 1: Season of Flame

At the begining of each cycle, gangs gain income from the Road Section and benefits from their Trade Routes (note that this is different form the normal post-battle sequence where you gain income from each Territory after each battle).

In the first two cycles, all battles are considered to take place during the Season of Flame. In the last cycle of the phase, players roll a D6 before each battle: on a 1-4 it's still the Season of Flame, on a 5-6 it takes place during the Changing Seasons.

Only unclaimed Road Sections may be claimed as rewards for gang battles.

### Phase 2: Downtime

Complete the following steps:

1. [Fighters Recover](/docs/campaigns/dominion-campaign/running-the-campaign#a-fighters-recover)
2. [Captives are Returned](/docs/campaigns/dominion-campaign/running-the-campaign#b-captives-are-returned)
3. [Experienced Juves are Promoted](/docs/campaigns/dominion-campaign/running-the-campaign#c-experienced-juves-and-prospects-are-promoted)
4. [Fresh Recruitment](/docs/campaigns/dominion-campaign/running-the-campaign#d-fresh-recruitment)

### Phase 3: Season of Ash

Gangs defend their Trade Routes against both their rivals and the elements, as well as destroy those set up by other gangs.

At the begining of each cycle, gangs gain income from the Road Section and benefits from their Trade Routes (note that this is different form the normal post-battle sequence where you gain income from each Territory after each battle).

In the first cycle, players roll a D6 before each battle: on a 1-4 the battle takes place in the Season of Ash, on a 5-6 it takes place during the Changing Seasons. In the last two cycles of the phase all battles are considered to take place during the Season of Ash.

## Ending the Campaign

After Phase 3, the campaign ends. There are a number of Triumphs (depending on campaign type). A gang may earn more than one, and in case of a tie, no one is awarded it.

| Triumphs                  | Criteria                                           |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Road Master               | Longest unbroken chain of connected Road Sections. |
| As Far as the Eye can See | Most Road Sections                                 |
| Road of Corpses           | Most kills                                         |
| Let it Burn               | Most enemy vehicles wrecked                        |
| Do You Know Who I Am!     | Highest Reputation                                 |

## Battlefield Environments

The following battlefield effects are in use:

- Battlefield Surface.
- Seasons.
- Regions.
- Roads.
- Visibility (X").

This can be determined in multiple ways for a battle:

- The campaign or scenario can specify certain Season and/or Region.
- Randomize by rolling on the tables.
- Gangs can agree to choose specific effects to use.

### Battlefield Surface

The ground level of the battlefield. Not including:

- Terrain.
- Elevated areas.
- Roads.

This will affect any fighter on the ground, unless on roads, elevated terrain or otherwise protected by terrain.

### Seasons

The season depends on the phase & cycle, otherwise randomize (D3):

1. Season of Flame.
1. Season of Ash.
1. Changing Seasons.

| Phase | Cycle | Season                                                                                        |

| 1     | 3     | Randomize (D3) before each battle:<br /> 1-2: Season of the Flame.<br /> 3: Changing Seasons. |
| 2     | 4     | -                                                                                             |
| 3     | 5     | Randomize (D3) before each battle:<br /> 1-2: Season of Ash.<br />3: Changing Seasons.        |
| 3     | 6     | Season of Ash.                                                                                |
| 3     | 7     | Season of Ash.                                                                                |



## Scenario Selection

:::note

It is up to the campaign to organise how they want to choose scenarios. Each gaming group is different and have different approaches. One option is to use the selection table suggested by the campaign designers below.

:::

When a challenge is issued, the scenario played is based upon the relevant region of the ash wastes the staked Road Section is in. Roll a D6 on the relevant table to determine which Scenario is used.

#### Near Wastes
