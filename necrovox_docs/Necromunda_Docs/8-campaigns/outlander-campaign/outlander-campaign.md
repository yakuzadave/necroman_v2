# Outlander Campaign

_For those in the upper reaches of the hive, the unfortunates of the underhive are all the same, and everywhere below the Nexus is an equally dismal ruin of despair and chaos. The truth, as always, is more complex. Beyond the settlements like Dust Falls, Two Tunnels or Sump City are the badzones. These are areas of underhive wilderness where travellers do well not to tarry. But they are not the most desperate places in the underhive by a good measure, for beyond the badzones, in those places where civilisation has truly abandoned Humanity, can be found the outlands._

## How The Campaign Works

The Necromunda: Outlander Campaign is a complete narrative campaign that can be used alongside the Necromunda rules. It incorporates many of the existing
Necromunda campaign rules, adding additional special rules to recreate just what it
means to live in the outlands and the lengths a gang must go to if it hopes to survive.

In the Outlander Campaign, players must try to create a functioning settlement from the ruins they find themselves in, attracting new settlers and green hivers, while at
the same time denying resources to their rivals. As the campaign progresses, the gangs lay their stake to these remote reaches of the underhive and the area reaches a tipping point â€“ either it will take its place among the power structures of the towns and settlements of the hive, or be wiped from existence beneath the boot of Lord Helmawr.

## Structures

Structures are the resources in an Outlander campaign. The settlement is a collection of Structures.

All Structures have a cost in Materials and some have additional requirements that must be met. Some Structures also provide Materials. There are 3 types:

- Power.
- Sustenance.
- Salvage.

Structures provide 1 or 2 types of benefits:

- Materials: Collected once per cycle.
- Other: Always active.

Materials can also be gained from scenario rewards.

If the requirements for a Structure is no longer met, the missing requirement must either be obtained or lose the Structure.

Gangs can build additional Structures in the post-battle sequence (after receiving rewards).

## Starting Out

**Starting credits:** 1000  
**Keep unspent credits:** Yes

A player must select a starting location for their settlement from the list below. This settlement starts with two resources: an Isotopic Fuel Rod and A Water Still. These provide resources at the start of the campaign which can be spend before the first battle.

### Locations

Each gang must choose a location for the gang's settlement. These will limit the capacity of the settlements for different types of Structures (between 1-6).

| Location         | Defence<br />(max Defence Structures) | Resources<br />(max Supply Structures) | Toxicity<br />(max Building Structures) |
| :--------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Factorum Run-off | 3                                     | 6                                      | 3                                       |

## Phases

### Phase 1: Development

- Gain double the amount of Materials from scenario rewards.
- The following scenarios can't be used: Settlement Raid, Market Mayhem, Stealth Attack.

### Phase 2: Downtime

Complete the following steps:

1. [Fighters Recover](/docs/campaigns/dominion-campaign/running-the-campaign#a-fighters-recover)
2. [Captives are Returned](/docs/campaigns/dominion-campaign/running-the-campaign#b-captives-are-returned)
3. [Experienced Juves are Promoted](/docs/campaigns/dominion-campaign/running-the-campaign#c-experienced-juves-and-prospects-are-promoted)
4. [Fresh Recruitment](/docs/campaigns/dominion-campaign/running-the-campaign#d-fresh-recruitment)
5. [Settlement Maintenance](#settlement-maintenance)

#### Settlement Maintenance

Gangs can scrap up to three settlement Structures (removing them and their Benefits from the Settlement Roster sheet), gaining half the Materials used to build them back and then immediately build three new Structures (provided they meet their requirements). Note that a gang cannot scrap a Structure that is a prerequisite for another Structure they own.

## Phase 3: Expansion

All scenarios can be used.

## Ending the Campaign

After Phase 3, the campaign ends. There are a number of Triumphs (depending on campaign type). A gang may earn more than one, and in case of a tie, no one is awarded it.

| Triumphs             | Criteria                                                                             |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Lord of the Badzones | Most Structures                                                                      |
| Outland Raider       | Won the most scenarios as attacker (Settlement Raid, Stealth Attack, Market Mayhem). |
| Outland Defender     | Won the most scenarios as defender (Settlement Raid, Stealth Attack, Market Mayhem). |
| Scavenger            | Won the most scenarios (Gunk Tank, Mining Expedition, Big Score).                    |
| Master of Coin       | Largest Wealth                                                                       |

## Scenario Selection

:::note

It is up to the campaign to organise how they want to choose scenarios. Each gaming group is different and have different approaches. One option is to use the selection table suggested by the campaign designers below.

:::

To determine which scenario will be used, roll 2D6on the following table:

| &nbsp;&nbsp;2D6&nbsp;&nbsp; | Result |
| :-------------------------: | ------ |

| &nbsp;&nbsp;2D6&nbsp;&nbsp; | Result |
| :-------------------------: | ------ |

| 2-3 | The player with the greater number of Structures chooses which scenario to play. If both players have the same number of Structures, both players should roll a D6, with the player who rolls the highest choosing. If the scenario dictates there is an attacker and a defender, the player who chose the scenario decides which player will be the attacker and which will be the defender. |
| 4-5 | Play the [Gunk Tank](/docs/scenarios/scenario-list/gunk-tank) (Development phase) or the [Settlement Raid](/docs/scenarios/scenario-list/settlement-raid) (Expansion phase) scenario. |
| 6-7 | Play the [Mining Expedition](/docs/scenarios/scenario-list/mining-expedition) (Development phase) or the [Market Mayhem](/docs/scenarios/scenario-list/market-mayhem) (Expansion phase) scenario. |
| 8-9 | Play the [Big Score](/docs/scenarios/scenario-list/the-big-score) (Development phase) or the [Stealth Attack](/docs/scenarios/scenario-list/stealth-attack) (Expansion phase) scenario. |
| 10-12 | The player with fewer Structures choose swhich scenario to play. If both players have the same number of Structures, the winner of a roll-off chooses which scenario to play. If the scenario dictates there is an attacker and a defender, the player who chose the scenario decides which player will be the attacker and which will be the defender.
