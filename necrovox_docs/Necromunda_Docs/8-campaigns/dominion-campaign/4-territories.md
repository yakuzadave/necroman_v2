# Territories

_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

All Territories in a Dominion Campaign are unique, and the gangs that hold them will benefit from them in many ways. As a result, competition for certain Territories can become very intense as a campaign progresses. This section gives an overview of what each Territory represents and details the bonuses the Territory grants to the gang that holds it.

All gangs possess a Settlement Territory they cannot lose and which can never be staked on the outcome of
a battle. This represents the gang’s hideout.

## Territory Boons

Each Territory grants the gang that controls it a
benefit called a Boon. This Boon might be income, an
additional gang member, an increase in Reputation, a
piece of rare or unique equipment or a special rule.

A gang receives the benefits of a Territory’s Boon so
long as it holds that Territory. Once the Territory is lost
to another gang, the Boon is lost.

### Income

If a Territory provides income for the gang that controls
it, the gang adds the amount of credits shown to
their Stash when generating income after all battles,
including the battle in which it was won.

### Recruit

Some Territories grant gangs new fighters, Hired Guns
or Hangers-on as recruits to the gang. These recruits
incur no cost to recruit but do add to the Gang Rating
and Wealth value.

Any gang fighter recruited from the gang’s House List
has no cost to recruit, but any equipment that is not
part of the fighter’s basic cost must be purchased at
the normal cost, or supplied from the gang’s Stash.

Any Hired Gun recruited as a Boon has no cost, and
will remain with the gang for as long as they control the
Territory that grants the Boon.

Any Hanger-on recruited as a Boon does not count
towards the maximum number of Hangers-on the gang
may normally have, may be recruited without meeting
the normal Reputation requirement and remains with
the gang for as long as they control the Territory that
grants the boon.

### Equipment

The gang adds the listed equipment type to its Stash.
It is gained in the Post-battle Actions step of the
post-battle sequence, immediately after the battle in
which the Territory was won and can be distributed
amongst eligible fighters during the next step of the
same post-battle sequence.

The equipment can never be sold or traded and if the
Territory is ever lost, then so is the equipment as it can
no longer be maintained without the expertise present
within the Territory.

### Reputation

The gang’s Reputation is increased by the listed value
as a direct result of ownership of that Territory. If they
lose control of the Territory, the bonus is lost.

### Special

The Boon grants a unique benefit to the gang that
holds the Territory. The benefit follows the rules listed
in the relevant entry for the Territory. If the Territory is
ever lost then so is the benefit.

### Enhanced Boons

Some Territories are more important to gangs from a
particular House – an Escher gang might be able to
grudgingly sift some valuables from a Refuse Drift, but
to a Cawdor gang the same refuse pile is a hoard of
hidden relics.

Many Territories grant gangs of a named House one or
more Enhanced Boons, listed below the Territory Boons
for each of the Territories detailed on the following
pages. If the Enhanced Boon is of the same type as the
standard Territory Boon (Income, Recruit, Equipment,
Reputation or Special) then it replaces the standard
Territory Boon.

_For example, the Gambling Den Territory grants two Territory Boons: Reputation and Income. If it is controlled by a Delaque gang, however, they will benefit from two Enhanced Boons: Reputation and Special. This means that a Delaque gang controlling the Gambling Den Territory replaces the standard Reputation Boon with the Enhanced Reputation Boon and gains the Special Boon._

The remaining standard Territory Boons listed for a
Territory are gained as normal by the gang controlling
that Territory, regardless of any Enhanced Boons, meaning the Delaque gang in the example above would
still benefit from the Income Territory Boon as well as
the Reputation and Special Enhanced Boons.

### Gaining And Controlling Territories

The gaining of Territory is at the heart of a Dominion
Campaign. Territory is gained by winning a battle that
has a Territory at stake. The only other way of gaining
a Territory is if two players agree to trade one in
exchange for a Captive.
