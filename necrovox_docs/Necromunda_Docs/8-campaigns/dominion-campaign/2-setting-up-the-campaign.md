# Setting Up The Campaign

_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

Setting up a Dominion Campaign is a task that falls to the Arbitrator. To set up the
campaign, the Arbitrator must make sure that all the players have founded their
gang and been given their starting Territories. This is best done in a single evening
or session, where everyone playing in the campaign meets and goes through all
the steps of setting up the campaign together, and generally gets excited about the
fun ahead.

## Set Start And End Dates

The Dominion Campaign is divided into six campaign cycles, separated by a single
cycle of Downtime after the first three cycles, meaning the campaign will last a total
of seven cycles. For ease, we have set each cycle as a week, as this is usually how
often gaming groups or groups of friends get together to play; however, if the players
choose, then a cycle can represent a longer or shorter period of real time. The first
step in setting up the campaign is for the Arbitrator to determine the start date, the
end date and when the Downtime cycle will fall. They then share this information with
the players.

## Determine Territories

The number of Territories used in a Dominion
Campaign depends on the number of players
committed to the campaign – see the following table:

| Players | Territories Generated |
| :-----: | :-------------------: |
|    3    |           9           |
|    4    |          12           |
|    5    |          15           |
|    6    |          18           |
|    7    |          21           |
|    8    |          24           |

Territories are generated using the following method:

1. For each House represented by a player’s gang, take the cards for those Territories that offer
   Enhanced Boons to gangs of that House and make
   a deck of them.
2. Draw one Territory from each of these House
   decks of cards and put them aside until step 5
   (note: one card is drawn, no matter how many
   gangs there are from an individual House).
3. Take all of the remaining cards, add the cards not
   drawn during step 1 back in, shuffle them together
   and draw a number of additional Territories
   until the number of Territories required for the
   campaign have been drawn.
4. All non-selected Territories are discarded.
5. All of the selected Territories are revealed to all of
   the players

### Making A Deck Of Territories

You can build a deck of Territories by using half a
deck of playing cards to determine the Territories for
a campaign. Remove all Hearts, Clubs and Jokers,
leaving just Spades and Diamonds. Each card in these
remaining suits corresponds to a Territory, as per the
table shown below:

| Card              | Territory            |
| :---------------- | :------------------- |
| Ace of Diamonds   | Settlement           |
| 2 of Diamonds     | Old Ruins            |
| 3 of Diamonds     | Rogue Doc Shop       |
| 4 of Diamonds     | Promethium Cache     |
| 5 of Diamonds     | Wastes               |
| 6 of Diamonds     | Sludge Sea           |
| 7 of Diamonds     | Workshop             |
| 8 of Diamonds     | Collapsed Dome       |
| 9 of Diamonds     | Refuse Drift         |
| 10 of Diamonds    | Corpse Farm          |
| Jack of Diamonds  | Bone Shrine          |
| Queen of Diamonds | Drinking Hole        |
| King of Diamonds  | Gambling Den         |
| Ace of Spades     | Needle Ways          |
| 2 of Spades       | Synth Still          |
| 3 of Spades       | Stinger Mould Sprawl |
| 4 of Spades       | Narco Den            |
| 5 of Spades       | Slag Furnace         |
| 6 of Spades       | Fighting Pit         |
| 7 of Spades       | Smelting Works       |
| 8 of Spades       | Mine Workings        |
| 9 of Spades       | Tunnels              |
| 10 of Spades      | Toll Crossing        |
| Jack of Spades    | Generatorium         |
| Queen of Spades   | Archeotech Device    |
| King of Spades    | Tech Bazaar          |

## Issuing And Accepting Challenges

During a Dominion Campaign, battles are fought on a
challenge basis:

- During each cycle, each player may issue one challenge to another gang to do battle over control of a Territory nominated by the challenger:
  - In the first campaign cycle, challenges are made ina random order.
  - In later cycles, they are made in ascending order
    of Gang Rating, starting with the gang with the
    lowest Gang Rating. If two gangs have the same
    Gang Rating, the winner of a roll-off makes their
    challenge first.
  - During the Occupation phase, the challenger
    nominates one uncontrolled Territory to be the
    stake of the battle. This is then removed from
    the pool by the Arbitrator until the battle is
    concluded. If there are no uncontrolled Territories, the challenger instead nominates one Territory
    controlled by the gang they are challenging to be
    the stake of the battle.
  - During the Takeover phase, the challenger
    nominates one Territory controlled by the gang
    they are challenging to be the stake of the battle.
- If one of a gang’s fighters has been captured by
  another gang, rather than challenging for a Territory, that gang may issue a challenge to the captors to
  play the [Rescue Mission](/docs/scenarios/scenario-list/rescue-mission) scenario.
- When a gang is challenged, they may accept or
  decline. If the challenge is accepted, a battle is
  fought. If the challenge is declined, the Territory is
  automatically claimed by the challenger.
- If a gang receives two or more challenges within a
  single campaign cycle, they may decline the second
  and any subsequent challenges without penalty.
- If a player has played all outstanding battles
  (including their issued challenge and any challenges
  accepted) and there is still time left in the campaign
  cycle, they may issue another challenge.

The gang that wins the battle takes control of the
Territory (or retains control of the Territory, as the case
may be). If the battle results in a draw:

- During the Occupation phase, neither gang takes
  control of the Territory if the Territory is unclaimed.
- During the Takeover phase, the gang that controlled
  the Territory before the battle retains control of
  the Territory.

### Scenario Selection Table

When a challenge is issued, roll 2D6 on the table
below to determine which scenario is used. If the
scenario dictates there is an attacker and a defender, the player that issued the challenge is the attacker.

| &nbsp;&nbsp;2D6&nbsp;&nbsp; | Result                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| :-------------------------: | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|             2-3             | The player with the greater number of Territories chooses which scenario to play. If both players have the same number of Territories, the winner of a roll-off chooses which scenario to play. |
|             4-5             | Play the Border Dispute or the Fuel Hunt scenario.                                                                                                                                              |
|             6-7             | Play the Smash & Grab or the Settlement Raid scenario.                                                                                                                                          |
|             8-9             | Play The Trap or the Cargo Run scenario.                                                                                                                                                        |
|            10-12            | The player with fewer Territories chooses which scenario to play. If both players have the same number of Territories, the winner of a roll-off chooses which scenario to play.                 |

Players should now agree whether they will fight an Underhive or Ash Wastes battle. If they cannot decide, the player who chooses the scenario decides. If neither player chooses the scenario (for example, because a 4-9 was rolled on the table), the players should roll off and the winner’s choice applies.
