# Terrain

_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

As mentioned previously, terrain features prominently
in games of Necromunda. One of the most obvious
ways in which models interact with terrain is when they
attempt to move through and over it. The following
section covers the various ways in which terrain affects
a model’s movement.

## Difficult Terrain

From pools of stagnant sludge or areas of fallen rubble
deep in the underhive, to areas of uneven and rocky
ground in the ash wastes – there are numerous things
that can make terrain difficult to cross.

For every 1" a fighter moves through any terrain
designated as difficult terrain when setting up the
battlefield, it counts as having moved 2".

## Dangerous Terrain

Vats of toxic chems, jagged rocks so sharp they
can tear through plates of armour and drive shafts
with ease, and more besides – any terrain feature
designated as dangerous when setting up the
battlefield can pose a huge risk to models crossing it.

A model may cross dangerous terrain in the same
way as difficult terrain. However, a fighter must also
pass an Initiative test, whilst a vehicle must also
pass a Handling test. If this test is passed, the model
crosses the terrain safely. If it is failed, a fighter will
immediately go [Out of Action](/docs/the-rules/resolve-hits#injury-dice), whilst a
vehicle will suffer an immediate [Catastrophic hit to its Drive](/docs/the-rules/resolve-hits-against-vehicles#drive-damage-table).

### Vehicles And Difficult Terrain

How a vehicle interacts with difficult terrain depends upon how the vehicle moves. This will be indicated in the
vehicle’s rules.

**Wheeled:** Wheeled vehicles are able to reach high speeds but struggle to maintain this speed over rough
terrain. For every 1" a wheeled vehicle moves through difficult terrain, it counts as having moved 2".

**Tracked:** Tracked vehicles are designed to keep going over all terrain – though they struggle to reach high
speeds. A tracked vehicle suffers no penalty for moving over difficult terrain.

**Skimmers:** Skimmers ignore all difficult terrain and dangerous terrain when moving. However, if it ends its
activation on difficult terrain or dangerous terrain, it must make a Handling test. If the test is passed, it has
successfully negotiated the terrain. If it is failed, it suffers an immediate Catastrophic hit to its Drive.

### Fighter Movement On Vehicles

In the ash wastes, gang members scramble over vehicles as they race along, engaging in rooftop fights and
leaping from one vehicle to another.

To represent this, fighters treat vehicles like terrain for the purposes of movement, climbing up the sides and
leaping onto them from gantries (though falling and ending up Prone next to a vehicle is a very dangerous
position to be in!).

However, trying to balance on the roof of a speeding vehicle is a tricky proposition. Whenever a vehicle
moves, any fighters on it, except those on designated transport spaces, must immediately pass an Initiative
test or fall. If they fall, place them 1" away from the vehicle in a direction determined by the Scatter dice after
the vehicle has finished moving. If this causes them to land within ½" of the edge of a platform, they must
test again to avoid [falling](/docs/the-rules/terrain#falling). If it would cause them to hit impassable terrain, move them the
shortest distance so as to be able to be placed. They only need to test once during each vehicle’s activation, though they will also have to test if the vehicle they are on is moved as part of a collision.

Note that objects such as Loot caskets will automatically fall off a vehicle if not placed in a designated
transport area, unless they are in base contact with a fighter which passes its Initiative test.

## Obstacles

Obstacles are any free standing terrain features
measuring no more than 2" high and no more than
2" across, such as barricades, barrels and pipelines. Fighters may cross obstacles as they move, but doing
so reduces their movement by a number of inches
equal to the height of the obstacle. A fighter may not
end their movement on top of an obstacle.

Vehicles may cross obstacles as they move, and in
doing so will destroy the obstacle and cause it to be
removed from the battlefield. However, when moving
across an obstacle in this way, a vehicle may take
damage, see [Colliding with Terrain](/docs/the-rules/vehicle-impacts#colliding-with-terrain).

## Structures (Sturdy & Flimsy)

Structures are any terrain features measuring more
than 2" high or more than 2" across, be they free
standing or connected to other terrain features in some
way. Fighters may climb up and onto structures and
between the various levels and platforms of a structure
as they move, and may end their movement on any
level of a structure if there is sufficient space for their
base (see Climbing later).

Vehicles may suffer damage when colliding with a
structure, and if flimsy the structure will be destroyed
(see [Colliding with Terrain](/docs/the-rules/vehicle-impacts#colliding-with-terrain)).

## Impassable Terrain & Solid Terrain Features

As mentioned previously, any terrain can be
designated impassable when setting up the battlefield, regardless of size. Impassable terrain may include
solid sections of walls, vertiginous towers or towering
vats of molten metal. Models may not move across
impassable terrain.

**Ductways:** Ductways are only present during Zone
Mortalis battles and can be represented either by
a marker placed on or next to a wall, or by a scenic
ductway opening modelled onto the wall itself. Note, however, that such a feature must be present on both
sides of the wall!

A ductway can be up to a maximum of 2" in length and
can be placed across any 2" wide wall or any other
terrain features that would otherwise be impassable. Their presence creates an exception to the rule that
fighters may not move across impassable terrain and
allows fighters to crawl through a narrow duct and
traverse the terrain feature by using the Crawl Through
Ductway (Double) action.

## Climbing

Fighters can climb up or down any vertical surface to
reach a higher level or platform of a structure during
their movement. Vehicles or models with the Mounted
condition may not climb. For every 1" a fighter moves
vertically by climbing, they count as having moved 2".

A fighter cannot end their activation mid-climb; they
must have sufficient movement to reach a flat surface.
If they cannot, they will stay where they were when the
action was declared. Players should note that a fighter
may end a Move (Simple) action mid-climb, provided
that they are able to immediately use another action to
complete the climb.

**Stepping Up:** Whilst moving, a fighter may freely ‘step
up’ onto another level or platform of a structure, provided that it is no more than ½" higher than the
level they are currently on. If the difference in height is
more than ½", they must climb as described previously.

**Overhangs:** When climbing, a fighter can traverse
an overhang as long as it protrudes no more than 1"
from the vertical surface. Overhangs that protrude
more than 1" are considered impassable to a
climbing fighter.

**Ladders & Stairs:** When climbing a ladder or stairs
between the levels of a structure, there are no
modifiers to a fighter’s movement.

## Leaping Gaps

A moving fighter may attempt to leap across any gap
that is bigger than their base, provided that they have
enough Movement to do so. The fighter stops at the
edge and makes an Initiative test. If they pass, they
leap the gap and may continue moving. If they fail, they
will fall straight down by the shortest possible route to the next level down and will suffer a hit as described in [Resolving Hits: Falling](/docs/the-rules/resolve-hits#falling).

## Jumping Down

A fighter may attempt to jump down to a level below
or to Disembark from a vehicle. They must pass an
Initiative test with no modifier for the first 2" jumped, but with a cumulative -1 modifier for every additional 2" jumped (rounded up). If the test is failed, they fall and may suffer a hit as described in [Resolving Hits: Falling](/docs/the-rules/resolve-hits#falling).

**Stepping Down:** Whilst moving, a fighter may freely
‘step down’ onto another level or platform of a
structure, provided that it is no more than ½" lower
than the level they are currently on. If the difference
in height is more than ½", they must jump as
described previously.

## Falling Hazards

A fighter is at risk of falling if they go from Standing
to Prone whilst within ½" of the edge of a level or
platform. Should this happen, the fighter must make an
Initiative test. If the test is passed, nothing happens.
If the test is failed or if a natural 1 is rolled, the fighter
will fall as follows.

**Railings:** If the nearest edge of a level or platform is
bounded by a railing or similar barrier at least ½" tall, the chance of falling is reduced. Add 1 to the result of
the Initiative test to see if the fighter falls.

## Falling

If a fighter falls or fails to Jump Down a distance of 3" or more, they will take a hit as described on in [Resolve Hits: Falling](/docs/the-rules/resolve-hits#falling) based on how far they fell, rounded up to
the nearest inch.

A falling fighter is immediately placed Prone and
Pinned and their activation ends. If they land on top
of another fighter, that fighter also becomes Prone
and Pinned and suffers a hit identical to that taken by
the falling fighter. Move the falling fighter the shortest
possible distance so that the two are not overlapping. Once the hits have been resolved, and if neither fighter
is Prone and Seriously Injured, if the falling fighter
landed on an enemy fighter, move the falling fighter
that fell by the shortest route possible until they are 1"
away from the enemy fighter.

If a falling fighter lands within ½" of a platform edge, they must pass an Initiative test or will fall again.

## Vehicles And Falling

Sometimes, whether due to a particularly foolhardy
driver deliberately driving off or a vehicle losing
control/being rammed, a vehicle will fall off an
elevated height. When this happens the vehicle must
pass a [Loss of Control test](/docs/the-rules/resolve-hits-against-vehicles#loss-of-control-tests) with a
cumulative -1 modifier for every 3" fallen, rounding
up to the nearest inch. In addition they take a hit as described in [Resolve Hits: Falling](/docs/the-rules/resolve-hits#falling), resolving damage against the
Rear Toughness and Drive
