# Vehicle Actions

_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

The following list details all of the core actions vehicles
may perform in Necromunda. This list is by no means
exhaustive, however, with skills, scenarios, special
terrain features and more introducing further actions
that vehicles may perform. As with fighters, vehicles
may perform two actions during their activation.

## Mobile Vehicles

Mobile vehicles can perform a wide range of actions.

#### Move (Simple)

The vehicle may do all of the following:

- Move in a straight line directly forwards a distance
  up to its Movement characteristic.
- Make a single pivot around its centre of up to 90° at   any point before, during or after its move.
- Cross any gap between two platforms that is no wider than the length of the vehicle as long as the initial platform isn’t lower than the target platform (if they try to cross a bigger gap, they will [fall](/docs/the-rules/terrain#vehicles-and-falling)).
- Cross certain terrain features – see [Vehicles and Difficult Terrain](/docs/the-rules/terrain#vehicles-and-difficult-terrain).

#### Manoeuvre (Simple)

The vehicle may do all of the following:

- Move in a straight line directly forwards or backwards
  a distance up to half its Movement characteristic.
- Make any number of pivots around its centre at any
  point before, during or after its move.
- Cross certain terrain features – see [Vehicles and Difficult Terrain](/docs/the-rules/terrain#vehicles-and-difficult-terrain).

#### Move & Shoot (Basic)

The vehicle may move as if making a Move (Simple) action, halving its Movement
characteristic. At any point before, during or after its
move, the vehicle makes a ranged attack with either
one weapon that has the Crew Operated trait or a
sidearm. A vehicle cannot perform both this and the
Fire All (Basic) action in the same activation.

#### Fire All (Basic)

The vehicle may make one ranged
attack with each weapon that has the Crew Operated
trait. A vehicle cannot perform both this and the Move
& Shoot action in the same activation.

#### Reload (Simple)

Pick a weapon on this vehicle with
the Crew Operated trait or a weapon the crew is
equipped with that is Out of Ammo and make an Ammo
test. If the test is passed, the weapon is reloaded and
the Out of Ammo marker is removed.

#### Aim (Basic)

If the vehicle makes a subsequent Fire
All (Basic) action this activation, apply a +1 modifier to
any Hit rolls they make.

#### Drift (Basic)

The vehicle may move up to half its
Movement characteristic in a straight line anywhere
in its Side arc. Once it has finished the move, make
a [Loss of Control test](/docs/the-rules/resolve-hits-against-vehicles#loss-of-control-tests) applying a
+1 modifier.

#### Ram (Double)

The vehicle moves as if making a
Move (Simple) action, adding D6" to the distance it
can move. If, during this movement, it has a headon collision with another vehicle or a terrain feature, this vehicle halves its Movement characteristic when
working out the Strength, AP and damage of the hit it
suffers – the impacted vehicle suffers a hit as normal. After the collision has been resolved, the vehicle’s
activation ends.

#### Spin (Basic)

The vehicle may move as if performing a Move (Simple) action but may turn up to 180° instead
of 90°. Immediately after completing the turn, take a
[Loss of Control test](/docs/the-rules/resolve-hits-against-vehicles#loss-of-control-tests).

#### Full Throttle (Double)

The vehicle moves as if making a Move (Simple) action, but may move up to three
times its Movement characteristic. If it makes a turn at
any point during this move then immediately make a
[Loss of Control test](/docs/the-rules/resolve-hits-against-vehicles#loss-of-control-tests) with a -1 modifier.

## Stationary Vehicles

Stationary vehicles can perform only a limited number
of actions. What these are depends upon their
Secondary Status: Stalled or Wrecked.

### Stationary & Stalled Vehicles

Vehicles that are Stationary and Stalled are able to
perform any of the following actions:

#### Jump Start (Simple)

The driver frantically tries to
restart their vehicle. Make a Handling test for the
vehicle, applying a +1 modifier unless the vehicle only
has 1 HP remaining:

- If the Handling test is passed, the vehicle
  immediately restarts, changing its status to Mobile.
- If the Handling test is failed, the vehicle refuses to
  restart and it remains Stationary and Stalled.

#### Turn-over (Basic)

Whilst trying to restart the vehicle, the engine turns over briefly, allowing the vehicle to
move in small bounds. The vehicle moves as if making
a Move (Simple) action, but may only move D3". Additionally, apply a +1 modifier to the next test to
Restart the vehicle.

#### Free Wheel (Basic)

The driver releases the brakes,
letting gravity pull the vehicle. The vehicle moves as if
making a Move (Simple) action, but it may only move
D6". Additionally, the vehicle will naturally follow the
incline of the battlefield. Roll a D6:

- On a 1-3, the vehicle moves forwards.
- On a 4-6, the vehicle moves backwards.

If the vehicle collides with another vehicle or a terrain
feature during this move, it stops automatically and
collision damage is worked out as normal.

#### Fire All (Basic)

(See previous Fire All entry).

### Stationary & Wrecked Vehicles

Vehicles that are Stationary and Wrecked no longer
participate in the battle. The crew will have gone Out of
Action and fighters on board might have been [thrown clear](/docs/the-rules/resolve-hits-against-vehicles#thrown-clear), and the vehicle itself has been
reduced to a terrain feature. Therefore, a Stationary
and Wrecked vehicle is not given a Ready marker
during the Ready Gang step of the Priority phase, is
not activated during the Action phase, and is unable
to perform any actions.

## Broken Vehicles

Vehicles can be subject to the [Broken Condition](/docs/general-principles/conditions#broken). A Broken vehicle is one that has
lost its nerve; its crew wants nothing more than to get
to a safe place where they can regain their composure.

When activated, if Mobile, any vehicle subject to
the Broken Condition must perform the Break for
Air (Double) action; if Stationary it must perform
the Burn Out (Double) action. Its activation then
immediately ends.

#### Break for Air (Double)

Desperate to escape the chaos
of battle and get some air, the vehicle moves as if
making a Move (Simple) action but moves 3D6" with
no limit to the number of pivots it can make.

When a Broken vehicle moves, it must attempt to end
its move, in order of priority:

- So that it is more than 3" away from enemy models.
- So that it is out of line of sight of enemy models.
- In partial or full cover.
- As far away from any enemy models as possible.

#### Burn Out (Double)

Panicked, the vehicle’s crew try
to restart the vehicle in order to escape. However, repeated attempts to restart it cause thick clouds
of smoke and ash to billow from its exhausts and
wheels. Place D3 markers anywhere within 1" of the
vehicle, each of these markers is subject to the Smoke
weapon trait.

In the End phase of any round in which this action was
performed, the vehicle will suffer a -1 modifier to its
Restart test for each Smoke marker placed.
