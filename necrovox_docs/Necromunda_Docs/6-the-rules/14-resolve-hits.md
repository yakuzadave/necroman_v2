# Resolve Hits

_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

Whenever a successful Hit roll is made against a model, there is a good chance that hit will cause that model to
suffer a degree of damage. Determining how badly damaged a model is and what the effects of that damage are
differs between fighters and vehicles.

## Resolving Hits Against Fighters

When a fighter suffers a Hit, follow this sequence:

1. Make Wound Roll
2. Make a Save Roll
3. Inflict Damage

## 1. Make Wound Roll

Whenever a Wound roll is made against a fighter, it
is always the opposing player that makes it. Cross
reference the weapon’s Strength with the hit fighter’s
Toughness and roll a D6 on the table below to
determine if the fighter is wounded by the attack:

| Strength vs Toughness                               | D6 Roll Required |
| :-------------------------------------------------- | :--------------: |
| Is the Strength **TWICE** the Toughness or greater? |        2+        |
| Is the Strength **GREATER** than the Toughness?     |        3+        |
| Is the Strength **EQUAL** to the Toughness?         |        4+        |
| Is the Strength **LOWER** than the Toughness?       |        5+        |
| Is the Strength **HALF** the Toughness or lower?    |        6+        |

## 2. Make A Save Roll

If a hit results in a successful Wound roll, or leads to
an Injury roll being made against the fighter for any
reason, the fighter may be able to make a Save roll.

Only one Save roll may be made for each hit that
successfully wounds, or leads to an Injury roll being
made, regardless of how many different Save rolls a
fighter may have. For example, if a fighter wears both
mesh armour and a refractor field, they may only
attempt a Save roll against a successful Wound roll
with one of those items.

Save rolls are made either:

- After the Wound roll is made but before the Wound is
  removed from the fighter, in which case the Wound is
  ‘saved’ and not removed.
- If the attack has a Damage ‘-’ characteristic and
  causes an Injury dice to be rolled against the fighter
  for any reason, a Save roll is made before any Injury
  dice are rolled.

Players should note that some weapon traits will
disallow Save rolls. For example, the Gas Weapon trait
states that no Save roll can be made. In such cases, regardless of any modifiers, no Save roll can be made.

**Armour Penetration:** It may happen that the Armour
Penetration (AP) characteristic of a weapon is greater
than the Save roll granted by the armour a fighter
wears, thus cancelling out the Save roll. For example, a fighter wearing mesh armour has a Save roll of 5+, but if they are hit by a weapon with AP -3, no Save roll
would be possible.

**Positive Save Modifiers:** In some situations, such as
a fighter benefitting from partial or full cover against
an attack that uses a Blast marker, a fighter’s Save
roll may be improved. In such situations, this positive
modifier may be added to a fighter’s normal Save roll, but may not be added to Field armour. For example, if a
fighter wearing mesh armour (5+ save) and a displacer
field (4+ save) gains a +1 modifier to their Save roll, they may improve their mesh armour save to 4+ but
may not improve their [displacer field](/docs/armoury/field-armour#displacer-field) save to 3+.

If a fighter not wearing armour benefits from a positive
save modifier, treat their save as 7+ for the purposes
of modification. For example, if a fighter wearing no
armour gains a +2 save modifier, they will be able to
make a Save roll of 5+.

**Rolls of a Natural 1:** A roll of a natural 1 when making
a Save roll is always an automatic failure, regardless of
any modifiers that may apply.

## 3. Inflict Damage

If a successful Wound roll is not saved, damage is inflicted as follows:

1. Each point of Damage caused by a weapon removes one Wound from a fighter.
2. When a fighter is reduced to 0 Wounds by Damage from an attack, immediately roll one Injury dice and apply the result to the fighter (as follows).
3. If the weapon has additional points of Damage to cause after the last Wound
   has been removed, immediately roll an additional Injury dice for each and apply
   the result to the fighter.

_For example, if a fighter with two Wounds is hit by a weapon that causes three points of Damage, two Injury dice will be rolled. The first point of Damage removes a Wound, the second reduces the fighter to 0 Wounds and one Injury dice is rolled, and the third and final point of Damage will cause another Injury dice to be rolled._

### Injury Dice

![](out-of-action.jpg)
![](serious-injury.jpg)
![](flesh-wound.jpg)

When any number of Injury dice are rolled against a fighter for any reason, apply the
results of each individual dice against that fighter as follows:

**Out of Action:** The fighter succumbs to their injuries and is immediately removed
from play and will take no further part in this battle.

**Serious Injury:** If a Standing or Prone and Pinned fighter suffers a Serious Injury
result, they become Prone and Seriously Injured. If they suffer more than 1 Serious
Injury result, each additional result after the first causes them to suffer a Flesh Wound.
If this injury was inflicted in close combat, the fighter may be vulnerable to a [Coup De Grace (Simple)](/docs/the-rules/fighter-actions#coup-de-grace-simple) action.

Should a Prone and Seriously Injured fighter suffer one or more Serious Injury
results, they suffer an additional Flesh Wound for each.

**Flesh Wound:** The fighter suffers a Flesh Wound, reducing their Toughness
characteristic by 1. If a fighter is reduced to Toughness 0, they go Out of Action.

:::info

### Damage ‘ - ’ Weapons

A weapon with a Damage characteristic of ‘-’ does not cause Damage in the
usual way and will not cause a fighter to lose a Wound. Such weapons cause
injuries through the use of deadly toxins, venoms or gas.

Consequently, if any Injury dice are rolled against a fighter as the result of an
attack made by a Damage ‘-’ weapon, the result(s) of the Injury dice are applied
as normal. No Wounds are removed from the fighter.

The fighter may suffer a Flesh Wound, indicating they have been weakened
by the attack, may suffer a Serious Injury, representing their struggle to shake
off the effects of the attack, or may be taken Out of Action as they succumb
to the effects of the weapon.

:::

## Lasting Injuries

Whenever a fighter goes Out of Action, the opposing
player immediately rolls two D6, one after the other (a
D66 roll) and looks up the result on the Lasting Injuries
table (see opposite). During Campaign play, the result
is applied against the fighter and a note of the Lasting
Injury made on the Gang Roster.

If an Injury roll results in more than one Out of Action
result, a separate roll for each is made on the Lasting
Injuries table and each result is applied.

Rolling for Lasting Injuries must be done during
Campaign play. Should players wish, they can forgo
this step during Skirmish play, though making the roll
and noting the result can add greatly to the narrative of
the battle.

:::danger House Rule (A&A)
When a fighter goes Out of Action, only make one Lasting Injury roll, regardless of the number of Out of Action dice.
:::

### Going Into Convalescence

Some results will cause a fighter to go into
Convalescence. During Campaign play, this means
that the fighter cannot perform any post-battle actions
or work any Territories. However, unlike going into
Recovery, they will be available to fight in the gang’s
next battle.

### Going Into Recovery

Some results will cause a fighter to go into Recovery. During Campaign play, this means that the fighter
cannot take part in their gang’s next battle, as they are
recovering from their injuries.

The fighter’s In Recovery box on the gang roster is
checked, and the fighter must miss both the post- battle sequence of the current battle and their gang’s
next battle. This means that a fighter with the Gang
Hierarchy (X) special rule that has gone into Recovery
may not perform post-battle actions at this time. During
the Wrap-up of the gang’s next battle, the fighter’s
In Recovery box will be cleared, the fighter becomes
available once again and Leaders and Champions may
perform post-battle actions.

Note that no matter how many Lasting Injury rolls are
made, a fighter that goes into Recovery will only miss
one battle rather than multiple battles.

### Falling

As described in [Terrain: Falling](/docs/the-rules/terrain#falling), should a model ever fall 3" or more, they will suffer an automatic hit. The Strength, AP and Damage of this hit is determined by how far the model fell, rounded up to the nearest inch:

| Distance Fallen | Strength | AP  | Damage |
| :-------------: | :------: | :-: | :----: |
|      3"-5"      |    3     |  -  |   1    |
|      6"-7"      |    5     | -1  |   1    |
|      8"-9"      |    7     | -2  |   2    |
|      10"+       |    9     | -3  |   3    |

:::info

### Characteristic Reductions

Some results on the Lasting Injury table cause a
permanent reduction to a fighter’s characteristics. Their Fighter card must be amended immediately
and a note of the injury suffered made in the
Captured By/Lasting Injury box of the gang roster
for the injured fighter – note that their Credits
value does not change. No characteristic may ever
be reduced below the [minimum shown on the table](/docs/gang-fighters-and-their-weaponry/fighter-profiles#fighter-characteristics-profiles). Should a Lasting Injury cause a
characteristic to be reduced below the minimum, the characteristic is not reduced.

|             66              | **Memorable Death:** The fighter is killed instantly – not even the most talented Doc can save them. If the injury was caused by an Attack action, the attacker gains 1 additional XP.                                                                                                                         |

## Nerve Tests

Seeing friends and comrades suffering serious injury
can have quite a profound effect upon even the most
hardened of underhive gangers. Therefore, fighters
have to take a Nerve test when a friendly fighter is
Prone and Seriously Injured or taken Out of Action
within 3" of them, or a friendly vehicle is Wrecked
within 6" of them.

All fighters must test regardless of their Status and Secondary Status, though it should be noted that some fighters may be subject to a special rule that makes them immune to Nerve tests.

:::note
No Nerve test is required when a Juve/Prospect is taken Out of Action, except by other Juves/Prospects.
:::

To make a Nerve test, make a Cool test for the fighter, applying a +1 modifier for each friendly fighter within
3" of them that is not Broken and is not Prone and
Seriously Injured:

- If the test is passed, nothing happens.
- If the test is failed, the fighter becomes Broken. Place a Broken marker on their Fighter card to
  indicate that the fighter is subject to the Broken
  condition:
  - As soon as a fighter becomes Broken, they will
    immediately activate (even if they have already
    been activated this round) and make a [Running for Cover (Double)](/docs/the-rules/fighter-actions#running-for-cover-double) action.
  - If the fighter is Ready, they lose their Ready marker.
- Broken fighters may be rallied in the End phase, as described in [Rally Tests](/docs/the-rules/the-end-phase#4-rally-tests).
- When a Broken fighter activates in a subsequent
  round, they may not make any actions other than Running for Cover (Double).
- If a Broken fighter is engaged by an enemy fighter, they may only make Reaction attacks with a
  -2 modifier.

:::info

### Vehicles And Nerve Tests

Whilst seeing fighters taken out does not faze the
average vehicle driver (after all, they are protected
inside their vehicle), they may become panicked
upon seeing other vehicles destroyed. Therefore, vehicles have to take a Nerve test whenever a
friendly vehicle is Wrecked with 6" of them. All
vehicles must test regardless of their Status and
Secondary Status, though some vehicles may be
subject to a special rule that makes them immune
to Nerve tests.

To make a Nerve test, make a Cool test for the
vehicle, applying a +1 modifier for each friendly
vehicle within 6" of them that is not Broken and is
not Stationary and Wrecked:

- If the test is passed, nothing happens.
- If the test is failed, the vehicle becomes Broken. Place a Broken marker on their Vehicle card to
  indicate that the vehicle is subject to the Broken
  condition:
  - As soon as a vehicle becomes Broken, they
    will immediately activate (even if they have
    already been activated this round) and if
    mobile will make a [Break For Air (Double)](/docs/the-rules/vehicle-actions#break-for-air-double)
    action, or if Stationary and Stalled make
    a [Burn Out (Double)](/docs/the-rules/vehicle-actions#burn-out-double) action.
  - If the vehicle is Ready, they lose their
    Ready marker.
- Broken vehicles may be rallied in the End phase, as described in [Rally Tests](/docs/the-rules/the-end-phase#4-rally-tests).
- When a Broken vehicle activates in a
  subsequent round, they may not make any
  actions other than Break For Air (Double)
  if Mobile or Burn Out (Double) if Stationary
  and Stalled.
