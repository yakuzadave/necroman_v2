# The Action Phase

_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

The Action phase consists of just one step:

1. Activate Gang: Starting with the player that holds
   Priority, players take turns to choose one of their
   Ready fighters or vehicles to activate.

## 1. Activate Gang

The bulk of a game of Necromunda takes place
during the Action phase. The Action phase consists of
play alternating back and forth between the players, activating individual models one at a time, or small
groups of fighters as part of a ‘Group Activation’ (as follows).

When it is a player’s turn, they choose one of the
models within their gang that is Ready and perform
a number of actions with it. This is referred to as
‘activating’ the model. The number of actions a model
can perform depends upon its type:

- When activated, a model may perform up to two
  actions, depending upon the type of actions it
  chooses to perform.
- Sometimes a model may only be able to perform one
  action when activated. In such cases, the types of
  action it can choose to perform are limited to Simple, Basic and Free (see [Types of Action](/docs/the-rules/types-of-action)).
- Sometimes a model may be able to perform
  additional actions when activated. In such cases, the rules will specify either the type of action or a
  specific action.

The actions a Ready model can perform are governed
by its current Status and Secondary Status. Players
should note that certain Conditions will also limit the
actions a model may make, most notably Broken. For
example, a fighter subject to the Broken condition may
only make a Running for Cover (Double) action when
activated, regardless of Status or Secondary Status.

If one player runs out of models to activate, the other
player can activate all of their remaining models in an
order of their choosing. Once all models have been
activated, even if they performed no actions during
their activation, the Action phase ends.

### Group Activations

Some fighters, most notably Leaders and Champions, have a special rule called ‘Group Activation (X)’ listed
on their profile. In all such cases, the ‘X’ in brackets
will be replaced by a number (usually 1 or 2). When a
player activates such a fighter, they can choose to use
this special rule, allowing them to activate additional
Ready fighters at the same time as the fighter (note
that only fighters can be activated as part of a group
activation, vehicles cannot):

**Group Activation (X):** When a fighter with this special
rule is activated, their controlling player can choose to
activate a number of additional Ready friendly fighters
equal to the number shown in brackets that are within
3" of this fighter as part of a ‘Group Activation’:

- The controlling player must nominate all of the
  fighters who will be activated in this way before any
  of them are activated.
- Once all participants of the Group Activation have
  been nominated, the controlling player selects one
  and activates them as normal, fully resolving their
  activation before selecting and activating the next.
  Each fighter activates individually; groups do not
  activate simultaneously.

Additional fighters with this special rule activated in
this way may not themselves use this special rule
during this activation.
