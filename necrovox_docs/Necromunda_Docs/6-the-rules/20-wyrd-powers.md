# Wyrd Powers

_Source: Book of the Outcast_

_All across Necromunda, there are those touched by the malign influence of the Warp. Some of these individuals are even able to tap into this immaterial realm and channel its power, manifesting psychic abilities that defy the laws of nature and Mankind. While the Imperium severely sanctions anyone with these abilities, or anyone in league with them, it does not stop psykers from propagating throughout Necromunda. Known among the underhive as wyrds, those with psychic gifts are much sought after by gangs, Guilds and criminals alike to provide an edge in the endless wars between the Clan Houses. Some wyrds even band together to form their own gangs, becoming the scourge of the underhive – at least until they are hunted down and exterminated!_

This section, designed to work alongside the rules for
psykers presented in the Necromunda Rulebook, greatly
expands upon the Wyrd Powers available to players and
Arbitrators in their games. Presented here are seven
Wyrd Power disciplines that can be used by psykers:
Biomancy, Chronomancy, Divination, Pyromancy,
Technomancy, Telepathy and Telekinesis.

## Using Wyrd Power Disciplines

Any fighter with the Sanctioned Psyker special rule or
Non-sanctioned Psyker special rule can make use of
the disciplines presented here using the guidelines
below. Unless allowed by the Arbitrator, Dramatis
Personae cannot use these discipline powers, and
must instead use the powers presented with their
profiles (as they are unique individuals often with
unique powers).

- Unless otherwise specified, all fighters with the
  Sanctioned Psyker or Non-sanctioned Psyker special
  rule start with a single Wyrd Power, either chosen
  from those included in their gang list or from one of
  the disciplines presented here.
- [Bounty Hunters](/docs/gangs/gang-additions/hired-guns/bounty-hunters/#0-1-generic-bounty-hunter) and [Venator Hunt Leaders](/docs/gangs/gang-lists/venators#hunt-leader-leader) can be upgraded
  when hired to have the Sanctioned Psyker or Nonsanctioned Psyker special rule (as chosen by the
  player) for +35 credits.
- A Sanctioned Psyker or Non-sanctioned Psyker
  may choose any Wyrd Power from those presented
  here (instead of one from their gang list) as an
  Advancement, just as they would gain a Primary skill
  as an Advancement (either by generating a power
  randomly for 9 XP, or choosing one for 12 XP).
- There is no limit to the number of Wyrd Powers a
  fighter may know.
- If all of a fighter‘s Wyrd Powers are chosen from a single Wyrd Power discipline, they will automatically gain that discipline’s special ability. Note, however,
  that should the fighter ever gain a power from a different discipline, this ability is immediately lost.
- Finally, when a fighter takes a dose of Ghast,
  they may generate their Wyrd Power from those presented here; this must still be a random Wyrd Power, though you may choose which discipline the power is from.

### Force Weapons

Some rare melee weapons, commonly known as force weapons in the vernacular of the
underhive, are specially attuned to those with wyrd powers and can be devastating killing
tools in their hands. Such weapons are usually created by taking high-quality versions of mundane close combat weapons, which are then inlaid with psi-amplifiers that channel the power of the Warp, allowing the wielder to deliver killing blows accentuated by their own wyrd powers.

Any weapon with the Melee trait can be upgraded into a Force Weapon by buying a Psi-amplifier from the Trading Post and performing the Psi Attune post-battle action (see page 127).

In the hands of a non-psyker, a Force Weapon has no additional effects. However, when
wielded by a fighter with either the Sanctioned Psyker or Non-sanctioned Psyker special
rule, the weapon gains both the Power and Sever traits.

## Biomancy Discipline

_Biomancy is the psychic mastery of flesh and bone; those gifted in its practise are able to knit flesh together, turn their skin to iron or inflict crippling pain upon their enemies. Such individuals are known as biomancers and are often skilled fighters who use their gifts to shrug off wounds while enhancing their speed, strength and endurance to overcome their foes._

### Biomancer Special Ability

If a Wyrd only selects powers from the Biomancy discipline, they gain the Fast Healing special rule:

**Fast Healing:** When this fighter makes a Recovery test, roll an extra Injury dice then choose one to discard.

### 1. Arachnosis (Basic), Continuous Effect

_The wyrd’s hands grow tiny serrated hairs across their palms, allowing them to cling to any surface with ease._

While this Wyrd Power is maintained, the fighter counts as having the [Clamber](/docs/gang-fighters-and-their-weaponry/skills#2-clamber), [Catfall](/docs/gang-fighters-and-their-weaponry/skills#1-catfall) and [Mighty Leap](/docs/gang-fighters-and-their-weaponry/skills#4-mighty-leap) skills.

### 2. Chameleon (Basic), Continuous Effect

_The wyrd’s skin mottles and shifts through a range of hues until it matches their surroundings, making them all but invisible._

While this Wyrd Power is maintained, ranged attacks targeting this fighter suffer a -2 modifier to their hit roll, provided the fighter does not move during their activation.

### 3. Cause Pain (Basic)

_With a twist of their hand, the wyrd causes their foe to double over in unspeakable agony._

Choose an enemy fighter that has already lost at least one
Wound or suffered at least one Flesh Wound and that is within 18" and line of sight of
this fighter. That fighter must roll an Injury dice and immediately apply the effects.

### 4. Stop Bleeding (Basic)

_Focusing their power on a wounded ally, the wyrd closes up their wounds._

Choose a friendly fighter that has suffered at least one Flesh Wound and
that is within 18" and line of sight of this fighter. That fighter immediately removes any
Flesh Wounds they currently have.

### 5. Quickening (Basic), Continuous Effect

_The wyrd pours psychic energy into their muscles, greatly increasing their reflexes._

While this Wyrd Power is maintained,
improve this fighter’s Movement characteristic by 3 and their Weapon Skill, Ballistic
Skill and Initiative characteristics by 1 (to a maximum of 2+).

### 6. Iron Arm (Basic), Continuous Effect

_With a thought, the wyrd turns the flesh of their arm to unyielding iron, allowing them to block any blow directed at them._

While this Wyrd Power is maintained, the fighter gains a special 5+ save against attacks
made against them in close combat. This save may be made after any save rolls for
armour, and is not modified by AP.

## Chronomancy Discipline

_Among the strangest of all wyrds are those who can manipulate the very flow of time itself. Some would say that the chronomancer, as such psykers are known, do not actually alter time, but rather people’s perception of it, allowing them to seem to move as a blur, pass in and out of existence seemingly at will, or even freeze a moment in time to take perfect aim before allowing events to continue._

### Chronomancer Special Ability

If a wyrd only selects powers from the Chronomancy discipline, they gain the Flicker special rule:

**Flicker:** Once per battle, this fighter may perform one additional action during their activation.

### 1. Freeze Time (Double)

_Reality seems to thicken all around the fighter, and events slow down to a crawl – has time truly stopped, or are those caught in the power merely experiencing its flow differently?_

All fighters, friend and foe, within 12" of this fighter may only perform a single action when activated for the remainder of this round.

### 2. Suppress Power (Basic)

_Reaching out with their mind, the fighter cuts an enemy psyker off from their ability – as if it was never there to begin with._

Choose one enemy psyker that is within 18" and line of sight of this fighter. This fighter chooses one of the target’s Wyrd Powers – that power may not be used this round.

### 3. Zen Shootist (Basic), Continuous Effect

_Time stops dead for the fighter, allowing them to casually line up a shot as if their enemy were standing still._

While this Wyrd Power is maintained, this fighter’s BS is improved to 2+ and they ignore negative hit modifiers due to cover. These benefits do not apply if this fighter is firing a weapon with either the Blast (X) trait or Rapid Fire (X) trait.

### 4. Walk Through Walls (Double)

_Reality flickers as the fighter is in one place and then, as if individual picts had been removed from a vid feed, suddenly another._

Place this fighter anywhere within 8" of their current position. They may not be placed within 1" of an enemy fighter.

### 5. Mirror Image (Basic)

_A blur of motion surrounds the fighter as if they are standing in a dozen places at once, making it impossible for their foes to pick out the true target._

Until the End phase of this round, all hit rolls made against this fighter suffer a -1 modifier. In addition, if this fighter makes the Retreat (Basic) action, they may not be targeted by Reaction attacks.

### 6. Lucky Aura (Basic), Continuous Effect

_Little things just seem to go this wyrd’s way, each one seemingly insignificant but adding up to more than mere coincidence._

While this Wyrd Power is maintained, once per round, this fighter may force an enemy fighter to re-roll one successful BS or WS check if this fighter is the target of the attack.

## Divination Discipline

_The ability to peer into the future is something common to many wyrds, for it is believed that the Warp, and its denizens, do not obey the normal constraints of time and space. Diviners, as wyrds talented in this discipline are known, are in high
demand among the gangs and organisations of the underhive; for who wouldn’t want to be able to look into the future and anticipate the actions of their enemies before they even happen?_

### Diviner Special Ability

If a wyrd only selects powers from the Divination discipline, they gain the Future
Sight special rule:

**Future Sight:** Once per battle, this fighter may use this ability to re-roll any dice
roll made during their activation. This ability may be used to re-roll any number of
dice and may even be used on a roll made by an enemy fighter.

### 1. Precognition (Special)

_The wyrd peers into the future to see what fate has in store for them._

If this fighter is part of a gang during the Determine Scenario step of the
pre-battle sequence, their gang may choose the scenario rather than rolling randomly.
If the scenario has an attacker and a defender, the gang this fighter belongs to is
automatically the attacker. If both gangs have a wyrd with this power, they have no
effect as they cancel each other out.

### 2. Foreboding (Double), Continuous Effect

_Glimpsing moments in the near future, this wyrd predicts the movements of their enemies and guns them down._

While this Wyrd Power is maintained, the fighter may either gain the [Overwatch](/docs/gang-fighters-and-their-weaponry/skills/#6-overwatch) skill or grant the
Overwatch skill to a single friendly fighter that is both within 12" and line of sight of
this fighter.

### 3. Misfortune (Basic)

_Picking the perfect moment to act, the wyrd exploits their enemy’s slightest misfortune._

At any point prior to the End phase of this round, this
fighter may force one enemy fighter that is currently both within 12" and line of sight of
this fighter to re-roll a single dice roll.

### 4. Forewarning (Basic)

_A feeling overcomes the wyrd, warning them of the slightest danger to their life._

Until the End phase of this round, the first time this fighter is hit by
an attack roll a D6. On a 2+, the hit is ignored.

### 5. Warp Whispers (Special)

_Conversing with denizens of the Warp, the wyrd learns how best to exploit their current situation._

While this fighter is part of a gang, that
gang may increase their Crew size by 1 for the scenario, and may re-roll any rolls for
Reinforcements. In addition, if this fighter is a sentry, the alarm will automatically be
raised if they finish their movement within 6" of an enemy fighter.

### 6. Visions (Double), Continuous Effect

_Enemies cannot hide from the wyrd while their gaze is fixed upon the Warp._

While this Wyrd Power is maintained, all enemy
fighters within 18" of this fighter that are in full cover count as being in partial cover,
and all enemy fighters within 18" of this fighter that are in partial cover count as being
in the open.

## Pyromancy Discipline

_Pyromancers are wyrds with the ability to conjure flames out of thin air. Exceedinglydeadly individuals, there is nothing subtle about their powers, the psyker abletoturnabattlefield into a blazing inferno with a snap of their fingers._

### Pyromancer Special Ability

If a wyrd only selects powers from the Pyromancy discipline, they gain the Fire Shield special rule:

**Fire Shield:** This fighter cannot be set on fire. In other words, this fighter is immune to the Blaze condition and will never become subject to it.

### 1. Body of Flame (Basic), Continuous Effect

_The wyrd’s body bursts into flames!_

While this Wyrd Power is maintained, this fighter ignores hits from weapons with the Blaze or Melta traits. In addition, if a fighter ends their activation within 1" of this fighter they must test to see if they are set on fire, as if they had been hit by a weapon with the Blaze trait.

### 2. Stoke Flames (Basic)

_With a gesture, the wyrd causes flames to roar to life from the smallest embers._

Choose an enemy fighter that is both within 18" and line of sight
of this fighter and that is currently subject to the Blaze condition. Centre a 5" Blast
marker over the chosen fighter. All fighters touched by this marker must immediately test to see if they are set on fire just as if they had been hit by a weapon with the Blaze trait.

### 3. Wall of Flame (Basic), Continuous Effect

_Fire erupts from the air to engulf an area of the battlefield._

Place a 5" Blast marker so that its centre is anywhere that is both within 12" and line of sight of this fighter. Once placed, this marker does not move but will remain in place while this Wyrd Power is maintained. Any fighter
that either begins or ends their activation touching the marker suffers a Strength 3,
Damage 1, AP 1 hit as if from a weapon with the Blaze trait.

### 4. Flame Blast (Basic), Continuous Effect

_Flames envelope one of the wyrd’s weapons, causing anything touched by it to similarly burst into fire._

While this Wyrd Power is maintained, one weapon with the Melee or Versatile trait carried by this fighter gains the Blaze trait.

### 5. Molten Bolt (Basic)

_The fighter lets loose a super heated bolt of energy._

Target a single enemy fighter that is both within 6" and line of sight of this fighter and make a hit roll, using this fighter’s BS. If a hit is scored, it is resolved at Strength 8, Damage 3, AP -3 as if from a weapon with the Melta trait.

### 6. Scouring (Basic), Continuous Effect

_Opening their mouth in a silent roar, the fighter vomits fire._

While this Wyrd Power is maintained, this fighter counts as being armed with the following weapon:

| Profile  | Rg S | Rg L | Acc S | Acc L | Str | AP  | D   | Ammo | Traits          |
| -------- | ---- | ---- | ----- | ----- | --- | --- | --- | ---- | --------------- |
| Scouring | -    | T    | -     | -     | 2   | -   | 1   | -    | Blaze, Template |

## Technomancy Discipline

_A strange and rare power, technomancy is the ability to psychically manipulate technology of all kinds. Technomancers, as wyrds who command these abilities are known, can with a mere thought cause weapons to fail or operate far past their
peak performance, or harden a suit of armour. In the depths of the underhive, a technomancer is truly in their element, as they use their powers to turn the very battlefield against their enemies._

### Technomancer Special Ability

If a wyrd only selects powers from the Technomancy discipline, they gain the
Techno-affinity special rule:

**Techno-affinity:** This fighter may re-roll any Ammo check they are required to make.

### 1. Weapon Jinx (Simple)

_With a snap of their fingers, the wyrd causes an enemy’s weapon to malfunction._

Choose an enemy fighter that is within 18" of this fighter.
That enemy fighter must immediately make an Ammo check for one of their weapons,
chosen by this fighter.

### 2. Overcharge (Basic), Continuous Effect

_Directing their power into their weapon, the wyrd greatly increases its effectiveness._

While this Wyrd Power is maintained, one
ranged weapon carried by this fighter improves its Strength by 2 and its Damage by 1,
but gains the Unstable trait.

### 3. Hardening (Basic), Continuous Effect

_With a thought, the wyrd renders their armour as thick and heavy as sheet iron._

While this Wyrd Power is maintained, this
fighter improves their save rolls by 2 (to a maximum of 2+), or gains a 5+ save if they
did not have a save before. However, while this power is maintained, this fighter must
reduce their Movement by 1, to a minimum of 1.

### 4. Manipulate Door (Simple)

_The wyrd causes doors to open or close with a wave of their hand._

This fighter may immediately open or close a single unlocked door anywhere on the battlefield.

### 5. Manipulate Lumens (Double)

_Unleashing their power, the wyrd can either cause all power to the dome to cease, plunging it into darkness, or bring ancient power systems back to life and illuminate the gloom._

The [Pitch Black rules](/docs/battlefield-setup/scenario-rules#pitch-black--visibility) immediately come into effect, or immediately end if they were already in effect.

### 6. Crack Lock (Basic)

_With a snap of their fingers, the wyrd causes electronic and mechanical locks to open._

Choose a single locked door that is within 18" of this fighter. That door immediately becomes unlocked and open. Alternatively, this fighter may immediately open a Loot casket anywhere on the battlefield, choosing its contents
rather than rolling randomly.

## Telekinesis Discipline

_Reaching out with their mind, a telekinetic can lift, hurl or crush objects without ever laying a finger on them; some are even able to use their powers to fly._

### Telekinetic Special Ability

If a wyrd only selects powers from the Telekinesis discipline, they gain the Fistsof
Fury special rule:

**Fists of Fury:** When this fighter makes an unarmed attack, increase both theStrength and Damage characteristics of the attack by 1.

### 1. Assail (Basic)

_With a grunt, the wyrd pushes a person or an object away._

Target a single enemy fighter or obstacle that is both within 12" and line of sight of this fighter
and make a hit roll, using this fighter’s BS. If a hit is scored, move the target D3" in any direction – if they were Standing, they become Prone and Pinned after moving. If they come into base contact with a Standing fighter or any terrain, they stop moving and suffer a Strength 3, Damage 1, AP - hit. If they come into base contact with another
fighter, that fighter also suffers a Strength 3, Damage 1, AP - hit and becomes Prone and Pinned.

### 2. Crush (Basic)

_Closing their fist in the air, the wyrd crushes an object or person in their eyeline._

Target a single enemy fighter or obstacle that is both within 12" and line of sight of this fighter and make a hit roll, using this fighter’s BS. If a hit is scored, an obstacle is destroyed and removed from the battlefield, while an enemy fighter must
make a save roll. If this save roll is successful, roll an Injury dice and immediately apply the result against the fighter.

### 3. Force Field (Basic), Continuous Effect

_Casting their power around them, the wyrd shields themselves and those near them from attack._

While this Wyrd Power is maintained, this fighter and any friendly fighters within 3" of them improve their save rolls by 1 or, if they do not have a save, gain a 6+ save roll.

### 4. Hailstorm (Basic)

_The wyrd gathers up and flings underhive debris at their enemies with the power of their mind._

### 5. Force Blast (Basic)

_Telekinetic energy blasts away anything standing near the wyrd._

Any enemy fighters that are within 3" of this fighter are immediately pushed D3+1" directly away. If this movement would push a fighter from a platform or pitfall,
stop them at the edge and take an Initiative test for them. If the test is passed, they are placed Prone at the edge. If the test is failed, they will fall. If this movement is interrupted by a wall or other impassable terrain, the fighter is immediately Pinned and takes a hit with a Strength equal to the number of inches rolled for the push distance.

### 6. Levitation (Basic) Continuous Effect

_Concentrating, the wyrd rises into the air._

While this Wyrd Power is maintained this fighter’s Movement is increased by 3" and they ignore all terrain, may move freely between levels without restriction, and can never fall. They may not, however, ignore impassable terrain or walls and may not end their movement with their base overlapping an obstacle or another fighter’s base.

## Telepathy Discipline

_Few wyrds are as feared as those who practise the discipline of telepathy. A telepath can tear secrets from another’s mind, make them think the wyrd has vanished even when they stand directly in front of them, or fill their foes with unreasoning terror. These wyrds are both the least trusted and the most coveted of all psykers on Necromunda._

### Telepath Special Ability

If a wyrd only selects powers from the Telekinesis discipline, they gain the Fearful
Aura special rule:

**Fearful Aura:** If an enemy makes a Charge (Double) action that would result in
them making one or more close combat attacks against this fighter, they must
make a Willpower check before moving. If the check is failed, they cannot move
and their action ends immediately.

### 1. Mind Control (Basic), Continuous Effect

_The wyrd reaches into a foe’s brain and takes control of their actions._

Choose a single enemy fighter that is both within 9" and line of sight of this fighter. That fighter immediately makes a Shoot (Basic) action, even if they have already activated this round, targeting an eligible fighter from their gang,
chosen by this fighter.

### 2. Terrify (Double)

_Planting a horrific image in an enemy’s mind, the wyrd tries to break their spirit._

sight of this fighter. That fighter must immediately take a Nerve test with a -3 modifier
applied to the roll or become subject to the Broken condition.

### 3. Invisibility (Double), Continuous Effect

_The wyrd clouds the minds of their foes, making it seem as if they have vanished._

While this Wyrd Power is maintained, this
fighter cannot be targeted by ranged attacks. If for any reason this fighter makes any
action other than a Move (Simple) action or a Maintain Control (Simple) action, this
power immediately ends.

### 4. Mental Assault (Basic)

_The wyrd unleashes a brutal mental attack, driving their foe to their knees._

Choose a single enemy fighter that is both within 12" and line of
sight of this fighter. Both this fighter and the target must make a Willpower check.
If both checks are failed, or the target passes and this fighter does not, there is
no further effect. If both this fighter and the target pass, or this fighter passes and
the target fails, the target becomes Prone and Pinned (if possible) and loses their
Ready marker.

### 5. Hallucinations (Basic)

_Delving deep into the subconscious of their foe, the wyrd dredges up every dream and horror they can find, making the victim doubt their very reality._

Choose an enemy fighter that is within 12" of this fighter. That fighter
immediately becomes subject to the Insane condition.

### 6. Unbreakable Will (Basic), Continuous Effect

_Reaching out with their mind, the wyrd tries to calm the thoughts of those around them._

Whenever a friendly fighter takes a Nerve test or makes a Willpower check whilst within 9" of this fighter, they may
use this fighter’s Cool or Willpower characteristic instead of their own.
