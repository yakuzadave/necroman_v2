# Rolling Dice

_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

A game of Necromunda uses dice rolls a great deal. The roll of a dice determines everything, be it a fighter’s ability to keep their cool in the heat of battle, or the effectiveness of a shot fired from a lasgun. Throughout the rules, players will encounter certain terms that relate to the rolling of dice.

## Single Dice Rolls

The rules will often require a player to roll a single dice,
in which case the rules will state quite simply ‘roll a
D6’. Sometimes the rules might require several single
dice to be rolled at once, for example, ‘roll three D6’
means three dice are rolled together, but the result of
each dice is considered separately.

## Multiple Dice Rolls

Often the rules will require a player to roll multiple D6s
and add the results together. For example, the rules
might instruct a player to ‘roll 2D6’. In such cases, two
D6 are rolled and the results added together to give a
total between 2 and 12. This is a multiple dice roll.

## Dice Pools

Sometimes the game may require two or more dice
be rolled and a single result selected – for example, a
player might roll two or three Location dice and select
one result to apply. In this case a ‘pool’ of dice has
been rolled.

## Target Number Rolls

Usually, when making a single dice roll or a multiple
dice roll, the rules will require a player to roll a specific
number followed by a ‘+’. This indicates that the roll is
a ‘target number roll’. Making a target number roll is
simple. If a player is required to roll a 4+ on a single
D6, for example, a roll of 4, 5 or 6 would be a success, but a roll of 1, 2 or 3 would not be.

## Modifying Dice Rolls

The rules will often call for a dice roll to be modified, particularly when making a target number roll. To do this, simply roll the dice and then add or subtract the
modifier(s) shown, effectively changing the outcome of
the dice roll. If the rules ever require a player to divide
a dice roll in any way, any fractions should be rounded
up, unless the rules state otherwise.

## Rolling Off

The rules may call for both players to roll a dice (usually
either a D6 or a D3). Often a characteristic of some
sort will be added to the result. This is called ‘rolling
off’ and the highest score always wins a roll-off. In the
case of a tie, roll again unless otherwise instructed.

## Natural Rolls

A ‘natural’ roll is the actual number rolled on a dice, regardless of modifiers (including the halving of the result rolled on a D6 when rolling it as a D3). It is not
uncommon for a natural roll to grant a bonus or a
penalty, or to grant an automatic success or cause
an automatic failure, regardless of any modifiers that
might apply to the dice roll.

## Re-rolls

When rolling dice, it is common for things to go wrong!
Fortunately, there are many special rules that allow for
certain dice rolls to be re-rolled:

- The second result must always be accepted, even if it is worse than the original result.
- A dice can never be re-rolled more than once, regardless of the source of the re-roll.
