# Tactics

:::info
You are viewing the archived rules from before the 2023 Core books. Use the menu to navigate to the current rules.
:::

Most scenarios will specify if Tactics cards are used, how many and how they are drawn.

There are 3 ways of using tactics:

- Tactics cards
- Zone Mortalis Tactics (Zone Mortalis battlefield)
- Tactics tables (limited to some gangs only)

Decide and agree which one to use.

## Tactics Cards

:::info Tactics Cards
Tactics cards can be viewed in the [dedicated Tactics section](/tactics).
:::

There are no rules for how a deck of Tactics are made. Some prefer to have separate decks per gang, others may use a shared deck to draw from.

Some cards have limitations for what type of battlefield they can be used on (Zone Mortalis or Sector Mechanicus), and some cards are limited to a specific type of gang. If a card is drawn that is limited to a different gang or a different type of terrain, simply discard it and draw another.

Draw cards as described in the scenario. There are 2 ways to draw:

- **Random (X):** Draw X cards randomly.
- Custom (X):\*\* Choose X cards.

:::danger House Rule (Necrodamus)
A better alternative to selecting cards:

- Draw X+3 random cards, keep X cards.

This gives a range of benefits:

- Noob friendly: New players can select cards much faster, instead of reading through a big deck of 200+ cards they have never seen before.
- Less cards required: The same deck can be shared among players, so only a single deck is required.
- Diversity: Avoid boring choices where the best cards are selected every game.

:::

## Zone Mortalis Tactics

Alternatively, if the battlefield is Zone Mortalis, tactics can be drawn using only the special Zone Mortalis deck.

Each gang can draw the amount specified by the scenario, randomly from the 12 universal tactics.
Then, any gang can replace one of the cards with the 1 gang specific Zone Mortalis Tactic (specific to the gang).

## Determine Tactics From Table

Alternatively, some gangs can roll on a gang specific table instead of drawing cards. Roll a D36 (D3x10+D6) to determine the tactics.
