# Pre-battle Sequence

:::info
You are viewing the archived rules from before the 2023 Core books. Use the menu to navigate to the current rules.
:::

1.  Make a Challenge
1.  Recruit Hired Guns
1.  Determine Scenario
1.  Draw Sub-plot(s)
1.  Set up the Battlefield
1.  Choose Crews
1.  Announce Resource Bonuses
1.  Tactics Cards (specified by scenario)
1.  Deployment (specified by scenario or default)

## 1. Make a Challenge

A gang must challenge another gang.

For campaigns with Resources, nominate an eligible Resource as the stake.

If the challenged gang had captured any fighters from the challenger's gang, the captives can be the stake of the battle (instead of any resources).

The challenged gang then accepts or refuses the challenge.

If refused, the challenger automatically gains the stake (Resource or freeing the captives).

#### Uprising

Determine Ascendancy effects before each battle. Roll a D6 and apply the effects for the Allegiance that currently have Ascendancy. Effects apply to all participating gangs.

## 2. Recruit Hired Guns

The underdog starts recruiting Hired Guns (roll-off in case of a tie).

:::tip YAQ
Then re-calculate Gang Rating including Hired Guns.
:::

## 3. Determine Scenario

Roll for scenario. There are 3 options:

- Default: Randomize (depending on scenario) using a scenario table (D6/2D6/D36).
- Hive War (randomly generate a scenario).

An underdog scenario can be selected by the underdog if the difference in Gang Rating is more than 400 and the underdog can choose the scenario.
