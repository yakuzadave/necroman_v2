# Open Hive War

Scenarios can be randomly generated using these ‘Hive War’ rules. The default size for this battlefield is 36”x36”, but smaller and larger battlefields can be used.

The scenario is determined by randomly combining the following components (there are 12 of each):

- Deployment: Where gangs can deploy. Some specify separate zones for attacker & defender. If a gang has multiple separate zones, at least 1 fighter must be placed in each zone (as far as possible).
- Objective: Describes how the battle is won. Some use Objective markers. These are controlled in the End phase by the gang having the most fighters within 2” (not counting Seriously Injured fighters). Objective markers can't be scored in the first round or until the round after the Alarm is raised (Sneak Attack).
- Peril: Special effects that apply to the battle.
- Loot: Side-missions with additional rewards (usually kept secret). Scored immediately when the specified requirements are met.

:::danger House Rule

It could be beneficial to add the following rules universally:

- Sneak Attack
  - No gang can win until after the End phase of the round after the Alarm has been raised.
  - Loot can't be scored until the End phase of the round after the Alarm has been raised.
