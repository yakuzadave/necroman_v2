# Post-battle Sequence

1. **Wrap Up.** Succumbing to injuries, being captured and recovery.
1. **Alignment Checks.** Law & Misrule: check if alignment has changed.
1. **Assign/Reassign Resource.** Claim territories or other resources if appropriate.
1. **Receive Rewards.** Apply Scenario rewards, including reputation.
1. **Collect Income.** Calculate your income for each resource.
1. **Post-battle Actions.** Make trades, visit the Doc and make repairs.
1. **Update Roster.** Apply XP and level up in Yaktribe!

## 1. Wrap Up

Any events that take place ‘at the end of the battle’ are triggered here.

#### Succumbing to Injuries

Seriously Injured fighters (that fled during the battle or remained at the end of the battle) survive without Lasting Injuries on a 3+. On a 1-2, they succumb to their injuries and are treated as having gone Out of Action, suffering a Lasting Injury as normal.

#### Being Captured

If only one gang has fighters left on the battlefield at the end of a battle, roll 2D6 and add the following modifiers:

- +1 per enemy fighter taken Out of Action (including those who succumbed to their injuries).
- +1 per friendly hired Bounty Hunter.
- +1 per webbed enemy fighter that went Out of Action.
- +1 per restrained enemy fighter (Enforcer skill).
- +1 per friendly Water Guild fighter not Out of Action if the Master Nautican (Leader) has not gone Out of Action.

Capture levels:

- **Standard:** 13+
- **Law & Misrule:** 11+

If the result is higher than the capture level, one random fighter that went Out of Action is captured. Critically Injured fighters can't be captured (randomize another fighter).

#### Fighters Recover

Fighters that were in recovery during this battle are now healed and available again.

## 2. Alignment Checks

#### Law & Misrule

Make an Alignment test for each Sub-plot claimed that does not match the gang’s alignment:

Roll a number of D6s specified by the claimed Sub-plot(s). In addition, add a D6 per Law Abiding fighter in the gang that:

- Took part in the battle.
- Equipped with Illegal item(s).

If any D6 rolls a 1, the gang’s actions have caused their alignment to change.

Gangs that can't change alignment lose 5 Reputation instead when failing an alignment test.

:::danger House Rule
Underdog bonuses:

- XP (win/lose)
- Credits - Giant Killer Bonus (win)
  Other:
- Income tax
- Steal/Destroy Resource (win)

:::

## 3. Assign/Reassign Resource

#### Dominion and Law & Misrule

The winner claims the Resource. In case of a draw, the Resource is not assigned/reassigned.

#### Uprising

If the winning gang inflicted 3x as many Out of Action results as was suffered (not counting fighters that escaped or fled), capture a random (non-permanent) Resource from the opponent (if they have any remaining).

:::danger House Rule (A&A)

Scenario Rewards are capped at 4D6x10 Credits.

:::

## 4. Receive Rewards

Receive rewards according to the scenario.

#### Claiming Scrap (Wrecked Vehicles)

If only one gang remained on the battlefield, gain D3x10 credits per wrecked enemy vehicle (the vehicles are then reclaimed by their owners).

**Outlanders:** Build Structures (after receiving rewards).

#### Gaining and Losing Reputation

Reputation can be modified in a number of ways. Apply gains before losses (Reputation can't go below 1).

## 5. Collect Income

Collect income from each Resource including any just gained.

- **Dominion:** After each battle.
- **Law & Misrule:** After each battle.
- **Uprising:** After the first battle in each cycle.

## 6. Post-Battle Actions

Each Leader or Champion can make one post-battle action each (except if In Recovery, Captured or dead etc.):

- Trade (2 types):
  - Regular Trade (Trading Post)
  - Black Market Trade (Black Market)
- Escort critically injured fighter to the Doc (costs 2D6x10 credits per action).
- Negotiate Repairs (cost varies).
- Uprising:
  - Scavenging (phase 3)

In addition, the gang can make the following actions any number of times:

- Handle Captives:
  - Dominion
    - Sell
    - Trade
  - Law & Misrule
    - Claim Bounties
    - Trade
    - Dispose
  - Uprising
    - Dispose
    - Trade
    - Phase 3: +1 Meat portion.
- Visit the Trading Post

### Choose a Trade Action

Each eligible fighter can make one trade action each. These are chosen individually per fighter:

- Trading Post & Black Market: Rare items.
- Black Market Trade: Illegal items.

Depending on Alignment, fighters may need to take a test for the trade action.

#### Rare Items (Trading Post & Black Market)

**Law Abiding:** Automatically pass test.

**Outlaw:** Pass a Cool test.

#### Illegal Items (Black Market)

**Law Abiding:** Pass an Intelligence test.

**Outlaw:** Automatically pass test

#### Trading

The gang can make 2 separate rolls (one for Rare items and one for Illegal items).

- Rare items availability: 2D6
- Illegal items availability: 2D6.

Finally, add any modifiers to the roll if any fighters made trade actions. The gang can now buy any number of items with an availability level equal to or lower than the roll (after applying modifiers).

:::info Rarity Rolls

A large selection of items for sale are rare. These are represented with an availability rating, such as Rare 9.

To determine if you can purcahse rare items, roll 2D6 and add any modifiers from the below chart.

For example, if checking against the Trading post and you rolled a 4 (1, 3), sent 1 leader and 1 champion, and had a reputation of 12, you would have a Rarity roll of 8 `4(2D6 roll) + 2(Leader) + 1(Champion) + 1(Reputation) = 8`.

:::

#### Trade in the Wasteland

Wasteland gangs have a less constrained view of either being an Outlaw or Law Abiding, with the line between the two blurred at best.

If vehicles & mounts are used in the campaign, the penalties for seeking Rare/Illegal equipment are reduced by 1.

#### Visiting the Trading Post

- Hire fighters, crew, vehicles & vehicle upgrades (according to Gang Composition). Note that all crew must end up being assigned to a vehicle (vehicles can however be replaced or swapped).
- Recruit Hangers-on (according to Reputation limit)
- Sell Equipment (value - D6x10, minimum 5).
- Sell damaged vehicles (25% of value):<br />Vehicles with at least one Lasting Damage can be scrapped for 25% of the cost (rounding up to the nearest 5 credits):
  - Including Upgrades (lost).
  - Not including Wargear and weapons (returned to Stash).

Purchase equipment from:

- Gang equipment list.
- Trading Post.
- Black Market.

**Uprising:** Trading Post & Black Market are not available.

## 7. Update Roster

#### Buy Advancements

Fighters can [spend XP to buy Advancements](/docs/old-campaigns/experience#experience-table).

#### Update Roster

- Delete dead fighters
- Sell damaged vehicles
- Retire fighters & crew

Dead fighters and vehicle crew are permanently lost. The equipment (except armour) is added to the Stash if any of the following is true:

- At least 1 friendly model was on the battlefield at the end of the battle.
- The fighter was taken to the Doc but still died (even if the Doc wasn’t paid).

Otherwise, the dead fighter’s equipment is lost.

Any fighters or vehicle crew can be retired and their equipment is added to the Stash. Vehicles without crew is returned to the Stash (and can be given to a new crew).

#### Gain Bonuses From Resources and Reputation

Some Resources grant additional bonuses (recruits, Hangers-on or equipment).

#### Update Gang Roster

After all changes are made, update the Gang Rating. Note that any other references to the Gang Rating in the post-battle sequence are referring to the value before it is updated.
