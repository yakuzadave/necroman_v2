# Outcast Scenarios

Life in the outlands can be even more brutal and fleeting than the rest of the
underhive, and Outcasts gangs must work hard for everything they need to survive.

This often means going on dangerous prospecting or scavenging missions out into the wilds looking for anything they can use to fortify or improve their hideout, or even just to find the simplest of resources like food and water.

Once an Outcasts gang has built its settlement it then needs to be defended. This can be against rival gangs, the various horrors of the underhive or even the settlement itself – many fledgling badzone towns are destroyed from within by the greed or recklessness of their residents.

Should the gang survive long enough to stake a permanent claim to the outlands, they can then turn from prey into predator, and launch their own attacks and raids against nearby territories, either taking resources to make their own settlement larger and more powerful, or even taking over an enemy’s town altogether, and growing their
burgeoning underhive empire.

[Outcast Scenarios](/docs/tags/outcast-scenario) are designed for Outcasts gangs and gangs fighting in the outlands. These have been created both with Outcasts gangs in mind, but also for use with the [Outlander Campaign](/docs/campaigns/outlander-campaign/). They include resource gathering scenarios such as [Gunk Tank](/docs/scenarios/scenario-list/gunk-tank), where the gang must siphon off valuable gunk before their enemies do, [Mining Expedition](http://localhost:3000/docs/scenarios/scenario-list/mining-expedition), detailing a gang’s prospecting efforts out in the badzones, and [The Big Score](/docs/scenarios/scenario-list/the-big-score), where a gang goes all in for a single large payday.

Complementing these resource-focused scenarios are ones centred on attacking and defending underhive settlements. [Settlement Raid](/docs/scenarios/scenario-list/settlement-raid) is the classic assault on a settlement as one gang tries to bring down another's town, while [Stealth Attack](/docs/scenarios/scenario-list/stealth-attack) offers sneaky gangs a unique way to do some damage to their rivals. Finally, [Market Mayhem](/docs/scenarios/scenario-list/market-mayhem) is all about fighting inside the settlement itself, either against malcontents or enemies in a parlay gone wrong.

## Featured Terrain and Resources

Many of the scenarios presented here make use of specific terrain features,
such as settlement walls, gunk tanks or market stalls. These pieces of terrain come with their own set of rules governing how fighters interact with them and their overall effect on the battlefield.

Players can either represent them with the corresponding Citadel miniatures, such as those from the Gang Stronghold set or the Underhive Market set, or create their own terrain pieces using the rules as a guideline for their size and function. In either case, when a scenario calls for a specific terrain feature to be present, it is important that both players clearly define the terrain before the battle begins.

In addition to the inclusion of unique terrain features, many of the Outcast
scenarios also include rewards keyed to the Outlander Campaign, namely Power,
Sustenance and Salvage. These are the resources a gang will use to build
and grow their underhive settlement, and are vital to victory in the campaign.

If players are using these scenarios outside of the Outlander Campaign then these campaign-specific rewards can be ignored, and only the standard scenario rewards – as listed in each scenario – are used.
