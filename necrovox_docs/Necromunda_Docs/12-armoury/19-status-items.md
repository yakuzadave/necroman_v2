# Status Items

_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

Exotic Beasts, stolen relics or flamboyant opulence, when the money starts rolling
in, underhive gangers are notorious for their tendency to flash their cash, spending
it on all manner of extravagances that leave others in no doubt as to their success
and importance, not only within their own gang, but within their House and the
wider underhive. Unfortunately, such gaudy displays of wealth often leave others
questioning the ganger’s sense of style, and in extreme cases, their gullibility!

## Extravagant Goods

Representing the fruits of a successful career, Extravagant Goods are only available
to fighters with the Gang Hierarchy (X) special rule, to Gang Leaders or to Champions.

### Exotic Furs

**50 Credits – Rare (12)**  
_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

_Many gangers excel at the hunt for rare and exotic goods, building up a network of trusted suppliers and contacts. They often have ready personal access to a wealth of rare off-world trade and they delight in flaunting their status through the wearing of many strange items._

Should this fighter make a Trade action in the
post-battle sequence, they add an additional +1 modifier to the dice roll to determine
the Availability Level.

### Gold-Plated Gun

**40 Credits – Rare (10)**  
_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

_Gang fighters take tremendous pride in their weapons, they are the tools of their trade and a clear badge of office, and a finely crafted piece is a possession to treasure. Over time, successful members of a gang’s hierarchy are likely to expend considerable sums on upgrading and improving their weapons, and for those gangers who want a clear and public statement that such craftsmanship has been undertaken, nothing beats the gaudiness of having the entire weapon plated in gold._

Any ranged weapon can be gold-plated. A fighter with a gold-plated gun improves
their Leadership characteristic by 1. Additionally, once per battle, the fighter may
re-roll a failed Ammo test.

### Master-Crafted Weapon

**\* Credits – Rare (10)**  
_\*25% of the cost of the weapon, rounded up to the nearest 5 credits_  
_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

_The fighter purchases a new weapon of exceptional craftsmanship._

Any weapon may be master-crafted (note that grenades are Wargear, not weapons). The cost of a master-crafted weapon is that of the weapon plus 25%, with fractions rounded up to the nearest 5 credits. For example, a master-crafted bolter/ plasma combi-weapon would cost 145 credits (115 credits plus 25% equals 143.75 credits. Rounded up to the nearest 5 credits, this weapon costs 145 credits).

Note that the fighter may replace a weapon with
which they are already equipped with a master-crafted
version of that weapon, and that the original may be
discarded and added to the gang’s Stash. This is an
exception to the norm.

A master-crafted weapon is a normal weapon of its
type that gains the Master-crafted trait.

### Opulent Jewellery

**80 Credits – Rare (11)**  
_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

_As wealth increases, gangers find themselves able to attain items that other dwellers of the underhive could never afford. They are attracted to the glitter and glimmer of fine jewellery like sheen birds to a heat sink. Many Guilders make a pretty profit selling gaudy, low quality junk to gangers eager to prove that they too have the wealth of the uphive gentry, and it is interesting to note that many gangers believe the purest gold turns the skin green._

If this fighter makes
a Medical Escort action in the post-battle sequence, they will attempt to impress the Doc with their visible
wealth. Sometimes this works, sometimes it does not…
The player may re-roll the dice when determining the
fee the Doc charges, but must accept the second
result, even if it is worse.

### Uphive Raiments

**50 Credits – Rare (10)**  
_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

_The styles and fashions of uphive folk are rarely seen first-hand in the underhive and yet they still have a huge influence on the denizens of the lower hab levels, those who toil in the manufactoria and grease the gears of Imperial industry with their blood and sweat, for they will see flashes of how the uphivers dress on news reels on their pict viewers. Gang leaders, however, often possess the wealth to acquire such fabulous goods, and they have no hesitation in flaunting their new-found chic._

If this fighter is not
In Recovery during the post-battle sequence, their
gang gains an extra D3x10 credits during the Collect
Income step.

## Servo-skulls

_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

The manufacture of servo-skulls is common across the Imperium, yet they
remain incredibly rare artefacts normally only found in the company of nobility, priests, military or naval officers, or even in the service of Rogue Traders and
Inquisitors. Most commonly they are made from the skulls of the most devout of the
Emperor’s servants, their duty continuing beyond death. Yet they do appear in the
underhive, occasionally coming up for sale offered by a Guilder or trader unwilling
to speak about their provenance, or, more rarely still, as antiques of certain houses, artefacts of a famous gang noble from history perhaps.

Servo-skulls are only available to fighters with the Gang Hierarchy (X) special rule, to Gang Leaders or to Champions. All servo-skulls are treated as ordinary Wargear
and should be recorded on their owner’s Fighter card accordingly. Servo-skulls follow these rules:

- Servo-skulls must be represented by a separate model that must stay within 2"
  of the owning fighter. This is not a fighter; it is purely a marker representing the
  servo-skull and matters only for its own line of sight and targeting purposes. Nor
  will they give away their owner’s location, as they are assumed to be aware enough
  of stealthy movement to emulate it, and remain very low and close when needed.
- When the owner activates, the servo-skull will move with them. Servo-skulls ignore
  all terrain other than impassable terrain or walls, and can never fall.
- Servo-skulls cannot be targeted by shooting or melee attacks, and can never be
  engaged in combat – they simply float away.
- Servo-skulls may be caught by a Blast marker or Flame template. If a servo-skull
  is caught under a Blast marker or Flame template, the attacker rolls a D6. On a
  4-6, it is hit by the attack. On a 1-3, it is able to float clear of the area of the attack. Leave the model where it is and assume it has bobbed around to avoid the attack
  and returned to where it was. If a servo-skull is hit in this way, the owning player
  rolls a D6. On a 1, it is destroyed and should be removed from the owning fighter’s
  Fighter card. On a 2-6, it is taken Out of Action and plays no further part in the
  battle, but otherwise suffers no long-term effects.
- If the owning fighter leaves the battlefield for any reason, the servo-skull will
  accompany them and takes no further part in the battle.

### Sensor Skull

**60 Credits – Rare (12)**  
_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

A sensor skull grants the owning fighter the same benefits as a [bio-scanner](/docs/armoury/personal-equipment#bio-scanner). In addition, when the fighter takes an Aim (Basic) action, they may add 2 to the result of any hit rolls they make for subsequent shots
taken in the same activation rather than the usual 1. This bonus is in addition to any granted by any other
Wargear or skills the fighter may have.

### Medi Skull

**80 Credits – Rare (12)**  
_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

When making a Recovery test for the owning fighter, roll an extra Injury dice, then choose one of the dice
to resolve and discard the other. This is in addition
to any friendly fighters assisting the recovery and any
other items such as medicae kits, so it is possible that
the owning fighter may be rolling several Injury dice to
choose from.

### Gun Skull

**65 Credits – Rare (12)**  
_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

A gun skull is equipped with a compact autopistol
and will target whatever or whoever the owning fighter
does when they make a ranged attack. Simply roll
one extra hit dice and one extra Ammo dice for the
gun skull, ideally of a different colour to those being
used for the fighter, to represent the gun skull making
a ranged attack. Note though that range, line of sight
and cover must be worked out from the gun skull itself
rather than that of the owning fighter. If the owning
fighter does not possess any ranged weapons, the gun
skull may shoot at an enemy it can see, chosen by the
owning fighter and following the normal target priority
rules in relation to the owning fighter’s position.

The owning fighter is never considered to be in the way
of a gun skull’s shooting attacks and cannot be hit by
stray shots.

A gun skull has a BS of 5+, and may never benefit fromaiming or any Wargear or skills that modify the owning
fighter’s hit rolls.

## Exotic Beasts

<FighterCard cost="0*">

### 0-1 Caryatid

**AL:** Rare (15)  
Available to any Gang Leader.

_Caryatids are small, blue, winged humanoid creatures which infest the air ducts and vents throughout Necromunda’s many hives. Mildly psychic, they are particularly attracted to the soon-to-become-powerful, and are seen as good luck charms by the majority of hivers. However, an individual whose ‘pet’ Caryatid leaves them is regarded as waiting for death, for just as their arrival is considered a good omen, their departure is an omen of doom._

|  M  | WS  | BS  |  S  |  T  |  W  |  I  |  A  | Ld  | Cl  | Wil | Int |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 6"  | 5+  |  -  |  2  |  2  |  1  | 2+  |  1  | 7+  | 7+  | 8+  | 8+  |

**Weapons:** None (always make unarmed attacks).

#### Special Rules

**Omen of Fortune:** A Caryatid is able to sense bad
fortune and forewarn its chosen companion, giving
them a flash of precognition. Whilst the Caryatid is within 3" of its companion, that
fighter may avoid one successful hit per turn by making
a successful Willpower test. Make the test immediately
after a successful roll to hit has been made against the
fighter. If the test is failed, the attack hits as normal.
If the test is passed, the attack counts as having
missed and the dice roll is discarded. Templates and
Blast markers are placed as normal for the purposes
of determining hits against other models, but the
Caryatid’s companion is assumed to have somehow
dodged clear.

**Precognition:** The gift of foresight possessed by the
Caryatid enables it to dodge and evade all but the most
unexpected of attacks. This tremendous precognition
grants the Caryatid a 3+ save roll, which cannot be
modified by Armour Piercing.

Additionally, a Caryatid may avoid being caught by a
Blast marker or Flame template. If a Caryatid is caught
under a Blast marker or Flame template, the attacker
should roll a D6. On a 4-6, the Caryatid is hit by the
attack. On a 1-3, the Caryatid is able to fly clear of the
area of the attack. Leave the model where it is and
assume that it has fluttered around to avoid the attack
and returned to where it was.

**Symbol of Renown:** So long as a gang Leader is
accompanied by a Caryatid, that gang’s Reputation is
increased by +1. However, should the Caryatid ever be
killed, or should it ever abandon its companion, the
gang’s Reputation will be reduced by -2.

**Abandonment:** Should the gang reduce its Reputation
for any reason, roll a D6 and subtract the number of
Reputation lost from the result. If the total is 1 or less, the Caryatid will abandon its companion. A natural roll
of a 6 is always a success, regardless of modifiers.

**Flight:** A Caryatid ignores all terrain, may move freely
between levels without restriction, and can never fall.
It may not, however, ignore impassable terrain and
may not end its movement with its base overlapping an
obstacle or another fighter’s base.

**\*Lucky Find:** A Caryatid is not purchased like other
items of Wargear, instead one may decide of its own
volition to make a companion of a gang leader or not.
Should the gang roll 15 or higher after modifiers for the
Availability level as part of a Trade post-battle action, there is a chance that a Caryatid will attach itself to
the gang Leader. Roll 2D6 and add the gang’s current
Reputation. If the result is 20 or higher, a Caryatid has
decided to form a bond with the gang Leader.

#### Special Rules

**Flight:** A Grapplehawk ignores all terrain, may move freely between levels without
restriction, and can never fall. It may not, however, ignore impassable terrain
and may not end its movement with its base overlapping an obstacle or another
fighter’s base.

**Grapple:** If a Grapplehawk successfully hits a fighter with its Talons, it does not need
to roll to hit that fighter again in subsequent activations or with Reaction attacks. Furthermore, these subsequent attacks count as having rolled a 6 to hit for the
purposes of the [Disarm](/docs/gang-fighters-and-their-weaponry/skills/#3-disarm) and Entangle Traits.

**Swoop:** Grapplehawks can range further from their owners than most Exotic Beasts. A Grapplehawk must remain within 9" of its owner rather than 3".

### 0-1 Gyrinx Cat

**AL:** Illegal (14)  
Available to any Gang Leader or Champion.

_Psychic xenos pets such as the Gyrinx Cat are heavily restricted on Necromunda, with only the most powerful and influential nobles able to acquire and keep them. Of course, sometimes they escape and find their way into the hands of less salubrious individuals._

#### Special Rules

**Small Target:** Gyrinx Cats are small, nimble and hard to target. Ranged attacks against Gyrinx Cats are made at -1 to hit. In addition, a Gyrinx Cat is never a potential
target when working out the effects of a Stray Shot.

**Charmed:** Gyrinx Cats live charmed lives and cannot be targeted by ranged attacks
unless they are the closest target. In addition, Gyrinx Cats can only be the target of
melee attacks if there are no other enemies engaged with the attacker.

**Psyker:** Gyrinx Cats are psykers and follow all the [rules for psykers](/docs/the-rules/psykers) and using psychic powers. At the start of each game, randomly determine a psychic power for the Gyrinx Cat from the [universal Wyrd Powers table](/docs/the-rules/psykers#wyrd-powers).

result is a 1, the Hacked Cyber-mastiff gains the Insane condition.

**Tenacious:** Cyber-mastiffs are renowned for their tenacity. If the Hacked Cyber- mastiff is taken Out of Action, do not remove it from the board if it has not yet

#### Special Rules

**Small Target:** Necromundan Giant Rats are quick, making them difficult to target in
the perpetual gloom of the underhive. Ranged attacks against Necromundan Giant
Rats are made at -1 to hit. In addition, a Necromundan Giant Rat is never a potential
target when working out the effects of a Stray Shot.

**Nimble:** Necromundan Giant Rats have almost preternatural reflexes, seemingly
sensing danger before they strike. A Necromundan Giant Rat has a save of 4+, which
is never modified by Armour Penetration.

**Rat Cunning:** Rats are among the most resilient organisms on Necromunda, and
they have a sixth sense when it comes to their environment. A canny fighter learns
how to read the mood of their rats and react to danger accordingly. A fighter with
at least one Necromundan Giant Rat gains a special 5+ save against damage from
environmental effects. Take this save before any other kind of save. Alternatively, a fighter may sacrifice one of their rats to completely ignore damage from an
environmental effect. The Necromundan Giant Rat is then removed from the
gang’s roster.
