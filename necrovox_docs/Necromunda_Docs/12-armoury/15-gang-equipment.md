# Gang Equipment

Be it extra stashes of ammo, booby traps to guard their territory, or strange robotic sentinels to act as bodyguards and sentries, gangs employ many types of equipment. This section covers just a few.

### Ammo Cache

**60 Credits – Rare (8)**

Ammo caches are added to the gang’s Stash, instead
of being carried by a particular fighter. Immediately
after the last of the fighters in the crew is set up at
the start of a battle, the controlling player can choose
to set up any ammo caches from their Stash. If the
scenario has an attacker and a defender, and this gang
is defending, roll a D6 for each of their ammo caches:

- On a 1-4, they were not expecting the attackers and the caches cannot be used.
- On a 5 or 6, they are lucky enough to have them to hand.

Each ammo cache must be set up within 1" of one
of their fighters, and within their deployment zone
if the scenario has one. It is then deleted from the
gang’s Stash. During the battle, ammo caches follow the rules given in [Scenario Rules: Ammo Cache](/docs/battlefield-setup/scenario-rules#ammo-cache).

### Booby Traps (Frag, Gas & Melta)

**Frag – 20 Credits**  
**Gas – 40 Credits – Rare (8)**

A booby trap is represented by a marker placed upon
the battlefield at the start of the battle, after the
battlefield has been set up but before deploying any
fighters. If both gangs possess and wish to use booby
traps, the defender or the winner of a roll-off (if there is
no defender) places theirs first.

If any model, friendly or enemy, comes within 2" of a
booby trap for any reason, they risk setting the booby
trap off. Roll a D6. On a 1, the booby trap is a dud
and is removed from the battlefield. On a 2 or 3, the
booby trap does not go off but is left in place. On a 4, 5 or 6, the booby trap is triggered and will explode. The profiles for booby traps can be found in [Armoury: Booby Traps](/docs/armoury/booby-traps). The movement of a moving model is interrupted
whilst this roll is resolved. If the booby trap does not
go off, their movement continues after the roll is
made. If the booby trap does go off, and the model is
Pinned, Injured, Wrecked or Stalled as a result, their
movement ends.

Any model can target a booby trap with ranged attacks. Doing so has a -1 modifier to the hit roll at Short range, or a -2 modifier at Long range. If the booby trap is hit,
roll a D6:

- On a 1-2, it is unaffected.
- On a 3-4, it is immediately triggered.
- On a 5-6, it is disarmed and removed.

### Isotropic Fuel Rod

Power is life down in the underhive, keeping the lights
on, running water stills and allowing for the cultivation
of edible slimes. A fully charged fuel rod can turn a
rad-washed waste into a fertile settlement, and the
foundation for a burgeoning community.

A gang with an Isotropic Fuel Rod can use it to turn any
Territory into a Settlement Territory. Doing so uses up
the Isotropic Fuel Rod, so it should be deleted from the
gang roster, and permanently changes the Territory.

### Mung Vase

**2d6x10 Credits – Rare (12)**

_Mung vases are extraordinarily rare collectors objects. Few hivers know where the exquisite vases originate, only that they can be worth astronomical sums of money to the right people. This knowledge is widespread enough that over the centuries, Necromunda has become flooded with millions of fake Mung vases, ranging from crudely fashioned knock-offs that wouldn’t fool a blind sump-farmer, to exceptional facsimiles that are works of art in their own right._

A Mung Vase is a type of Status Item. However unlike
other Status Items, rather than being given to a Leader
or Champion to carry, the Mung Vase is kept in the
gang’s Stash. When a gang in possession of a Mung
Vase recruits a Hired Gun, they can reduce the Hire
Gun’s cost by D6x10 credits, to a minimum of 10
credits. The vase is shown off as an example of the
gang’s wealth and success, and the Hired Gun believes
that agreeing to a reduced fee now will earn them
favour with this potentially prosperous employer. There
is, however, a chance the Hired Gun will simply try to
steal the vase when they leave! After a battle in which
a Mung Vase was used to reduce the hiring cost of a
Hired Gun, roll a D6. On a 1, both the Hired Gun and
the vase disappear, never to be seen again.
In the post-battle sequence of any battle, a gang can
sell the vase. If they do, roll a D6 on the Mung Vase
table to see what it is worth (players should resist the
temptation to roll on this table unless their gang is
attempting to sell a Mung Vase – you don’t need to
know your vase is a fake, ignorance is bliss!).

#### Mung Vase Table

| D6  | Type              | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| :-: | :---------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  1  | Dismal Fake       | A truly sad knock-off. The vase nets the gang D3x5 credits.                                                                                                                                   |
| 2-3 | Passable Fake     | A nice conversation piece. The vase nets the gang D6x10 credits.                                                                                                                              |
| 4-5 | Impressive Fake   | A fine example of the counterfeiters’ art. The vase nets the gang D6x20 credits.                                                                                                              |
|  6  | Outstanding Fake? | Make an Intelligence test for the gang Leader. If they fail, count this result as an Impressive Fake. If they pass, they realise what they have just in time – add D6x50 to the gang’s Stash. |

Finally, if the gang Leader is killed and removed fromthe gang roster, the vase is lost too – no one else in
the gang knows where the vase has been kept hidden!
