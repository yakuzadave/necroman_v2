# Chems

## Chem Suppliers
  
_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

Unlike other kinds of illegal items, chems are in ready supply throughout the underhive. Even so, finding a reliable supply of a particular chem can be difficult with the constant competition between Narco Lords, the sanctions of the Guilders and interference by the Palanite Enforcers.

When a gang buys a chem from the Trading Post, they are buying one dose. This means the chem can be used once – as detailed in its description – and then it is gone. After the gang buys a chem, however, make a note that they have found a supplier for that chem. The next time they want to buy the same chemfrom the Trading Post, it counts as not having the Rare (X) or Illegal (X) rule.

However, after buying a chem from a supplier, the gang rolls a D6. On a 1, the supply has run out (or, more likely, the supplier has been killed!) and the next time the gang wishes to buy the chem the Rare (X) or Illegal (X) rule
applies as normal.

When a gang buys a chem, it may buy multiple doses of that chem. These can be distributed
among gang members or placed in the gang’s Stash for future use.

## Side Effects, Duration And Mixing Chems

All chems have ‘side effects’. A chem’s
side effects are detailed under the chem’s
description and are usually detrimental.

Unless otherwise noted, all chems last for the duration of a single battle and can be taken by a fighter either before the battle begins (the fighter beginning the battle under the chem’s effects) or as part of a fighter’s
activation by performing the Use Chem (Simple) action.

Finally, if a fighter takes more than one chemat a time, there is a chance they will have a bad reaction. Each time a fighter takes a chem while under the effects of one or more other chems, roll a D6. If the result is equal to or less than the number of chems the fighter has taken
(counting the chem they just took), the fighter has had
a bad reaction. The fighter immediately goes Out of
Action, though no roll is made on the Lasting Injuries
table, rather they go Into Recovery. If a fighter starts
a battle under the effect of more than one chem then
they must make this check as soon as they activate.

## List of Chems

### Frenzon

**20 Credits – Rare (9)**  
_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

_Frenzon is a mix of Stimm, Spur, ’Slaught and other combat drugs. The resulting chem turns users into savage killers, intent only upon murdering those in their path. Primarily, Frenzon is used on penal legions or indentured slave troops, both as a means of control and a way to drive soldiers at the enemy with little regard for their own lives. Some gang leaders use it in this way on disposable gangers and juves, though some fighters get a taste for the chem and take it willingly before battle._

A fighter under the influence of Frenzon gains the
Nerves of Steel, [True Grit](/docs/gang-fighters-and-their-weaponry/skills/#5-true-grit), [Unstoppable](/docs/gang-fighters-and-their-weaponry/skills/#6-unstoppable) and Berserk.
skills, however, all their weapons count as having
the Reckless trait. Unless the fighter is Standing
and Engaged or Prone and Seriously Injured, the
fighter must use at least one of their actions to move
toward the nearest enemy fighter or perform a Charge
(Double) action against a visible enemy if one is
within range.

#### Side Effects

Frenzon is highly addictive. During the Wrap-up, any
fighter who used Frenzon must make a Toughness
check, adding 2 to the dice roll. If the check is failed, the fighter has become addicted to Frenzon. Once
a fighter is addicted to Frenzon, they can only be
included in a crew if they have taken a dose of the
chem. The only way a fighter can shake this addiction
is to pay 2D6x10 credits for anti-addiction chems
during the post-battle sequence when the gang is
buying equipment.

### Ghast

**30 Credits – Illegal (9)**  
_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

_Ghast enhances any latent psychic awareness in the human mind. Ghast-induced psykers lack any real mental strength, though for a brief time they are able to exhibit a single ability, albeit without any great skill. This reason alone is enough to make it a popular chem among the denizens of the underhive._

When a fighter uses Ghast, they roll a D6. On a 1, they become subject to the Insane condition. On a 2-5, they gain a random psychic power from the [Wyrd Powers table](/docs/the-rules/psykers#wyrd-powers). On a 6, they both gain a random psychic power and become subject to the Insane condition.

#### Side Effects

At the end of any battle in which a fighter used Ghast,
they must make a Willpower test. If the test is failed, the fighter suffers a decrease of 1 to their Willpower
(i.e., if the fighter’s Willpower is 7+, it becomes 8+).
If a natural 12 is rolled for the test, the fighter’s mind is
permanently damaged and they must begin any future
battles subject to the Insane condition.

### Icrotic Slime

**35 Credits – Rare (10)**  
_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

_This is a rare and dangerous underhive organism – a living, transparent blob about the size of a human fist. The slime preys upon sleeping or helpless creatures, eating their brains, but giving them a euphoric high as it does so. So great is this high that some fighters let the slime latch onto their head before battle, riding the high and hoping they can scrape it off before it kills them._

When a fighter uses Icrotic Slime, make a
Characteristic check for their Movement, Strength, Toughness, Initiative, Attacks and Cool characteristics. For each check that is passed, improve that
characteristic by D3.

#### Side Effects

Whilst under the effects of Icrotic Slime, the
fighter’s Leadership, Intelligence and Willpower are
decreased to 10+ (unless these characteristics are
already worse than this). At the end of any battle in
which a fighter used Icrotic Slime, roll 2D6 for that
fighter. On a roll of 2, the slime eats the fighter’s
brain and they are killed. Immediately remove them
from the gang’s roster. On a roll of 3-11, the slime is
successfully removed but the fighter is placed Into
Recovery. On a roll of 12, the slime is successfully
removed but not without complications. Make a roll on
the Lasting Injury table against the fighter, re-rolling
results of Bitter Enmity, Captured, Critical Injury and
Memorable Death.

### Kalma

**15 Credits**  
_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

_Kalma is the hive name for a general group of euphoric sedatives which lower the state of consciousness and induce a state of wellbeing. Kalma is sometimes used to sedate prisoners so that they can be led away quickly and easily by Enforcers._

In addition to other methods of use, a gang can give
Kalma to a fighter they hold captive during the Rescue
scenario. When a fighter affected by Kalma wishes
to make an action, roll 2D6 for them and add their
Toughness. On a roll of 11 or lower, they do nothing
and the action is wasted. On a roll of 12 or more, they
shake off the effects of the chem and can act normally
for the remainder of the battle.

#### Side Effects

There are no long term effects from taking Kalma.

### Obscura

**30 Credits – Illegal (8)**  
_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

_A recreational narcotic used from the Noble Hedonistia of the spire to the chem dens of the underhive, Obscura sends its users into a dream-like state in which reality melts away around them. This high is followed by a period of crushing depression, alleviated only by the taking of more Obscura. In addition to other methods of use, a gang can give Obscura to a fighter they hold captive during the Rescue scenario. A fighter under the influence of Obscura changes their Movement characteristic to D6" and all their weapons count as having the Reckless trait._

Note that when they move, a fighter under the
influence of Obscura must move the full distance rolled
in a straight line, even if this would take them into
base contact with an enemy fighter, in which case they
will engage that enemy fighter, or over the edge of a
ledge. Fighters under the influence of Obscura must
still respect the 1" rule – if they cannot get into base
contact with an enemy fighter when moving, they must
stop 1" away.

In the End phase of each round a fighter affected by
Obscura may, if their controlling player wishes, roll 2D6
and add their Toughness. If the result is 12 or more, they shake off the effects of the chem.

#### Side Effects

When a dose of Obscura wears off, the fighter enters
a deep melancholy and they may only perform a single
action in each of their activations for the remainder of
the battle.

During the Wrap-up, any fighter who used Obscura
must make a Toughness check. If the check is failed, the fighter has become addicted to Obscura. Once
a fighter is addicted to Obscura, they can only be
included in a crew on a D6 roll of a 4+ prior to the
battle. The only way a fighter can shake this addiction
is to pay 2D6x10 credits for anti-addiction chems
during the post-battle sequence when the gang is
buying equipment.

### ’Slaught

**30 Credits – Rare (10)**  
_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

_’Slaught, officially known as Onslaught, is a crude combat drug made from a dangerous combination of amphetamines and mutant rat adrenal glands. ’Slaught enhances an individual’s fighting abilities; increasing alertness and speed by slowing down a person’s perception of the world around them._

A fighter affected by ’Slaught increases their Weapon Skill and Initiative to 2+ and adds 1 to their Attacks characteristic.

#### Side Effects

During the Wrap-up, any fighter who used ’Slaught
must make a Toughness check. If the check is failed, the fighter has become addicted to ’Slaught. In each
future battle the fighter takes part in, if they do not
take a dose of ’Slaught, they must decrease their
Weapon Skill and Initiative to 5+, and their Attacks to
1 (unless these characteristics are already worse than
this). If they take a dose, the effects are reduced and
their Weapon Skill and Initiative become 3+ and they
gain no bonus to their Attacks characteristics. A fighter
can shake their addiction to ’Slaught by voluntarily
going into Recovery during any post-battle sequence.

### Spur

**35 Credits – Rare (11)**  
_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

_The name Spur is given to a number of similar stimulants, all of which boost the nervous system, improving the senses, muscle reaction and speed of thought. However, the chem’s effects are short lived and wear off quickly, often after only a few minutes, half an hour at most._

A fighter affected by Spur increases their Movement
characteristic by 2 and improves their Initiative
characteristic to 2+.

#### Side Effects

Once a fighter has taken a dose of Spur, they must
check to see if it wears off in each subsequent
End phase. Roll 2D6 for the fighter and add their
Toughness. If the result is 10 or more, the Spur has
worn off and the fighter is no longer subject to
its effects.

### Stinger Mould

**75 Credits – Rare (13)**  
_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

_Stinger mould is a rare and precious fungi that grows in isolated patches out in the badzones. The recuperative effects of stinger mould are renowned amongst chirurgeons and doctors, and it is heavily harvested in some areas for use in the hive, the spire and even off-world._

A dose of Stinger Mould can be used after a fighter has
rolled on the Lasting Injury table. If the result of the roll
was anything other than a 66 – Memorable Death, the
result is ignored (including positive results such as 11
– Lesson Learned) and the fighter is instead Out Cold.

Alternatively, a fighter can attempt to use a dose of
Stinger Mould to remove an existing Lasting Injury. During Step 6 of the post-battle sequence, after
distributing equipment but before updating the gang
roster, roll a D6 for any fighter attempting to use
Stinger Mould in this way. On a 5 or 6, the effects
of one Lasting Injury the fighter has suffered are
immediately negated.

#### Side Effects

There are no long term effects of taking Stinger Mould
