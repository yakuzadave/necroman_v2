# Bionics

_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

Bionics are a way to repair damage sustained by fighters as a result of violence and hardship. Not only can
Lasting Injuries be negated through the vigorous application of bionics, but the chances of suffering similar
injuries in the future can be greatly reduced.

## Mundane Bionics

Should a fighter suffer any Lasting Injury as a result of
going Out of Action which permanently reduces one or
more of their characteristics, the injured body part may
be replaced with a bionic prosthesis, thus restoring
some degree of lost function. The price of getting a Doc
to install the bionic is included in its cost. All Mundane
bionics will increase one of the characteristics listed in
their description by +1, thus negating part or all of the
effect of the Lasting Injury.

**Multiple Characteristics:** Players should note that
some Lasting Injuries only cause one characteristic to
be decreased whilst other Lasting Injuries cause two
characteristics to be decreased. Where a Lasting Injury
causes two characteristics to be decreased, the bionic
will give a choice of which characteristic is improved.
If a fighter wishes to rectify two characteristic
decreases caused by a Lasting Injury, they should look
at purchasing an Improved bionic (as follows). They
cannot purchase two Mundane bionics in order to
rectify the effects of a single Lasting Injury.

## Improved Bionics

As with Mundane bionics, any fighter that has suffered
a Lasting Injury as a result of going Out of Action which
permanently reduces two of their characteristics may
replace the injured body part with Improved bionics.
Improved bionics may be bought from the Trading
Post in the same way as other items, provided that
their Availability level has been met. The price of
getting a Doc to install the bionic is included in its
cost. All Improved bionics exist to allow a fighter that
has suffered a Lasting Injury that decreases two
characteristics to increase both at the same time, for
a higher cost. Consequently, Lasting Injuries that only
cause one characteristic to be decreased do not have
the Improved bionics option.

**Characteristic Increases & Bionics:** If a characteristic
has been increased since the injury was sustained as
a result of any Advancements, any bionics purchased
(Mundane and Improved) may still increase the
characteristic by 1 but may not take any characteristics
beyond the maximum characteristics.

**Bionics & Recovery:** If a fighter is In Recovery when
bionics are purchased, they will remain In Recovery as
described in the campaign rules. Purchasing bionics
does not negate the need to recover from an injury, even if the bionics mitigate the long-term effects.

## Damaged Bionics

When a fighter takes a fresh Lasting Injury to a location
previously injured and subsequently replaced with
bionics, there is a chance that their bionics will save
them from further harm, taking only minor damage that
can easily be repaired. Roll a D6. On a 1-3, the Lasting
Injury is applied as normal (perhaps a fighter with a
bionic left leg has sustained a similar injury to their
right leg, for example). On a 4+, the bionics are hit and
the effects of the Lasting Injury are ignored. However, if
hit, there is a chance that the bionics will be irreparably
damaged. Roll a D6. On a 2+, the bionics are scratched
and dented but suffer no long-term effects. On a 1, however, the bionics are damaged beyond repair, the effects of the Lasting Injury are applied and the
previous benefits of the bionics are lost, meaning that
any characteristic increases granted by the bionics are
also lost.
