    "description": "In Necromunda, each player controls a ‘gang’, which is made up of a number of models. Each of these models is referred to as a ‘fighter’ or ‘vehicle’ within the rules. Each model available to a gang is of a named type; this is the name given to that model’s rank within the hierarchy of their gang and the parlance of Necromunda: Leader, Ganger, Underhive Scum, Brute and so forth – but the term ‘fighter’, ‘vehicle’ or ‘model’ covers them all within the rules."
