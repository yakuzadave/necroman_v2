# Skills

_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

This section presents the full list of universal skills available to models. This section is split into nine lists, one for each Skill Set. Each entry lists the skill by name, and then its rules. Note that crew can only gain skills from the Driving, Leadership, Shooting and Savant sets.

:::note

### Universal Skills and Gang Specific Skills

A number of gangs also their own unique set of skills that they have access to. These are listed in [Gang-Specific Skills](/docs/gang-fighters-and-their-weaponry/skills/gang-specific-skills).

:::

The following two tables summarise each of the Skill Sets, and can be used (by rolling a D6) to determine a
random skill from one of the Skill Sets:

| D6  |                                   Agility                                   |                                       Brawn                                       |                                      Combat                                      |                                     Cunning                                     |                                       Driving                                       |

## Agility

### 1. Catfall

When this fighter falls or jumps down from a ledge, they count the vertical distance moved as being half
of what it actually is, rounded up. In addition, if they
are not Prone and Seriously Injured or taken Out of
Action by a fall, make an Initiative test for them – if it is
passed, they remain Standing rather than being Prone
and Pinned.

:::danger Optional House Rule
When falling into a pitfall, mark the closest edge. At the end of that round, place the fighter next to the pitfall on a 4+.
:::

### 2. Clamber

When this fighter climbs, the distance they move is not
halved. In other words, they always count as climbing
up or down a ladder.

:::danger Optional House Rule
Move freely through ductways without spending a Crawl Through (Double) action.
:::

### 3. Dodge

If this fighter suffers a wound from a ranged or close
combat attack, roll a D6. On a 6, the attack is dodged
and has no further effect; otherwise, continue to make
a save or resolve the wound as normal. If the model
dodges a weapon that uses a Blast marker or Flame
template, a roll of 6 does not automatically cancel the
attack – instead, it allows the fighter to move up to 2"
before seeing if they are hit. They cannot move within
1" of an enemy fighter

### 4. Mighty Leap

When measuring the distance of a gap this fighter
wishes to leap across, ignore the first 2" of the
distance. This means that a fighter with this skill may
leap over gaps of 2" or less without testing against
their Initiative. All other rules for leaping over gaps
still apply.

### 5. Spring Up

If this fighter is Prone and Pinned when they are
activated, make an Initiative test for them. If the test
is passed, the fighter may make a Stand Up (Basic)
action for free. If the test is failed, the fighter may still
stand up, but it costs one action, as usual.

### 6. Sprint

If this fighter makes two Move (Simple) actions when
activated during a round, they can use the second to
Sprint. This lets them move at double their Movement
characteristic for the second Move (Simple) action.

## Brawn

### 1. Bull Charge

When the fighter makes close combat attacks as part
of a Charge (Double) action, any weapons with the
Melee trait they use gain the Knockback trait and are
resolved at +1 Strength.

### 2. Bulging Biceps

This fighter may wield an Unwieldy weapon in one hand
rather than the usual two. Note that Unwieldy weapons
still take up the space of two weapons with regards to
how many a fighter may carry.

### 3. Crushing Blow

Before rolling to hit for the fighter’s close combat
attacks, the controlling player can nominate one dice
to make a Crushing Blow. This cannot be a dice that is
rolling for a weapon with the Sidearm trait. If that dice
hits, the attack’s Strength and Damage are increased
by one.

### 4. Headbutt

If the fighter is Standing and Engaged, they can make
the following action:

**Headbutt (Free):** Pick an enemy fighter engaged by, and in base contact with, this fighter and roll two D6. If
either result is equal to or higher than their Toughness, they suffer a hit with a Strength equal to this fighter’s +2, resolved at Damage 2. However, if both dice score lower than the enemy fighter’s Toughness, this fighter instead suffers a hit equal to their own Strength, resolved at Damage 1.

### 5. Hurl

If the fighter is Standing and Engaged, they can
perform the following action:

**Hurl (Basic):** Pick an enemy fighter engaged by and in
base contact with this fighter, or a Prone and Seriously
Injured enemy fighter within 1" of this fighter. Make
an Initiative test for the enemy fighter. If failed, the
enemy fighter is hurled. Move the enemy fighter D3"
in a direction of your choice – if they were Standing, they become Prone and Pinned after moving. If they
come into base contact with a Standing fighter, vehicle
or any terrain, they stop moving and suffer a Strength
3, Damage 1 hit. If they come into base contact with
another model, that model also suffers a Strength
3, Damage 1 hit, and if the model is a fighter, they
become Prone and Pinned. This action can also be performed for free after
successfully performing a Charge (Double) action
instead of a free Fight (Basic) action.

### 6. Iron Jaw

This fighter’s Toughness is treated as being two higher
than normal when another fighter attacks them in close
combat with a weapon with an AP characteristic of -.

## Combat

### 1. Combat Master

The fighter never suffers penalties to their hit rolls for
interference, and can always grant assists, regardless
of how many enemy fighters they are engaged with.

### 2. Counter-Attack

When this fighter makes Reaction attacks in close
combat, they roll one additional Attack dice for each of
the attacker’s Attacks that failed to hit (whether they
missed, were parried, etc).

### 3. Disarm

Any weapons with the Melee trait used by the fighter
also gain the Disarm trait. If a weapon already has this
Trait then the target will be disarmed on a natural roll
of a 5 or 6, rather than the usual 6.

### 4. Parry

The fighter can parry attacks as though they were
carrying a weapon with the Parry trait. If they already
have one or more weapons with this Trait, they can
parry one additional attack.

### 5. Rain Of Blows

This fighter treats the Fight action as Fight (Simple)
rather than Fight (Basic). In other words, this fighter
may make two Fight (Simple) actions when activated.

:::danger Optional House Rule
Allow the fighter to make 2 consecutive Fight actions when charging (and potentially receiving 2 reaction attacks as well).
:::

### 6. Step Aside

If the fighter is hit in close combat, the fighter can
attempt to step aside. Make an Initiative test for them.
If the test is passed, the attack misses. This skill can
only be used once per enemy in each round of close
combat – in other words, if an enemy makes more
than one attack, the fighter can only attempt to step
aside from one of them.

## Cunning

### 1. Backstab

Any weapons used by this fighter with the Melee trait
also gain the Backstab trait. If they already have this
Trait, add 2 to the attack’s Strength rather than the
usual 1 when the Trait is used.

:::danger Optional House Rule
If benefiting from this skill, apply an additional -1 AP.
:::

### 2. Escape Artist

When this fighter makes a Retreat (Basic) action, add
2 to the result of their Initiative test (a natural 1 still
fails). Additionally, if this fighter is Captured at the end
of a battle, and if they are equipped with a skinblade, they may add 1 to the result of the dice roll to see if
they can escape during the Rescue Mission scenario.

### 3. Evade

If an enemy targets this fighter with a ranged attack, and this fighter is Standing and Active and not in
partial cover or full cover, there is an additional -1
modifier to the hit roll, or a -2 modifier if the attack is at
Long range.

### 4. Infiltrate

If this fighter should be set up at the start of a
battle, they may instead be placed to one side. Then,
immediately before the start of the first round, their
controlling player may set them up anywhere on the
battlefield that is not visible to any enemy fighters, and not within 6" of any of them. If both players have
fighters with this skill, take turns to set one up, starting
with the winner of a roll-off.

:::danger Optional House Rule
Infiltrate can break many scenarios. In those cases, make 2 move actions before the 1st round instead.
:::

### 5. Lie Low

While this fighter is Prone, enemy fighters cannot target
them with a ranged attack unless they are within the
attacking weapon’s Short range. Weapons that do not
have a Short range are unaffected by this rule.

### 6. Overwatch

If this fighter is Standing and Active, and has a
Ready marker on them, they can interrupt a visible
enemy model’s action as soon as it is declared but
before it is carried out. This fighter loses their Ready
marker and then immediately makes a Shoot (Basic)
action, targeting the enemy whose action they have
interrupted. If the enemy is Prone and Pinned or
Seriously Injured as a result, their activation ends
immediately and their action(s) are not made.

## Driving

### 1. Jink

Once per round, when their vehicle is hit by an attack, this crew may attempt to make a special Jink save
which cannot be modified by a weapon’s Armour
Piercing value. Roll a D6. On a roll of 6+, the crew’s
quick reactions enable them to jerk the controls and
avoid the attack. The hit is ignored.

### 2. Expert Driver

When this crew’s vehicle makes a Loss of Control test,
add 1 to the result.

### 3. Heavy Foot

Once per round, when this crew’s vehicle performs
either a Move (Simple) or a Ram (Double) action, the
vehicle may increase its Movement characteristic by
D3". However, doing so is not without risks. If a natural
1 is rolled, the vehicle suffers a single Glancing Hit to
its Engine.

### 4. Slalom

Once per round, when this crew’s vehicle performs a
Move (Simple) action, it may make an additional turn of
up to 45° at any point before, during or after its move.

### 5. T-Bone

If this crew’s vehicle has a Head-on Collision with
another vehicle or terrain feature, this vehicle may
add D3 to its Front Toughness characteristic until the
collision is fully resolved.

### 6. Running Repairs

If, when making a Handling test to Restart this crew’s
vehicle whilst it is Stationary and Stalled, a natural 6 is
rolled, this driver has not only Restarted the vehicle but
repaired some minor damage. The vehicle regains one
lost Hull Point.

## Ferocity

### 1. Berserker

When this fighter makes close combat attacks as part
of a Charge (Double) action, they roll one additional
Attack dice.

### 2. Fearsome

If an enemy wishes to make a Charge (Double) action
that would result in them making one or more close
combat attacks against this fighter, they must make a
Willpower test before moving. If the test is failed, they
cannot move and their activation ends immediately.

### 3. Impetuous

When this fighter consolidates at the end of a close
combat, they may move up to 4", rather than the
usual 2".

:::danger Optional House Rule
If eligible, can both Coup de Grace and Consolidate (2") after a Fight action.
:::

### 4. Nerves Of Steel

When the fighter is hit by a ranged attack, make a Cool
test for them. If it is passed, they may choose not to
become Prone and Pinned.

### 5. True Grit

When making an Injury roll for this fighter, roll one less
Injury dice (for example, a Damage 2 weapon would
roll one dice). Against attacks with Damage 1, roll two
dice – the player controlling the fighter with True Grit
can then choose one dice to discard before the effects
of the other are resolved.

### 6. Unstoppable

Before making a Recovery test for this fighter in
the End phase, roll a D6. If the result is 4 or more, one Flesh Wound they have suffered previously is
discarded. If they do not have any Flesh Wounds, and
the result is a 4 or more, roll one additional dice for the
Recovery test and choose one to discard.

## Leadership

### 1. Commanding Presence

When this fighter activates to make a group activation, they may include one more fighter than normal as part
of the group (i.e., a Champion could activate two other
fighters instead of one, and a Leader could activate
three). This skill cannot be gained by a vehicle and, if
randomly selected, a new skill is randomly selected.

### 2. Inspirational

If a friendly model within 6" of this model fails a
Cool test, make a Leadership test for this model.
If the Leadership test is passed then the Cool test
also counts as having been passed.

### 3. Iron Will

Subtract 1 from the result of any of your Bottle checks
whilst this model is on the battlefield and is not Prone
and Seriously Injured or Wrecked.

### 4. Mentor

Make a Leadership test for this model each time
another friendly model within 6" gains XP. If the test is
passed, the other model gains an additional XP.

### 5. Overseer

If the model is Standing and Active or Mobile, they can
attempt to make the following action:

**Order (Double):** Make a Leadership test for this model.
If the test is passed, pick a friendly fighter within 6". That fighter can immediately make two actions as
though it were their turn to activate, even if they are not
Ready. If they are Ready, these actions do not remove
their Ready marker.

### 6. Regroup

If this model is Standing and Active or Mobile at the
end of their activation, the controlling player may make
a Leadership test for them. If this test is passed, each
friendly model that is currently subject to the Broken
condition and is within 6" immediately recovers from
being Broken.

## Savant

### 1. Ballistics Expert

When this model makes an Aim (Basic) action, make an
Intelligence test for them. If the test is passed, they
gain an additional +1 modifier to their hit roll.

:::danger Optional house rule
Can pre-measure the distance to one enemy fighter when aiming.
:::

### 2. Connected

This model can make a Trade action during the
post-battle sequence, in addition to any other actions
they make (meaning they could even make two Trade
actions). They cannot do this if they are unable to
make actions during the post-battle sequence.

### 3. Fixer

In the Receive Rewards step of the post-battle sequence, as long as this model is not Captured or In Recovery, their gang earns an additional D3x10 credits. Note that
they do not need to have taken part in the battle to
gain this bonus.

### 4. Medicae

This skill cannot be gained by a vehicle and if randomly
selected, a new skill is randomly selected. This fighter
may make the Treat Wounds (Basic) action:

**Treat Wounds (Basic):** Roll a D6. On a 3+ a friendly
fighter within 1" either regains a lost Wound or loses a
Flesh Wound (controlling player’s choice).

### 5. Munitioneer

Whenever an Ammo test is failed for this model, or another model from their gang within 6", it can
be re-rolled.

### 6. Savvy Trader

When this model makes a Trade action in the
post-battle sequence, add an additional 1 to the result
of the dice roll to determine the Availability level of
Rare/Illegal items on offer at the Trading Post on this
visit. Additionally, the cost of one item may be reduced
by 20 credits on this visit. Note that this means one
item, not one type of item. A single power sword may
be purchased for 30 credits, but a second power sword
will still cost 50 credits.

## Shooting

### 1. Fast Shot

This model treats the Shoot and the Fire All actions
as (Simple) rather than (Basic), as long as they do not
attack with a weapon that has the Unwieldy trait (note
that even if a skill or Wargear item allows a model
to ignore one aspect of the Unwieldy trait, Unwieldy
weapons retain the Trait).

:::danger Optional house rule
Apply -1 hit modifier when using this skill.
:::

### 2. Gunfighter

If this model uses the Twin Guns Blazing rule to attack
with two weapons with the Sidearm trait, they do not
suffer the -1 penalty to their hit rolls and can, if they
wish, target a different enemy model with each weapon
with the Sidearm trait.

### 3. Hip Shooting

If the model is a vehicle, it treats the Move & Shoot
action as (Simple) rather than (Basic) as long as it
does not attack with a weapon that has the Unwieldy
trait (note that even if a skill or Wargear item allows
a model to ignore one aspect of the Unwieldy trait,
Unwieldy weapons retain the Trait).

If the model is a fighter and is Standing and Active, they can make the following action:

**Run and Gun (Double):** The fighter may move up to
double their Movement characteristic and then make
an attack with a ranged weapon. The hit roll suffers
an additional -1 modifier, and Unwieldy weapons can
never be used in conjunction with this skill.

:::danger Optional house rule
Apply -1 hit modifier when using this skill.
:::

### 4. Marksman

The model is not affected by the rules for Target
Priority. In addition, if the hit roll for an attack made by
the model with a ranged weapon (that does not have
the Blast trait) is a natural 6, they score a critical hit
and the weapon’s Damage is doubled (if they are firing
a weapon with the Rapid Fire trait, only the Damage of
the first hit is doubled).

### 5. Precision Shot

If the hit roll for a ranged attack made by this model is
a natural 6 (when using a weapon that does not have
the Blast trait), the shot hits an exposed area and no
armour save can be made.

### 6. Trick Shot

When this model makes ranged attacks, they do not
suffer a penalty for the target being engaged or in
partial cover. In addition, if the target is in full cover, they reduce the penalty to their hit roll to -1 rather than -2.

:::danger Optional house rule
Apply +1 modifier to any ammo tests.
