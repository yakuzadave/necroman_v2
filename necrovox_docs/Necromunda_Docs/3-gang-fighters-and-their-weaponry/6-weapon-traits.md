# Weapon Traits

_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

The following list contains all of the Weapon Traits in full.

### Assault Shield/Energy Shield

An assault/energy shield grants a +2 armour save modifier (to a maximum of 2+)
against melee attacks that originate from within the fighter’s vision arc (the 90° arc
to their front), and a +1 armour save modifier against ranged attacks that originate
from within the fighter’s vision arc; check this before the fighter is placed Prone and
is Pinned. If it is not clear whether the attacker is within the target’s Front arc, use
a Vision Arc template to check – if the centre of the attacker’s base is within the
arc, the assault/energy shield can be used. Against attacks with the Blast trait, use
the centre of the Blast marker in place of the attacker. If the target does not have a
facing (for example, if they are Prone), the assault/energy shield cannot be used.

### Backstab

If the attacker is not within the target’s vision arc, add 1 to the attack’s Strength.

### Blast(3"/5"/\*)

The weapon utilises a [Blast marker](/docs/the-rules/shooting#blast-markers).

### Blaze

After an attack with the Blaze trait has been resolved, roll a D6 if the target was hit
but not taken Out of Action or Wrecked. On a 4+, they become subject to the [Blaze condition](/docs/general-principles/conditions#blaze).

:::tip YAQ
Inorganic targets are not affected.

### Burrowing

Burrowing weapons can be fired at targets outside of the firer’s line of sight. When
firing at a target outside of line of sight do not make an attack roll, instead place
the 3" Blast marker anywhere on the battlefield, then move it 2D6" in a direction
determined by the Scatter dice. If a Hit is rolled on the Scatter dice, the Blast marker
does not move. At the start of the End phase of the round in which this weapon was
fired, before step 1, any fighters touched by the marker are hit by the weapon.

Note that this Blast marker can move through impassable terrain such as walls
and may move off the battlefield. If the Blast marker does move off the battlefield, the attack will have no effect. Burrowing weapons are capable of digging through
several levels of wall and flooring, and can be used regardless of where the fighter is
positioned on the battlefield.

### Chem Delivery

When a weapon with the Chem Delivery trait is used, the fighter declares what
kind of chem they are firing at the target. This can be any chem the fighter is
equipped with (note that firing the weapon does not cost a dose of the chem and
that friendly fighters cannot be targeted), or if the weapon also has the Toxin or
Gas trait, the fighter can use these Traits instead. Instead of making a Wound roll
for a Chem Delivery attack, roll a D6. If the result is equal to or higher than the
target’s Toughness, or is a natural 6, the target is affected by the chosen chem just
as if they had taken a dose. If the roll is lower than the target’s Toughness, they
shrug off the chem’s effects.

### Combi

A combi-weapon has two profiles. When it is fired, pick
one of the two profiles and use it for the attack. Due to
the compact nature of these weapons, they often have
less capacity for ammunition, and are prone to jamming
and other minor issues. When making an Ammo test
for either of the weapons, roll twice and apply the
worst result. However, unlike most weapons that have
two profiles, ammo for the two parts of the combiweapon are tracked separately – if one profile runs Out
of Ammo, the other can still fire unless it has also run
Out of Ammo.

### Concussion

Any fighter hit by a Concussion weapon will have their
Initiative reduced by 2, to a minimum of 6+, until the
end of the round. Any vehicle hit by a Concussion
weapon will suffer a -2 penalty to all Handling tests
until the end of the round.

### Crew Operated

_^Missing from the 2023 Core Rules_

This Trait indicates that a weapon fitted to a vehicleisoperated by the crew of the vehicle. This weaponmaybe used during the vehicle’s activation. It uses theBScharacteristic of the vehicle’s crew. In addition, theUnwieldy trait has no effect on this weapon.

### Cursed

A fighter hit by a weapon with the Cursed trait must
pass a Willpower test or gain the [Insane condition](/docs/general-principles/conditions#insane).

### Demolitions

Grenades with the Demolitions trait can be used
when making close combat attacks against scenery
targets (such as locked doors or scenario objectives). A fighter who uses a grenade in this way makes one
attack (regardless of how many Attack dice they would
normally roll), which hits automatically.

### Digi

A Digi weapon is usually worn mounted on a ring or
hidden inside a glove. It can be used in addition to any
other Melee weapon carried by the fighter, granting
an additional close combat attack. A weapon with this
Trait does not count towards the maximum number of
weapons a fighter can carry. However, the maximum
number of weapons with this Trait a fighter can carry
is 10.

### Disarm

If the hit roll for an attack made with a Disarm weapon
is a natural 6, the target cannot use any weapons
when making Reaction attacks for the remainder of
that round – they make unarmed attacks instead.

### Drag

If a fighter is hit by a Drag weapon but not taken
Out of Action, the attacker can attempt to drag the
target closer after the attack has been resolved.
If they do, roll a D6. If the score is equal to or higher
than the target’s Strength, the target is dragged D3"
straight towards the attacker, stopping if they hit any
terrain. If they move into another fighter (other than
the attacker), both fighters are moved the remaining
distance towards the attacker. If the weapon also has
the Impale special rule and hits more than one fighter, only the last fighter to be hit can be dragged.

### Entangle

Hits scored by weapons with the Entangle trait cannot
be negated by the Parry trait. In addition, if the hit roll
for an Entangle weapon is a natural 6, any Reaction
attacks made by the target have an additional -2
hit modifier.

### Esoteric

An Esoteric weapon does not conform to standard
Imperial patterns or fittings, as such they may never be
given any Weapon Accessories, upgraded or modified
in any way.

### Exclusive

An Exclusive weapon cannot be purchased from the
Trading Post, a gang may only purchase it if it appears
on their gang equipment lists.

### Fear

If this attack would result in an Injury roll being made
for any reason, no Injury roll is made and instead the
opposing player makes a Nerve test for the target,
subtracting 2 from the result. If the test fails, the target
is immediately Broken and runs for cover.

### Flare

A model hit by a weapon with the Flare trait, or who is
touched by a Blast marker fired from a weapon with the
Flare trait, is Revealed if the battlefield is in darkness
(see [Pitch Black](/docs/battlefield-setup/scenario-rules#pitch-black--visibility)). If a weapon has both
the Flare trait and the Blast (X") trait, after determining
where the Blast marker ends up, leave it in place.
In the End phase, roll a D6. On a 4+, the flare goes
out and the marker is removed, otherwise it remains
in play. While the Blast marker is on the battlefield, all
models touched by it are Revealed.

### Flash

If a model is hit by a weapon with the Flash trait, no
wound roll is made. Instead, if the target is a fighter
they must make an Initiative test, and if they are a
vehicle they must make a Handling test. If the test
is failed, they become subject to the Blind condition. A Blind model loses their Ready marker; if they do not
have a Ready marker, they do not gain a Ready marker
at the start of the following round. Until the next time
the model is activated, they cannot make any attacks
other than Reaction attacks, for which any hit rolls will
only succeed on a natural 6.

### Force

In the hands of a non-psyker a Force Weapon has no
additional effects. However, when wielded by a fighter
with either the Sanctioned Psyker or Non-sanctioned
Psyker special rule, the weapon gains both the Power
and Sever traits.

### Gas

When a fighter is hit by an attack made by a weapon
with the Gas trait, they do not become Prone and
Pinned and a wound roll is not made. Instead, roll
a D6. If the result is equal to or higher than the
target’s Toughness, or is a natural 6, make an
Injury roll for them (regardless of their Wounds
characteristic). Otherwise, they shrug off the effects of
the gas. No save roll can be made against a weapon
with this Trait.

When a vehicle is hit by an attack made by a weapon
with the Gas trait a wound roll is not made. Instead, roll
a D6. If the result is equal to or higher than the target’s
rear Toughness, or is a natural 6, they suffer a Driver
Wounded result on the Crew Damage table. If the roll
is lower than the target’s Toughness, they shrug off the
effects of the gas. No save roll can be made against a
weapon with this Trait.

### Graviton Pulse

Instead of rolling to wound normally with this weapon, any fighter caught in the Blast must instead roll equal
to or under their Strength on a D6 (a roll of 6 always
counts as a fail), or suffer Damage with no armour
save allowed; any vehicle caught in the Blast must
instead roll equal or over the Toughness value of the
facing hit on a D6 (a roll of a 6 always counts as a
success), or suffer a hit to the Body with no armour
save allowed. After the weapon has been fired, leave
the Blast marker in place. For the remainder of the
round, any model moving through this area will use
2" of their Movement for every 1" they move (note
this affects all vehicles regardless of their Locomotive
special rule). Remove the Blast marker during the
End phase.

### Grenade

Despite being Wargear, grenades are treated as a
special type of ranged weapon. A fighter equipped
with grenades can throw one as a Shoot (Basic)
action. Grenades do not have a Short range, and their
Long range is determined by multiplying the fighter’s
Strength by the amount shown.

A fighter can only carry a limited number of grenades. The Firepower dice does not need to be rolled when
attacking with a grenade. Instead, after the attack has
been resolved, it is assumed that the Ammo symbol has
been rolled and an Ammo test is made automatically. If
this is failed, grenades cannot be reloaded; the fighter
has run out of that type of grenade and cannot use
them for the remainder of the battle.

### Hexagrammatic

The ammo used by this weapon has been specially
treated to defeat psychic defences and severely harm
Psykers. Hits from weapons with this Trait ignore saves
provided by psychic powers. Additionally, weapons with
this Trait will inflict double damage against Psykers.

### Impale

If an attack made by this weapon hits a fighter and
wounds the target, and the save roll is unsuccessful
(or no save roll is made), the projectile continues
through them and might hit another model! Trace a
straight line from the target, directly away from the
attacker. If there are any models within 1" of this line, and within the weapon’s Long range, the one that is
closest to the target is at risk of being hit. Roll a D6. On
a 3 or more, resolve the weapon’s attack against that
model, subtracting 1 from the Strength. The projectile
can continue through multiple fighters in this way, but if the Strength is reduced to 0, it cannot hit any
more models.

### Knockback

When a weapon with the Knockback trait hits a
fighter, if the hit roll is equal to or higher than the
target’s Strength, they are immediately moved 1"
directly away from the attacking model. If the fighter
cannot be moved the full 1" because of impassable
terrain or another model, they move as far as possible
and the attack’s Damage is increased by 1. If a Blast
weapon has the Knockback trait, roll a D6 for each
fighter that is hit. If the result is equal to or higher than
their Strength, they are knocked back as described
above – however, they are moved directly away from
the centre of the Blast marker instead. If the centre
of the Blast marker was over the centre of their base, roll a Scatter dice to determine which way they are
moved. If a Melee weapon has the Knockback trait,
the attacking fighter can choose to follow the target
up, moving directly towards them after they have been
knocked back to remain in base contact. If the attack
was made across a barricade, the attacker cannot
do this. If any part of the knocked back fighter’s base
crosses the edge of a platform, make an Initiative test.
If this is failed, they will fall. If this is passed, they stop
moving at the edge of the platform.

### Limited

This special rule is applied to some special ammo types which can be purchased for weapons.

If a weapon fails an Ammo test while using Limited ammo, they have run out – that ammo type is deleted from their Fighter or Vehicle card, and cannot be used again until more of that special ammo is purchased from the
Trading Post.

This is in addition to the normal rules for the weapon running Out of Ammo. The weapon can still
be reloaded as normal, using its remaining profile(s).

:::tip YAQ
Only a single ‘dose’ of ammo can be carried per weapon. Reduce fighter’s cost accordingly after the ammo is lost.
:::

### Master-Crafted

Once per battle, a weapon with the Master-crafted trait
may re-roll a single failed hit roll.

### Melee

This weapon can be used during close combat attacks.

### Melta

If a Short range attack from a weapon with this Trait
reduces a fighter to 0 wounds, no Injury dice are rolled – instead, any Injury dice that would be rolled cause an
automatic Out of Action result.

If a Short range attack from a weapon with this Trait
wounds a vehicle, roll an additional Damage dice.

If a weapon with this Trait has no Short range, then the
Trait applies to all attacks made by it.

### Paired

_^Missing from the 2023 Core Rules_

A fighter that is armed with Paired weapons counts as
being armed with dual weapons with the Melee trait
for the purposes of calculating the number of Attack
dice they will roll. Additionally, when making a Charge
(Double) action, their Attacks characteristic is doubled.
Fighters subject to the Mounted condition gain no
benefit from this Trait

### Parry

After an enemy makes close combat attacks against
a fighter armed with a Parry weapon, the fighter can
force the attacking player to re-roll one successful hit.
If the fighter is armed with two Parry weapons, they
can force the attacking player to re-roll two successful
hits instead.

### Phase

_^Missing from the 2023 Core Rules_

Save rolls granted by armour or field armour cannot bemade against a weapon with this Trait. If the target ishit, treat them as having no save. Note, however, that
saves granted by a special rule may still be made–this Trait only ignores armour and field armour.

Vehicles cannot make armour saves against a weaponwith this Trait.

### Plentiful

Ammunition for this weapon is incredibly common. When reloading it, no Ammo test is required – it is
automatically reloaded.

### Power

The weapon is surrounded by a crackling power field. Attacks made by Power weapons cannot be Parried
except by other weapons with the Power trait.
In addition, if the hit roll for a Power weapon is a
natural 6, no save roll can be made against the attack
(except Field armour save rolls) and its Damage is
increased by 1.

### Pulverise

After making an Injury roll for an attack made by this
weapon, the attacking player can roll a D6. If the result
is equal to or higher than the target’s Toughness, or
is a natural 6, they can change one Injury dice froma Flesh Wound result to a Serious Injury result, or if
targeting a vehicle roll an additional Damage dice.

### Rad-Phage

After fully resolving any successful hits a fighter suffers
from a weapon with this Trait, roll an additional D6. On
a 4+, the fighter will suffer an additional Flesh Wound.

### Rapid Fire (X)

When firing with a Rapid Fire weapon, a successful
hit roll scores a number of hits equal to the number
of bullet holes on the Firepower dice. In addition, the
controlling player can roll more than one Firepower
dice, up to the number shown in brackets (for example, when firing a Rapid Fire (2) weapon, up to two Firepower dice can be rolled). Make an Ammo test for each Ammo symbol that is rolled. If any of them fail, the gun runs Out of Ammo. If two or more of them fail, the gun has jammed and cannot be used for the rest
of the battle.

If a Rapid Fire weapon scores more than one hit, the hits can be split between multiple targets. The
first must be allocated to the original target, but the remainder can be allocated to other models within 3"
of the first who are also within range and line of sight. These must not be any harder to hit than the original target – if a target in the open is hit, an obscured target cannot have hits allocated to it. Allocate all of the hits before making any wound rolls.

### Reckless

Reckless weapons are indiscriminate in what they target:

- Before making a ranged attack with a Reckless weapon, randomly determine the target of the attack from all eligible models (including friendly
  models) within this model’s line of sight and range of the weapon.
- Attacks made with a Reckless weapon that also has the Melee trait are randomly distributed between any
  models (including friendly models) that are in base
  contact with this fighter.
- Attacks made with a Reckless weapon that also has the Versatile trait are randomly distributed between
  any models (including friendly models) that are within the weapon’s Long range.

If the weapon also has the Rapid Fire (X) trait, then
any additional hits generated from the Firepower dice
must be distributed among the maximum number of eligible targets. If there are more hits than eligible targets, the attacker may choose where any spare hits
are allocated.

### Rending

If the roll to wound with a Rending weapon is a 6, then the attack causes 1 extra point of Damage if the target is a fighter, or rolls an extra Damage dice if the target is a vehicle.

### Scarce

Ammunition is hard to come by for Scarce weapons, and as such they cannot be reloaded – once they
run Out of Ammo, they cannot be used again during
the battle.

### Scattershot

When a target is hit by a Scattershot attack, make D6
wound rolls instead of 1.

### Seismic

If a fighter hit by a weapon with this Trait is Standing
and Active, they will always become Prone and Pinned – even if they have an ability that would normally allow
them to avoid becoming Prone and Pinned by ranged
attacks. If a vehicle is hit by a weapon with this Trait,
after the attack has been fully resolved the vehicle
must make a Loss of Control test.

In addition, if the wound roll for a Seismic weapon
is a natural 6, no save roll can be made against
that attack.

### Sever

If a wound roll from a weapon with this Trait reduces a
fighter to 0 wounds, no Injury dice are rolled – instead, any Injury dice that would be rolled cause an automatic
Out of Action result.

### Shield Breaker

Weapons with this Trait ignore the effects of the
Assault Shield/Energy Shield trait. In addition, when
a target equipped with Field Armour is wounded
by a weapon with this Trait, they must roll two dice
when making a Field Armour save and choose the
lower result.

### Shock

If the hit roll for a Shock weapon is a natural 6, the
wound roll is considered to automatically succeed
(no wound roll needs to be made).

### Sidearm

Weapons with this Trait can be used to make ranged
attacks, and can also be used in close combat to make
a single attack. Note that their Accuracy bonus only
applies when making a ranged attack, not when used
to make a close combat attack.

### Silent

In scenarios that use the Sneak Attack special rules, there is no test to see whether the alarm is raised when this weapon is fired. Additionally, if using the
Visibility (X") rules, a model using this weapon that is
Hidden does not become Revealed.

### Single Shot

This weapon can only be used once per battle. After use, it counts as having automatically failed an
Ammo test. There is no need to roll the Firepower dice
unless the weapon also has the Rapid Fire (X) trait.

### Smoke

Smoke weapons do not cause hits on models – they do
not cause Pinning, and cannot inflict wounds. Instead, mark the location where they hit with a marker. They
generate an area of dense smoke, which extends 2.5"
out from the centre of the marker, vertically as well
as horizontally. Models can move through the smoke, but it blocks line of sight, so attacks cannot be made
into, out of or through it. In the End phase, roll a D6.
On a 4 or less, the cloud dissipates and the marker
is removed.

### Template

Template weapons use the [Flame template](/docs/the-rules/shooting#flame-templates) to
determine how many targets they hit.

### Toxin

Instead of making a wound roll for a Toxin attack, roll a D6. If the result is equal to or higher than
the target’s Toughness, or is a natural 6, make
an Injury roll for them (regardless of their Wounds
characteristic). If the roll is lower than the
target’s Toughness, they shrug off the toxin’s effects. This attack has no effect on vehicles.

### Twin-Linked

_^Missing from the 2023 Core Rules_

When a model makes a ranged attack with this weapon,
they may re-roll any number of the Ammo dice rolled.
However, they must accept the result of the re-roll, even
if it is worse.

### Unstable

If the Ammo symbol is rolled on the Firepower dice when attacking with this weapon, there is a chance that, in addition to needing an Ammo test, the weapon will prove as hazardous to its user as the enemy.

Roll a D6. On a 1, 2 or 3, something has gone wrong; if the attacker is a fighter they are taken Out of Action, if the weapon is mounted on a vehicle the vehicle suffers a Catastrophic Hit to the body and the weapon cannot be used again for the rest of the battle. The attack is still resolved against the target.

### Unwieldy

A Shoot action made with this weapon counts as a Double action as opposed to a Basic action.

In addition, a fighter who uses a weapon with both the Unwieldy and Melee traits in close combat cannot use a second weapon at the same time – this one requires both hands to use.

:::danger House Rule (Necrodamus, A&A)
Apply -1 hit modifier if shooting Unwieldy weapons as anything other than Double action.
:::

### Versatile

The wielder of a Versatile weapon does not need to
be in base contact with an enemy model in order to
engage them in melee during their activation. They
may engage and make close combat attacks against
an enemy model during their activation, so long as the
distance between their base and that of the enemy
model is equal to or less than the distance shown for
the Versatile weapon’s Long range characteristic. For
example, a fighter armed with a Versatile weapon with
a Long range of 2" may engage an enemy model that is
up to 2" away.

The enemy model is considered to be engaged, but
may not in turn be Engaging the fighter armed with
the Versatile weapon unless they too are armed with
a Versatile weapon, and so may not be able to make
Reaction attacks.

At all other times other than during this
fighter’s activation, Versatile has no effect.

### Web

If the wound roll for a Web attack against a fighter is
successful, no wound is inflicted, and no save roll or
Injury roll is made. Instead, the target automatically
becomes [Webbed](/docs/general-principles/conditions#webbed).
