BATTLEFIELD SET-UP
Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)

Some scenarios will have special instructions on how to set up the battlefield; the default methods are as follows:

UNDERHIVE
The battlefields of the Underhive vary vastly, from complexes of cramped tunnels, raucous marketplaces, rogue factoria and foundries to gang strongholds and even bustling settlements. The thing they all have in common though is they are fully enclosed, protected from the unpredictable and harsh weather of the wastes.

When fighting a battle in the Underhive, the Battlefield Conditions rules are not used and no gang may include either vehicles or Wargear that grants the Mounted condition in either their crew or Reinforcements.

For Underhive battles, between a 3'x3' and a 4'x4' battlefield is ideal, although larger and smaller battlefields are also possible! Starting with the defender (or the winner of a roll-off if the scenario does not specify a defender), players alternate placing terrain features upon the battlefield. Once one player passes, then the other player may place one more piece of terrain. Alternatively, if using Zone Mortalis Tiles players alternate placing the tiles on the battlefield.

Then, starting with the defender again, players alternate placing obstacles and other small terrain features. Once one player passes, the other player may place one more terrain feature.

Finally, each player places a Loot Casket anywhere on the battlefield.

INFO
TUNNEL WARFARE
When creating an Underhive battlefield, the default is that the ceiling is high up above the ground and so walls can be climbed up onto and stairs and ladders used. However if both players agree, the claustrophobic confines of tunnel battles can be recreated by stating that the ceiling is at the height of one wall section, meaning walls cannot be climbed over, and stairs and ladders can not be used.

ASH WASTES
Out in the Ash Wastes, the ground itself can be dangerous to walk on; the only safe places are the settlements that have sprung up throughout the wastes and along the sprawling, dust-strewn road surfaces that connect the hives. Battlefields out in the wastes tend to be less claustrophobic and densely packed than those found in the underhive and players are encouraged to reflect this when setting up the battlefield.

When fighting battles in the Ash Wastes, the rules for Battlefield Conditions are in use. Also, vehicles and Wargear that grants the Mounted condition can be included in both gangs’ starting crew and Reinforcements.

For battlefields set in the Ash Wastes, 4'x4' is ideal though larger battlefields are also appropriate, especially if playing a Rolling Roads scenario. Mark up a section of the battlefield as a road – this should be between 6"-8" wide and run fromone battlefield edge to another. Then players alternate placing terrain features, starting with the defender (or the winner of a roll-off if the scenario does not have a defender). Once one player passes, the other player may place one last piece of terrain.

Then, starting with the defender again, players alternate placing obstacles and other small terrain features. Once one player passes, the other player may place one more terrain feature.

Finally, each player places a Loot Casket anywhere on the battlefield.
