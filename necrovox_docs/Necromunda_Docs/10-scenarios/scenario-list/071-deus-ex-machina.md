# 71. Deus Ex Machina

_A cruel intelligence stirs deep within the underhive._

**Source: House of Artifice**

:::info Designer's Note: Death For All!

While the scenarios presented here have been designed specifically for House Van Saar gangs, there is no reason that, with the permission of the Arbitrator, they might not be used for any gang. Scenarios such as

Deus Ex Machina lend themselves well to multi-player scenarios, where multiple gangs attempt to bring down an Archaeo-Cyborg. By contrast, Last Rites for the Machine makes for an interesting Arbitrated game, with the Arbitrator taking control of the Fading Legend while one gang attempts to protect them from destruction – or, alternatively, the Arbitrator can bring an entire cabal of Archeoteks, pitting them against the players and their gangs.

## Battlefield

This scenario uses the Battlefield Set-up guidelines, as described in the Necromunda Rulebook.

## Attacker & Defender

In this scenario, one gang is the attacker and the other
is the defender. If one gang is of House Van Saar and
their opponent is not, then the House Van Saar gang
will be the attacker. Otherwise, the player whose gang
has the lower rating is the attacker. If both gangs have
the same rating, players roll off and the winner decides
whether they will attack or defend.

## Crews

This scenario uses the standard rules for choosing a
crew, as described in the Battlefield Set-up & Scenarios
section of the Necromunda Rulebook. The attacker
uses the Custom Selection (10) method to choose their
crew. The defender uses the Random Selection (10)
method to determine their crew.

## Deployment

This scenario uses the standard rules for deployment,
as described in the Necromunda Rulebook.

## Gang Tactics

Each player may choose two gang tactics from those
available to their gang. If, during the pre-battle
sequence, the total credits value of fighters in one
player’s starting crew is less than their opponent’s,
they may randomly determine one additional gang
tactic for each full 100 credits of difference.

## Ending The Battle

The battle ends when only one gang has fighters
remaining on the battlefield or when the fighter
harbouring the Abominable Intelligence has been
taken Out of Action and the Abominable Intelligence
captured.

## Victory

The attacker wins if, at the end of the battle, the
Abominable Intelligence has been captured. The
defender wins if, at the end of the battle, the attacker
has no fighters remaining on the battlefield and the
Abominable Intelligence has not been captured. Any
other result is a draw.

## Rewards

### Credits

The victorious gang adds D6x10 credits to their Stash.

### Experience

- Each fighter who took part in the battle earns 1 XP.
- If, at the end of the battle, the Abominable Intelligence has been captured, the fighter that captured it earns D3 XP.

### Reputation

- If the defender is victorious, they gain D3 Reputation.
- If the attacker is victorious, they gain D3 Reputation.
- If either gang bottled out, they lose 1 Reputation.

## Ghost Of The Machine Spirit

A single randomly determined fighter within the defender’s starting crew has been
possessed by the Abominable Intelligence residing within a tech-trinket picked up as
a curio from the local bazaar. The influence of this malign machine spirit improves
each of this fighter’s characteristics by 1 (to a maximum of 1+ or 10, as appropriate)
for the duration of this battle.

In addition, this fighter may make a 5+ save roll against any attack made against
them. This save cannot be modified by a weapon’s Armour Piercing value. However,
only one save attempt can be made per attack, therefore the controlling player must
choose to either make a save attempt using the fighter’s armour save, or using this
special rule.

The player controlling the defending gang should place an appropriate marker on this
fighter’s Fighter card, representing the tech-trinket.

The identity of this fighter is known to the attackers at the start of the battle, and
the attackers are hunting this fighter, certain that the machine spirit possessing
them holds many secrets. To aid them, every member of the attacker’s starting
crew has been equipped with a containment unit with which to capture the
Abominable Intelligence.

## Capturing the Abominable Intelligence

The attacker’s first priority is to take the possessed fighter Out of Action. Once this
is done, the Abominable Intelligence can be captured. Should the possessed fighter
be taken Out of Action, when the model is removed from play, replace it on the
battlefield with the tech-trinket marker. This represents the tech-trinket harbouring
the Abominable Intelligence being dropped by the downed fighter.

Any member of the attacking gang that is within 1" of this marker can attempt to
capture it using their containment device. To do so, the fighter makes the Operate
Containment Device (Double) action and immediately makes an Intelligence check
with a -2 modifier. If this check is passed, the fighter takes possession of the
marker (place it on their Fighter card). If this check is failed, the marker remains on
the battlefield.

## “That’s Ours!”

Whilst the marker representing the tech-trinket lies on the battlefield and is not in
the possession of a fighter, any member of the defending gang can pick it up. To do
so, the fighter must be within 1" of the marker and must perform the Pick Up Techtrinket
(Simple) action.

Once a fighter has picked up the tech trinket, they become possessed by the
Abominable Intelligence (as described above). The marker is placed on their Fighter
card and they immediately become the focus of the attackers’ attention!
