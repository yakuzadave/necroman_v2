# 5. Sneak Attack

_A gang that really wants to make itself known may raid deep into an enemy territory, hoping to steal goods and defile something sacred._

_Source: Necromunda 2018 Rulebook_  
**Designed for: Zone Mortalis**

## Attacker & Defender

The gang who chose this scenario is the attacker, the other is the defender. Otherwise, randomize one gang to choose who to be attacker and defender.

## Battlefield

Standard: 7 tiles. The winner of a roll-off places the first tile. This tile marks the centre of the battlefield. Take turns placing 6 more tiles, adjacent to the first tile.

## Crews

- **Attacker:** Custom.
- **Defender:** Custom (5 Sentries) + Reinforcements.

If a sentry has multiple equipment sets, randomize which one is used.

## Home Turf Advantage

Defender:

- **Bottle tests:** Roll 2D6 and discard the highest.
- **Rally tests:** +1.
- **Hangers-on:** Included in the crew on a 4+ (roll individually).

## Tactics Cards

- Attacker: Custom (3).
- Defender: Random (2) (only usable after the alarm is raised).
- Underdog (starting crew cost): +1 random per 100 credits.

## Deployment

The defender sets up their sentries anywhere on the battlefield, and a gang relic anywhere within 6” of one edge of the battlefield. The attacker then sets up each of their fighters within 4” of any edge of the battlefield and must be within 4” of another member of the crew. The attacker is free to use all edges.

:::danger House Rule (Necrodamus)
The Relic should be deployed within 6” of the centre, or the attackers should deploy on the opposite battlefield edge.
:::

## Gang Relics

_The attacker is trying to defile a gang relic, the defenders are trying to stop them._

- +2 for any Cool and Leadership tests made by friendly fighters within 6” of the gang relic (while undefiled).

#### Defiling a Relic

_If the relic is left unprotected, the enemy will try to wreck it, tear it down, mark it with their own gang's tag or ruin it in a more creative fashion!_

Spend a Double action within 1” to wreck the relic. It no longers offers any bonuses and can't be wrecked again.

## Reinforcements

- D3 defenders.
- Start of each End phase.
- Within 1" of any battlefield edge and at least 12" from enemies (deployed by the controlling gang).

:::danger House Rule (Necrodamus)
Reinforcements should only arrive in each turn after the alarm is raised (including the round that the alarm is raised).
:::

## Fleeing the Battlefield

If the defender voluntarily Bottles out and flees the battlefield, the attacker automatically wins the scenario. The attacking Leader is considered to have defiled the gang relic.

## Ending the Battle

The battle ends when only one gang has fighters remaining (at the end of a round).

## Victory

The attacker wins by having remaining fighters (not including Seriously Injured fighters) and defiled the gang relic. The defender wins by having remaining fighters (not including Seriously Injured fighters) and the gang relic is not defiled. Otherwise it is a draw.

## Rewards

#### Credits

- If the Gang Relic **was** defiled:
  - D6x10 to the attacker.
  - D3x10 to the defender.
- If the gang relic was **not** defiled:
  - D6x10 to the defender.
  - D3x10 to the attacker.

#### Experience

Scenario specific rewards:

- +1 for taking part.
- +D3 to an attacking fighter defiling a relic.
- +1 to the Leader of the gang which had fighters on the battlefield at the end of the battle (regardless of whether they took part in the battle or not).

Standard rewards:

- +1 for taking an enemy Out of Action.
- +1 for taking an enemy Leader or Champion Out of Action.
- +1 for killing an enemy (during the battle).
- +1 for Rallying.

#### Reputation

- +2 to the attacker if the gang relic was defiled.
- -2 to the defender if the gang relic was defiled.
- +1 to both gangs if this was the first battle against each other.
- -1 to any gang that bottled out.
