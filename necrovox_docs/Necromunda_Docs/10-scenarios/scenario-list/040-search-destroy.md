# 40. Search & Destroy

_Gangs seek to clear an area of their enemies._

**Source: Book of Ruin**

## Attacker & Defender

The gang who chose this scenario is the attacker, the other is the defender. Otherwise, randomize one gang to choose who to be attacker and defender.

## Battlefield

Standard.

## Crews

- **Defender:** Random (D3+3) + Reinforcement.
- **Attacker:** Custom (10).

## Tactics Cards

## Deployment

Standard.

## Sweep and Clear

Divide the battlefield into 4 equal-sized areas. A weapon cache is hidden in each area and must be discovered.

- Attacker: Destroy
- Defender: Recover

At the start of each round, a gang can declare 1 or more fighters are searching 1 or more areas. The fighters must be Active and more than 6” from a battlefield edge. Searching fighters lose the Ready status and may not be activated for this round.

In the End phase, each searching fighter still Active can roll a 5+ to find the weapon cache. If both gangs are searching the same area, start with the gang with Priority. If found, place a weapon cache next to the fighter who found it.

#### Weapon Caches

Counts as loot caskets. Once found, it must be carried off the battlefield by the defender or destroyed by the attacker.

- Defender:
  - Removed after being carried into the defending deployment zone.
  - +2 points.
- Attacker:
  - Spend a Double action while B2B. Pass an Intelligence test to destroy it. Add a +1 modifier for each friendly fighter within 2”.
  - +1 point.

## Reinforcements

- Defender: 1.
- Each End phase (starting on the 2nd round).

## Ending the Battle

The battle ends when at least 1 condition is true:

- Only one gang has fighters remaining.
- All weapon caches are destroyed or recovered.

## Victory

The gang that gathered the most loot points is the winner. If the score is equal:

- **Uprising:** The gang with Ascendancy is the winner.
- **Otherwise:** Draw.

## Rewards

:::danger House Rule (Necrodamus)

**Problem:** Infiltrate can be imbalanced or break this scenario.

**Solution:** If at least one player wants, Infiltrate can't be used in this scenario. Instead, Infiltrating fighters can make 1 or 2 move actions before the first round.
