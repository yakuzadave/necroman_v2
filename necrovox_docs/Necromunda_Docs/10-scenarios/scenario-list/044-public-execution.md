# 44. Public Execution

_The gang must save one of their own before time runs out._

**Source: Book of Ruin**

:::info Rescuing Gangers
The attacker can choose this scenario in place of the Rescue Mission to recover captured fighters. If freed, the prisoner becomes Ready and joins the attacker’s crew instead, with the fighter’s weapons and equipment (assuming the attackers brought extra guns with them).

If the attackers fail, the Captive is executed, with the same effect as being Sold to the Guilders.

:::

## Attacker & Defender

If only one gang is Chaotic, then that gang is the attacker. Otherwise, the gang who chose this scenario is the attacker, the other is the defender.

## Battlefield

Standard.

## Crews

- **Attacker:** Custom (D3+7).
- **Defender:** Random (D3+7) + Reinforcements.

## Tactics Cards

- Custom (2).
- Underdog (starting crew cost): +1 random per 100 credits.

## Deployment

1. **Prisoner:** In the centre of the battlefield.
1. **Defender:** Within 6” of the prisoner.
1. **Attacker:** Within 2” of any battlefield edge.

## Reinforcements

Defender: 1.
Each End phase (starting on the 2nd round).

## Execution Clock

_The attacker only has a short time before the prisoner meets the end._

The execution clock starts on 6. In the End phase of any round, the clock is temporarily halted until the next End phase if:

- At least 1 Active attacker within 3” of the prisoner.
- No defender have LOS to any attacker.
- An attacker is in possession of a chrono crystal.

If the clock is not temporarily halted, the clock is reduced by 1 for each of the following:

- At least 1 Active defender within 3” of the prisoner.
- At least 1 defender taken Out of Action this round.
- Defending Leader taken Out of Action.

When the clock count down to 0 (or less), the prisoner suffers an Injury roll. The prisoner goes Out of Action on any result except Flesh Wound (successful execution). If suffering a Flesh Wound, roll again in the following End phase with an additional Injury dice for each Flesh Wound suffered.

## The Prisoner

_The prisoner is well-restrained and consigned to the fate._

Until freed, the prisoner takes no part in the battle, can't be targeted by attacks or affected by Blast/Template. An attacking fighter can free the prisoner by spending a Double action within 1”. Once freed, the prisoner will attempt to flee the battlefield. Once freed, the execution clock no longer apply (the prisoner slipped the noose!).

#### Fleeing Prisoner

- Controlled by the attacker.
- Moves 3D6” in each End phase (must remain outside 1” of enemies).
- Counts as a fighter for all purposes and can be targeted by attacks.
- Never becomes Ready.
- Use the profile for an attacking ganger or similar.
- Successfully escapes when reaching any battlefield edge.

## Ending the Battle

The battle ends when at least one of the following is true:

- Only one gang has fighters remaining.
- The prisoner escapes.

## Victory

- **Defender:** Win if the prisoner is executed.
- **Attacker:** Win if the prisoner escapes.
- If the prisoner is still on the battlefield at the end of the battle:
  - **Uprising:** The gang with Ascendancy is the winner.
  - **Otherwise:** Draw.

## Rewards

#### Credits

- **Attacker:** 2D6x10 for winning.
- **Defender:** D6x10 for winning.

#### Experience

Scenario specific rewards:

- +1 for taking part.
- +1 for freeing the prisoner.

Standard rewards:

- +1 for taking an enemy Out of Action.
- +1 for taking an enemy Leader or Champion Out of Action.
- +1 for killing an enemy (during the battle).
- +1 for Rallying.

#### Reputation
