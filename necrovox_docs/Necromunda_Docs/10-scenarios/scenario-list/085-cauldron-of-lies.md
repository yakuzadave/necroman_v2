# 85. Cauldron of Lies

_Victory is forever moving just out of reach._

**Source: House of Shadow**

:::info Designer's Note: Bringing Faith to the Faithless

While the scenarios presented here have been designed specifically for House
Delaque gangs, there is no reason that, with the permission of the Arbitrator, they might not be used for any gang.

Cauldron of Lies lends itself well to
multi-player games â€“ where multiple gangs must fight in a chaotic free-for-all
as the very win conditions they are fighting for changes from round to round.

Intelligence Gathering is the perfect opportunity for a gang to test its skill, not
just measuring its strength by the size of its crew or the firepower it can muster, but by its ability to survive long enough without taking out the foe to get the info
it needs

:::

## Battlefield

Standard.

In addition, each gang places 5 Loot caskets each, anywhere at least 8" from any battlefield edge.

:::danger House Rule (Necrodamus)

Loot caskets have limited deployment restrictions, allowing both gangs to retrieve 5 loot caskets in round 1.

Solution: Each gang must place 5 loot caskets in the opponent's half of the battlefield.

:::

## Crews

Custom (6).

## Tactics Cards

- Custom (2).
- Underdog (starting crew cost): +1 random per 100 credits

## Deployment

Standard.

## Hidden Truths

_Victory is forever moving just out of reach. The true motives of the gangs are hidden and simple confrontation might not be an end unto itself._

At the start of the battle (after deployment), each gang secretly choose one of the following agendas (win condition):

- **Kill Them All!** Take 5 enemies Out of Action.
- **Escape the Underhive** 5 friendly fighters B2B with the battlefield edge of the enemy deployment zone.
- **Hidden Treasures** Get 5 Loot caskets back to the deployment area.

#### Unseen Influence

At the start of each round, each gang choose an agenda to nullify for the enemy. The enemy cannot win by completing the nullified agenda this round. The same agenda cannot be nullified two rounds in a row.

**If Multi-player:**

- Secretly vote on one agenda to be nullified (in case of a tie, randomize an agenda).

## Ending the Battle

The battle ends when any of the following are true:

- Only one gang remains on the battlefield.
- An agenda is completed.

## Victory

The gang that completed it's agenda is the winner. If no agendas were completed, all gangs lose.

## Rewards

#### Experience

Scenario specific rewards:

- +1 for taking part.
- +1 to the winning Leader.

Standard rewards:

- +1 for taking an enemy Out of Action.
- +1 for taking an enemy Leader or Champion Out of Action.
- +1 for killing an enemy (during the battle).
- +1 for Rallying.

#### Reputation

- +D3 to the winner.
- -1 for bottling out.

:::danger House Rule (Necrodamus)

This scenario is broken. The enemy can always prevent victory (forcing everyone to lose) by voluntarily failing the Bottle test, then fleeing the battlefield.

Solution: The attacker wins if the defender voluntarily bottles out OR flees the battlefield voluntarily.
