## Attacker & Defender

Tie-breaker for determining the attacker:

1. Highest rating.
2. Roll-off (the winner can choose attacker/defender).

The other gang is the defender.

:::info Outlander Campaign

The gang who issued the challenge is the attacker.

## Battlefield

Standard. 12" circle radius in the centre is the [Underhive Market](/docs/battlefield-setup/special-terrian-features/special-terrain#underhive-market).

:::info Outlander Campaign

If the defender has any defences then these may be placed anywhere on the battlefield.

## The Market

_Neither side is packing heavy weapons for the fight - the attacker has snuck into the rival's market with only what they can hide on their person, while the defender doesn't want to shoot up their own settlement._

A market typically consists of market stalls and scatter terrain arranged in a 12" diameter area. In addition, the following can't be used when fighting in the market or shooting into the market (applies to all gangs):

|            4-5             | It Wasn't Nailed Down: A Common item worth 30 or less (after the battle).             |
|             6              | Jackpot!: Select 3 different items with Rarity 9 or less, then randomize one to gain. |
