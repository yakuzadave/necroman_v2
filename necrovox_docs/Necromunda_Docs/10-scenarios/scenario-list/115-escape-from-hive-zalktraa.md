# 115. Escape From Hive Zalktraa

_“We’ve gotta make a break for it, quick before they come back!”_  
\- Prisoner 3874

In this scenario, a gang tries to rescue one of their own from Prison Hive Zalktraa.

## Attacker & Defender

The gang who chose this scenario is the attacker, the other is the defender. Otherwise, randomize one gang to choose who to be attacker and defender.

## Battlefield

Standard (Zone Mortalis or Sector Mechanicus).

#### Flood: Drowned Hive

The area is gradually being flooded.

After terrain has been placed, each gang places one permanent Blast (12") anywhere with the effect of difficult terrain.

## Crews

- **Attacker:** Custom (8).
- **Defender:** Custom (4) + Reinforcements.

No vehicles or mounts.

If a sentry has multiple equipment sets, randomize which one is used.

## Tactics Cards

- **Attacker:** Custom (3).
- **Defender:** Random (2) (only usable after the alarm is raised).
- **Underdog** (Gang Rating): +1 random per 100 credits.

## Deployment

1. **Defender:** Deploy sentries and the captive anywhere.
2. **Attacker:** Within 2" of any battlefield edges (can use all edges).

## The Target

_A gang tries to rescue one of their own from Prison Hive Zalktraa._

This scenario is intended to be used if one or more fighters from the attacker's gang are Captured by the defender's gang. These models are the Captives.

Skirmish: The attacker chooses a fighter to be the Captive.

## Captive Models

Captive fighters never become Ready, and can't be activated or attacked by either side.

## Free Captive

Non-Captive attackers can spend a Basic action (Free Captive) to free a Captive within 1” on a 3+.

## Attempt To Escape

In each End phase, any Captive can attempt to escape. Roll 2D6 + Strength (individually) per Captive that attempts to escape:

| &nbsp;&nbsp;2D6&nbsp;&nbsp; | Result                |
| :-------------------------: | --------------------- |
|             2-6             | Suffer a Flesh Wound. |
|            7-12             | No effect.            |
|             13+             | Freed.                |

#### Freed Captives

Freed Captives become Ready at the start of the following round and activate as normal. It is assumed that the rescuers return all equipment to them, or collect it from nearby.

If having multiple equipment sets, randomize one to use.

## Taking Flight

Attackers within 1” of a battlefield edge at the start of the End phase can take flight (including Seriously Injured). They count as being Out of Action for the purpose of Bottle tests.

## Home Turf Advantage

Defender:

- **Bottle tests:** Roll 2D6 and discard the highest.
- **Rally tests:** +1.
- **Hangers-on:** Included in the crew on a 4+ (roll individually).

## Reinforcements

- Defender: D6.
- Each End phase (starting on the round the alarm is raised).

## Fleeing The Battlefield

If the defender voluntarily bottles out and subsequently flees the battlefield, the attacker automatically wins and all Captives are freed.

## Ending the Battle

The battle ends when only one gang remains at the end of a round.

## Victory

- The attacker wins if all Captives were freed and took flight.
- The defender wins if no Captives took flight.
- Otherwise it is a draw.

## Rewards

#### Experience

Scenario specific rewards:

- +1 for taking part.
- +D3 for freeing a Captive (attacker).
- +1 to a Captive taking flight.
- +D3 to attacking Leader for winning (regardless of whether they took part in the battle or not).

Standard rewards:

- +1 for taking an enemy Out of Action.
- +1 for taking an enemy Leader or Champion Out of Action.
- +1 for killing an enemy (during the battle).
- +1 for Rallying.

#### Reputation

- +1 per freed Captive (to the attacker).
- -1 (bottle out).

:::info Narrative Variant

## Daring Breakout

If players wish, they may use this scenario to represent Lady Credo leading a group of rogue Van Saar to rescue an unknown prisoner.

In order to do this, make the following changes:

- The attackers should be a Van Saar gang including [Lady Credo](/docs/gangs/gang-additions/alliances/criminals#lady-credo).
- The defenders should be a Palanite Enforcers gang.
