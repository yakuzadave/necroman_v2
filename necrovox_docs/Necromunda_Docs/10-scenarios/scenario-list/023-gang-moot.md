# 23. Gang Moot

_A gang parlay gets bloody!_

_Source: Necromunda 2018 Rulebook_  

## Battlefield

Standard.

## Crews

- Random (D3+5) + the Leader.

## Tactics Cards

- Random (2).

## Deployment

Using Priority to determine the order, place the Leaders within 6” of the centre of the board. Take turns placing the fighters anywhere on the battlefield, at least 12” from a Leader and 6” from any already deployed fighter (friend & foe).

## Special Rule: Parlay

The gangs are meeting to hammer out a treaty or settle some other kind of business - when suddenly someone goes for a gun!

At the start of the battle only Leaders are ready, all other fighters are unaware that their allies are about to become enemies. When a fighter takes a Shoot action (unless the weapon has the Silent trait), all other unready fighters within 12” can pass an Intelligence test to become Ready. Fighters attacked in close combat or hit with a shooting attack also become Ready (as long as they survive). In the End phase, each unready fighter can move 6” in any direction.

## Ending the Battle

The battle ends when only one gang has fighters remaining.

## Victory

The winner is the gang with the Leader still on the battlefield (not Seriously Injured). Otherwise it is a draw.

## Rewards

- +1 for taking part.
