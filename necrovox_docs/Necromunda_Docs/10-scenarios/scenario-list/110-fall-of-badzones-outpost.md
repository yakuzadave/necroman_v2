## Attacker & Defender

The gang who chose this scenario is the attacker, the other is the defender. Otherwise, randomize one gang to choose who to be attacker and defender.

:::info Narrative Variant

## The Fall Of Sump City

If players wish, they may use this scenario to represent the fall of Sump City as the Eschers and their allies fight for Sump City against Chaos cultists, corrupted gangs and the beasts of the underhive. Eventually, they are forced to escape onto waiting boats and set off charges in the city’s foundations to sink it.

In order to do this, make the following changes:

- The defender should be a [House Escher](/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-escher/) gang.
- The attacker’s gang is made up of a mix of [Helot Chaos Cults](/docs/gangs/gang-lists/helot-chaos-cult/), [Corpse Grinder Cults](/docs/gangs/gang-lists/corpse-grinder-cult/) and [Exotic Beasts](/docs/gangs/gang-additions/exotic-beasts) (Exotic Beasts do not need to have an owner and will operate independently).
- The Endless Hordes rule is in effect (see below).

#### Endless Hordes

In each End phase, any of the attacker’s Gangers, Juves or Exotic Beasts that have been taken Out of
Action return to the battlefield by being placed in base contact with the attacker’s board edge.
