# 94. The Big Score

_Find the mother lode and you can retire to live a life of luxury… just got to hope no one else has the same idea._

In The Big Score scenario, two gangs fight to loot an abandoned settlement whose defences are still active.

:::info Outcast Scenario

While this scenario can be played in any campaign, there are additional effects when played in an Outlander campaign. These are noted throughout this scenario.

#### Phase 1

Double the amount of Materials received as rewards if played in Phase 1.

[View the full page on Outcast Scenarios](/docs/scenarios/outcast-scenarios).

:::

**Source: Book of the Outcast**

## Battlefield

Standard.

Add 4 Prospecting Sites (abouce 4" in size) at least 8" from any battlefield edge.

## Crews

- Custom (10).

## Tactics Cards

- Custom (2).
- **Underdog** (starting crew cost): +1 random per 100 credits.

## Deployment

Standard.

After deployment, take turns (starting with the gang with Priority) for each of the following steps:

- Place 6 loot caskets within 6" of the centre (one at a time).
- Place 6 defences anywhere (one at a time).

:::note What are defenses?

Defenses are ambiguous in Book of the Outcast, and this scenario refers to the following excerpt on terrain.

> In the outlands, defences are even more important than in the rest of the underhive.
>
> Places such as Dust Falls, or even Sump City, survive by constant connection to the rest of the hive and the nominal protection of the Palanite Enforcers and Clan Houses.
>
> Not so the settlements deep in the badzones, who must endure on their own. Wallsare perhaps the most important component of their defences, as a simple three-metre tall fence around your settlement can be enough to keep most critters from wandering in – or at least give the inhabitants time to shoot them in the head before they do.
>
> For the more security conscious, towers, gates, sentry guns, minefields and guard beasts are all options, and few settlements thrive for long without at least a few of these.

It is up to players to interpret this how they like. Defenses could be [booby traps](/docs/battlefield-setup/scenario-rules#booby-traps--frag-gas-and-melta), [watchtowers](/docs/battlefield-setup/special-terrian-features/special-terrain#watchtower), or even defence servitors.
