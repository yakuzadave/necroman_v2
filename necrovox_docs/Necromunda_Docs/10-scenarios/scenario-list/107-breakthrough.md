## Attacker & Defender

Tie-breaker for determining the attacker:

1. Only gang with vehicles.
2. Gang who chose the scenario.
3. Roll-off (the winner can choose attacker/defender).

The other gang is the defender.

## Battlefield

Standard (Ash Wastes & Rolling Roads) with the following exceptions:

- Roughly 4'x4'.
- Mark a road (6"-8" wide) along the centre of the battlefield.
- Defender: Set up a roadblock within 12" of the centre of the battlefield (across the road), using barricades and defensible positions.

## Crews

- **Attacker:** Custom (6).
- **Defender:** Random (D3+1) + Reinforcements.

Vehicles can be included.

## Tactics Cards

- Custom (2).
- **Underdog** (Gang Rating): +1 random per 100 credits.

## Deployment

1. **Defender:** Anywhere within 12" of the centre.
2. **Attacker:** Within 3" of the Trailing Edge.

## Rolling Roads

_One gang tries to force its way past a roadblock thrown up by their enemies._

This battle starts as an Ash Wastes battle.

At the start of each round (before determining Priority), if an attacker is closer to the Leading Edge than the Trailing Edge, the battle becomes a Rolling Roads battle with open sides:

- Models moving off the sides are Left Behind (can Rejoin later).

## Reinforcements

- Defender: 1 (random).
- Start of each End phase.
- Within 1" of a battlefield side and outside 12" of enemies (deployed by the controlling gang).

## Ending the Battle

The battle ends if any of the following are true:

- 4 rounds after the battle becomes Rolling Road.
- Max 1 gang has models remaining (at the end of a round).

## Victory

The last remaining gang is the winner. Otherwise it is a draw.
