## Attacker And Defender

In this scenario, one gang is the attacker and the other
is the defender. If this scenario is being played as part
of a campaign, then the gang that issued the challenge
is the attacker; otherwise, roll off with the winner
deciding whether they will attack or defend.

## Battle Type

This scenario is an Underhive battle; vehicles and
wargear that grant the Mounted condition cannot be
included in either gang’s starting crew.

## Battlefield

This scenario uses the standard rules for setting up
a battlefield, as described in the [Battlefield Set-up & Scenarios section](/docs/battlefield-setup/battlefield-set-up).

## Crews

This scenario uses the standard rules for choosing a
crew, as described in the [Scenario Rules: Choose Crew section](/docs/battlefield-setup/scenario-rules). Both gangs use the Custom
Selection (6) method to determine their crew.

## Deployment

The defender splits their fighters into as many groups
as they wish, each containing at least two fighters.
They then choose one group and set it up within 2" of
the centre of the battlefield.

The attacker then sets up their entire crew within 6" of
any battlefield edge.

Finally, the defender sets up the rest of their crew.
First they nominate a group, then roll a D6. On a 1-5,
the fighters in that group must be set up within 2"
of the fighters already deployed in the centre of
the battlefield. On a roll of 6, they may be set up
anywhere on the battlefield that is not within 2" of an
enemy fighter.

## Gang Tactics

This scenario uses the standard rules for gang tactics
as described in [Scenario Rules: Gang Tactics](/docs/battlefield-setup/scenario-rules#gang-tactics).

## Ending The Battle

If either gang has no fighters left on the battlefield at
the end of any round, the battle ends immediately and
the other gang scores D3 bonus Victory Points.

## Victory

If one gang has scored more Victory Points than the
other at the end of the battle, they are victorious.
If both gangs have scored the same number of points,
the battle ends in a draw.

## Rewards

#### Credits

The victorious gang adds D6x10 credits to their Stash.
The losing gang adds D3x10 credits to their Stash.
In the case of a draw, both gangs add D6x10 credits to
their Stash.

#### Experience

The Leader of the victorious gang earns D3 XP
(regardless of whether they took part in the battle
or not).

#### Reputation

The winner gains D3 Reputation.
If either gang bottled out, they lose 1 Reputation.

## Home Turf Advantage

The defender has the Home Turf Advantage as
described in [Scenario Rules: Gang Tactics](/docs/battlefield-setup/scenario-rules#gang-tactics).

## Decimate The Opposition

Both gangs score Victory Points for each enemy fighter
that they take Out of Action; three for a Leader, two for
a Champion and one for any other fighter.

## Surprise Attack

Instead of rolling for Priority in the first round, the
defender rolls a D6, adding 1 to the result for each
fighter they were able to set up outside the centre of
the battlefield. If the result is 7 or higher, the defender
takes Priority in the first round. Otherwise, the
attacker takes Priority in the first round instead.

Additionally, during the first round, make a Cool test
for each fighter when they are activated. If the test
is failed, the fighter can only make one action in this
round, instead of two.

_Although gangs usually prefer a fair fight, there are times when an enemy just needs takingdown…_

<h2>Attacker & Defender</h2>

The gang who chose this scenario is the attacker, the other is the defender. Otherwise, randomize one gang to choose who to be attacker and defender.

<h2>Battlefield</h2>

The defender places the first tile. This tile marks the centre of the battlefield. Then take turns placing 4 more tiles, 2 each, adjacent to the first tile, forming a cross. The defender may place all the barricades.

<h2>Crews</h2>

- Custom (10)

<h2>Tactics Cards</h2>

- Custom (2).
- Underdog (starting crew cost): +1 random per 100 credits.

<h2>Deployment</h2>

The defender divides the crew into 2 or more groups. The defender then chooses one group and set up a fighter from that group in the centre of the central tile, then sets up the rest of the fighters in that group within 2” of the first fighter.

Then the attacker sets up their entire crew within 6” of the edge of the outer tiles, however they wish.

Finally, the defender set up the rest of their crew. Roll a D6 for each group. On a 6, they may be set up anywhere on the battlefield, at least 2” from an enemy fighter. Otherwise they must set up within 2” of the fighters already deployed in the central tile.

<h2>Surprise Attack</h2>

The defender rolls a D6, adding 1 to the result for each fighter they were able to set up outside their deployment zone. On a 7+, the defender automatically takes Priority in the first round. Otherwise, the attacker takes Priority.

During the first round, make a Cool test for each fighter when they are activated. If failed, the fighter can only make one action this round instead of two.

<h2>Objectives</h2>

Take out as many of the enemy as possible! Each gang scores points for each enemy fighter that goes Out of Action or flees:

- 3 points for a Leader
- 2 points per Champion
- 1 point for any other fighter
- D3 points for being the last gang on the battlefield.

:::note
The points rarely makes a difference. It’s mainly about being the last gang standing. Presumably fleeing fighters count as OoA (universal rule) since anything else is not spelled out.

:::

<h2>Ending the Battle</h2>

The battle ends when only one gang has fighters remaining (at the end of a round).

<h2>Victory</h2>

The gang that scored the most points is the winner. Otherwise it is a draw.

<h2>Rewards</h2>

#### Credits

- +D6x10 to the winner.
- +D3x5 to the loser.
- +D3x10 to both gangs in case of a draw.

#### Experience

Scenario specific rewards:

- +1 for taking part.
- +1 to the winning Leader (regardless of whether they took part in the battle or not). In case of a draw, neither Leader gets this bonus.

Standard rewards:

- +1 for taking an enemy Out of Action.
- +1 for taking an enemy Leader or Champion Out of Action.
- +1 for killing an enemy (during the battle).
- +1 for Rallying.

#### Reputation

- +2 to the winner.
- +1 to both gangs if this was the first battle against each other.
- -1 to any gang that bottled out.
