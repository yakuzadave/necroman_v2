# 25. Claim the Spire

_Two gangs seek to seize the spires of the Underhive. Soon both gangs become embroiled in a fight across towers and gangways, all in order to claim victory and proclaim their house as Lord of the Spires._

**Source: White Dwarf, January 2018**

## Battlefield

Lay out the terrain so that it creates a series of large spires and tall structures close to the centre of the board. Each spire should have plenty of levels for gangers to fight upon as well as a series of walkways linking them to each other. Scatter terrain is still placed as normal.

## Crews

- Custom.

## Tactics Cards

- Frag Trap, Blood Dept & Last Gasp.

## Deployment

Standard.

## Objectives

Each gang is trying to claim the highest ground they can, whilst also inflicting heavy losses upon their rival gang. At the end of each turn, the gang with the highest-placed model scores 1 point (if both gangs are tied then they each score 1 point). Additionally, each gang scores 1 point for each enemy ganger that goes Out of Action.

## Ending the Battle

The battle ends when only one gang has fighters remaining.

Additionally, if a gang Bottles Out, the battle also ends on a 4+ at the end of the following round. Otherwise, roll again at the end of each subsequent round, adding 1 to the result for each additional time this roll is made; in other words, the second time this roll is made, the battle will end on a 3+ and so on.

## Victory

If only one gang has fighters remaining at the end of the battle, they are victorious. Otherwise, at the end of the battle, whichever gang has scored the most points is declared the winner.

## Infiltrate
**Problem:** Infiltrate can be imbalanced or break this scenario.

**Solution:** If at least one player wants, Infiltrate can't be used in this scenario. Instead, Infiltrating fighters can make 1 or 2 move actions before the first round.
