# 53. Urban Renewal

_Bring it down!_

**Source: Book of Ruin**

## Battlefield

Standard. Additionally, set up a large piece of terrain (the Structure) in the centre of the battlefield.

## Crews

- Custom (6).

## Tactics Cards

- Custom (2).
- Underdog (starting crew cost): +1 random per 100 credits.

## Deployment

Standard.

## Destructible Terrain

_The gangs are attempting to be the first to bring down a dome by destroying a key structure, ideally while causing lots of damage to the rivals. Once destroyed, the dome will start to collapse and the fighters must run for their lives!_

The Structure can be attacked:

- Ranged: Within 12”.
- Close combat: Auto hit.
- Toughness 9
- 10 Wounds.

When losing the last wound, it is destroyed and removed.

In the End phase after being destroyed, apply the following effect for the area within 6” of the centre of the battlefield:

- Impassable terrain.
- Fighters are removed and suffer an Injury roll.

In each subsequent End phase, increase the radius by 6” until the entire battlefield is impassable.

Once destroyed, fighters can escape via any edge, counting as Out of Action without suffering any Lasting Injuries.

## Collateral Damage

_Each time the Structure takes damage, the whole battlefield shudders and debris rains down from above._

When the Structure is damaged, all fighters must pass an Initiative test or become pinned (potentially falling if within 1” of a ledge). If a 1 is rolled (before modifiers), the fighter takes a Strength 3 hit.

## Ending the Battle

The battle ends when at least one of the following is true:

- Only one gang has fighters remaining (at the start of a round).
- The entire battlefield is impassable.

## Victory

The winner is the gang which completed the following objectives:

- Inflicted at least 1 damage on the Structure.
- Most fighters escape the battlefield.

Tie breaker:

- Most damage to the structure.

Otherwise:

- Draw.

## Rewards

#### Experience

Scenario specific rewards:

- +1 for taking part.
- +1 for damaging the Structure.
- +1 for escaping.

Standard rewards:

- +1 for taking an enemy Out of Action.
- +1 for taking an enemy Leader or Champion Out of Action.
- +1 for killing an enemy (during the battle).
- +1 for Rallying.

#### Reputation
