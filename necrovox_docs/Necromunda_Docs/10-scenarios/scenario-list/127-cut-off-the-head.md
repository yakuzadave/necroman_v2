**Source: Apocrypha: Daemons of Meridian**

## Attacker & Defender

The gang who chose this scenario is the attacker, the other is the defender. Otherwise, randomize one gang to choose who to be attacker and defender.

## Battlefield

Standard (Sector Mechanicus).

## Crews

- **Attacker:** Custom (6).
- **Defender:** Random (D3+5)

No vehicles or mounts.

## Tactics Cards

- Custom (2).
- **Underdog** (Gang Rating): +1 random per 100 credits.

## Deployment

1. Defender deploys all with 9" of the centre of the battlefield.
2. Attacker deploys all within 3" of any battlefield edge.

## Home Turf Advantage

- Defender:
  - Bottle tests: Roll 2D6 and discard the highest.
  - Rally tests: +1.
  - Hangers-on: Included in the crew on a 4+ (roll individually).

## The Target

After starting crews have been determined,
the defender designates one of their fighters as
the Target. If possible the defender must choose
their Leader, if their Leader is not part of their
starting crew they must instead select a Champion.
If they cannot select a Champion then any fighter
may be selected. The Target may perform the Power
Tap (Double) action if they are within 3" of the
centre of the battlefield:

**Power Tap (Double):** The fighter removes all Flesh
Wounds and the fighter may perform an additional
action during their next activation.

## Fleeing The Battlefield

If either gang voluntarily bottles out and subsequently
flees the battlefield, their opponent automatically
wins the scenario.

## Ending the Battle

The battle ends if any of the following is true:

- Only one gang remains.
- Target is no longer on the battlefield (end of that round).

## Victory

If the Target is not on the battlefield at the end of
the battle, the attacker is victorious, otherwise the
defender wins.

:::info Narrative Variant

## Daemons Of Meridian

If players wish, they may use this scenario to
represent the battle between Gorshiv and Czarn
in the caves beneath Cinderak City.

In order to do this, make the following changes:

- The attacker’s gang should be a Goliath gang and include [Gorshiv Hammerfist](/docs/gangs/gang-additions/hired-guns/bounty-hunters/#gorshiv-hammerfist).
- The defender’s gang should be an Outcasts gang led by [Czarn the Cyberoth](/docs/gangs/gang-additions/hired-guns/outlaw-bounty-hunters#czarn-the-cyberoth-outlaw-outcasts-leader).
- Czarn must be the Target and he treats the Power Tap (Double) action as a Basic action.
