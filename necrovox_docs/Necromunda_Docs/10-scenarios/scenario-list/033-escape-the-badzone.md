# 33. Escape the Badzone

_Two crews must escape the Badzone._

**Source: Book of Peril**

## Battlefield

Standard. After setting up terrain, take turns placing 4 loot caskets anywhere at least 8” from any edge.

## Crews

- Custom (10).

## Tactics Cards

- Custom (2).
- Underdog (starting crew cost): +1 random per 100 credits.

## Deployment

Standard.

## Special Rule: A Path to Safety

Both gangs are attempting to find a path through the Badzone, while stopping others from doing the same. Each gang must get its fighters off the board edge closest to their opponent’s deployment area.

Any fighters that are not Engaged and within 1” of the opponent’s board edge may escape in the End phase. Loot caskets within 1” of an escaping fighter may be secured. Fighters removed in this way are ignored for the purposes of Bottle tests (not counting as part of the crew size nor as Out of Action).

#### Special Rule: Dangerous Ground

The battle is taking place in an especially hostile Badzone. Discard Badzone Events each round, even if their Discard Trigger is not rolled.

:::info Choose Events
Take control of the Environment and Events. A neutral part or a winner of a roll-off can choose which Environment to use, which Event to start with or which Event to use next.

## Ending the Battle

The battle ends when only one gang has remaining (at the end of a round).

If only one gang bottles out and flees, the opponent’s remaining fighters count as having escaped.

## Victory

The gang with the most escaped fighters is victorious. If both gangs had an equal amount of escaped fighters, it is a draw.

## Rewards

#### Credits

- 2D6x10 per loot casket carried off the board.

#### Experience

- +1 for taking part.
