:::info Gang Raid

Gang Raids scenarios are designed to be shorter than standard games and have some limitations and exceptions to the normal rules:

- No Leaders, Hangers-on, Brutes or Hired Guns.
- Max 1 Champion.
- No Resource at stake.
- No Infiltrate.
- No Loot caskets (unless otherwise stated).

#### Bottle Tests

D3 + Seriously Injured + Out of Action > starting crew

## Battlefield

Standard: 7 tiles (3x2 rectangle + Stash Vault).
The defender places the last tile marked with an ‘X’. This is the Stash Vault (where the defender keeps the stash). The short edge on the opposite side of the Stash Vault is the escape route.

```
[ ][ ][ ][X]
[ ][ ][ ]
```

Alternatively, if playing on Sector Mechanicus terrain, limit the play area to 2" x 4", with the stash on one short edge and the escape route on the other.

## Crews

- **Attacker:** Custom (3).
- **Defender:** Random (3) + Random Reinforcement (3).

## Home Turf Advantage

Defender:

- Bottle tests: Roll 2D6 and discard the highest.
- Rally tests: +1.

## Tactics Cards

- **Attacker:** Custom (2).
- **Defender:** Random (2).
- **Underdog** (starting crew cost): Random(1) per 100 credits.

## Deployment

1. **Attacker:** Entire crew in the Stash Vault. One fighter is given the Stash marker.
1. **Defender:** More than 6” from any enemies.

## Objectives

- **Attacker:** Attempting to escape with the pilfered loot.
- **Defender:** Stop the attackers.

## Reinforcements

- Defender: 3 (all).
- Start of the 4th End phase.
- Within 1" of the escape round and at least 2" from enemies (deployed by the controlling gang).

## Claiming The Stash And Escaping

Any attackers (regardless of statuses or conditions) can escape the battlefield in the End phase if within 1” of an Escape Route (counting as Out of Action for the purposes of Bottle tests).

If the Stash marker is within 1” of the escape route when a fighter escapes, it is claimed and removed from the battlefield.

## Go Through Them

The attacker does not take Bottle tests and can't voluntarily flee the battlefield.

## Fleeing The Battlefield

If the defender bottles out and flees the battlefield, the attacker automatically wins and claims the Stash marker.

## Ending the Battle

The battle ends when only one gang has fighters remaining (at the end of a round).

## Victory

The attacker wins if at least 1 fighter has escaped and the Stash marker is claimed. Otherwise, the defender wins.

## Rewards

#### Credits

- D6x10 to the attacker for winning.

#### Experience

Scenario specific rewards:

- +1 for taking part.
- +1 to the winning Leader (regardless of whether they took part in the battle or not).

Standard rewards:

- +1 for taking an enemy Out of Action.
- +1 for taking an enemy Leader or Champion Out of Action.
- +1 for killing an enemy (during the battle).
- +1 for Rallying.

#### Reputation

- +2 to the attacker for winning.
- +D3+1 to the defender for winning.
- -1 for bottling out.
