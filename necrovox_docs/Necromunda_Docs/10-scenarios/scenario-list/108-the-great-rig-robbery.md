# 108. The Great Rig Robbery

_"Escort Epsilon-Gamma come in, we are under attack, requesting immediate back-up. Repeat: Escort Epsilon-Gammaâ€¦"_  
\- Hark Gruner, Cargo-8 Ridgehauler Driver, Guild of Coin

In this scenario, two gangs fight over a lone cargo hauler, trying to claim its riches before its escorts turn up.

## Battlefield

Standard (Ash Wastes & Rolling Roads) with the following exceptions:

- Mark a road (6"-8" wide) along the centre of the battlefield.
- No terrain can be placed on the road.
- Place a large vehicle (High Value Cargo) in the centre of the battlefield, facing directly towards the Leading Edge.

## Crews

- Custom (7).

Vehicles can be included.

## Tactics Cards

- Custom (2).
- **Underdog** (Starting crew cost): +1 random per 100 credits.

## Deployment

The deployment zones are 6" from each opposite battlefield edge (not Trailing or Leading Edge).

The winner of a roll-off chooses one side (not Trailing or Leading Edge), the loser has the opposite side.

Alternate placing the crew one model at a time, starting with the gang that won the roll-off.

## Rolling Roads

Open sides:
Models moving off the sides are Left Behind (can Rejoin later).

#### High Speed Pursuit

_This scenario happens at high speed with the High Value Cargo attempting to shake off both gangs. _

During the Move Battlefield step of the Rolling Roads phase, any vehicles that have at least half of the Leading Edge within the front vision arc are not moved towards the Trailing Edge with the rest of the battlefield.

This may result in those vehicles colliding with other models or terrain (resolved as normal).

#### Implacable Advance

Note that the High Value Cargo remains on the centre of the battlefield (cannot be moved).

#### Clear Road

No terrain can be placed on the road.

## High Value Cargo

_Both gangs are trying to loot what they can from a passing vehicle before its escorts arrive. The High Value Cargo attempts to shake off both gangs while voxxing in for support._

Use a large vehicle (for example the Ridgehauler) as the main objective for this battle:

- Cannot be targeted by attacks.
- Remains on the centre of the battlefield (cannot be moved).
- Treated as solid terrain.
- Fighters within 1" can spend a Basic action (Loot Cargo) and pass an Intelligence test to gain 1 Cargo point.

#### Escort Incoming

Starting on the 3rd round (and each subsequent round), roll a D6 + Round number. If the result is 9+, this is the last round of the battle (before the escort arrives and the gangs scatter).

## Ending the Battle

The battle ends if any of the following are true:

- High Value Cargo's escorts arrive.
- Max 1 gang has models remaining (at the end of a round).

## Victory

The gang with the most Cargo points is the winner. Otherwise it is a draw.

## Rewards

#### Credits

- D6x10 per Cargo point.

#### Experience

Scenario specific rewards:

- +1 for taking part.
- +1 for gaining at least one Cargo point.

Standard rewards:

- +1 for taking an enemy Out of Action.
- +1 for taking an enemy Leader or Champion Out of Action.
- +1 for killing an enemy (during the battle).
- +1 for Rallying.

#### Reputation

- +D3 (win).
- -1 (bottle out).
