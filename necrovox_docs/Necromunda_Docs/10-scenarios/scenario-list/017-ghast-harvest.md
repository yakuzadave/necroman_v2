# 17. Ghast Harvest

## Battle Type

This scenario is an Underhive battle; vehicles and
wargear that grant the Mounted condition cannot be
included in either gang’s starting crew.

## Battlefield

This scenario uses the standard rules for setting up
a battlefield, as described in the [Battlefield Set-up & Scenarios section](/docs/battlefield-setup/battlefield-set-up).

## Crews

This scenario uses the standard rules for choosing a
crew, as described in the [Scenario Rules: Choose Crew section](/docs/battlefield-setup/scenario-rules). Both gangs use the Custom
Selection (D3+4) method to determine their crew.

## Deployment

This scenario uses the standard rules for deployment
as described in [Scenario Rules: Gang Tactics](/docs/battlefield-setup/scenario-rules#gang-tactics).

## Gang Tactics

Each player randomly generates two gang tactics.
When playing these gang tactics, the player rolls a
D6. On a 4+, the gang tactic takes effect as normal;
otherwise it has no effect, is discarded, and the player
randomly generates another gang tactic to replace it.

## Ending The Battle

If either gang has no fighters left on the battlefield at
the end of any round, the battle ends immediately.

## Victory

The gang with the most Loot markers at the end of the
battle is the winner – otherwise the game is a draw.

## Rewards

#### Credits

Each gang adds D6x10 credits to their Stash for each
Loot marker they sell (see Little Bit Off The Top).

#### Experience

A fighter that harvested at least one bag of
unrefined ghast and didn’t go Out of Action earns an
additional 1 XP.

Any fighter that successfully manifests at least one
Wyrd Power earns an additional 1 XP.

#### Reputation

Each gang that took part in the battle gains 1 Reputation.

If a gang successfully harvested five or more bags of
unrefined ghast, they gain an additional 3 Reputation.

## Harvesting Ghast

Something is not quite right about this place. Fighting
in a dome full of unrefined ghast can do weird things
to a fighter, not to mention the dangers of harvesting
it. After setting up the battlefield, players take turns
(starting with the player who has priority) to place four
ghast deposits. A ghast deposit can be represented
using suitable obstacle-sized terrain features. The
entire terrain feature counts as a marker for the
purposes of harvesting.

A Standing and Active fighter that is in base contact
with a ghast deposit may make a Harvest Ghast
(Double) action. Make an Intelligence test for the
fighter – if they pass, place a Loot marker on their
card to represent a bag of unrefined ghast. After
successfully harvesting, roll a D6. On a 6+, the ghast
deposit is exhausted and removed from the battlefield.
If a fighter goes Out of Action, any Loot markers they
have are discarded. No fighter may carry more than
two bags of unrefined ghast.

When a fighter attempts to harvest ghast (whether they
were successful or not), make a Toughness check for
them, adding 2 if they are wearing a respirator. If they
fail, or simply choose to eat some of the unrefined
ghast they are harvesting, roll a D6 on the table below:

| &nbsp;&nbsp;D6&nbsp;&nbsp; | Result                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| :------------------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|            1-3             | **Oh god, oh god, oh god!:** The fighter is activated again immediately, but is controlled by your opponent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|            4-5             | **It’s like the universe is in my mind!:** The fighter becomes a [psyker](/docs/the-rules/psykers) and gains the Non-sanctioned Psyker Special rule for the rest of the battle. They gain a random [Wyrd Power](/docs/the-rules/psykers#wyrd-powers). If they already are a psyker and have a Wyrd Power, this result has no effect.                                                                 |
|             6              | **Today, I am the Emperor!:** The fighter adds 2 to all dice rolls for the remainder of the battle. Additionally, the fighter becomes a [psyker](/docs/the-rules/psykers) and gains the Non-sanctioned Psyker skill for the rest of the battle. They gain a random [Wyrd Power](/docs/the-rules/psykers#wyrd-powers). If they already are a psyker and have a Wyrd Power, this result has no effect. |

## Little Bit Off The Top

At the end of the battle, gangs may choose to sell
any of the ghast they harvested. Alternatively, gangs
may hang onto any or all of their ghast for use in
future battles. For each Loot marker not converted
into credits, add one bag of unrefined ghast to the
gang’s Stash. A bag of unrefined ghast may be given to
any fighter during the Distribute Equipment step of the
post-battle sequence of any battle.

During any activation, a fighter with a bag of unrefined
ghast may consume it as a simple action, rolling on the
Harvesting Ghast table to see what happens.

## Fleeing The Battlefield

If one gang voluntarily bottles out and flees the
battlefield, their opponent automatically wins the
scenario. The winner may place 1 extra Loot counter on
the Fighter card of each fighter in their crew that is not
Prone and Seriously Injured or Out of Action at the end
of the game, without any risk of them being affected
by the unrefined ghast (note that no fighter may carry
more than two Loot markers).

## Arbitrating the Scenario

The Arbitrator can add defences, sentries and
locked doors to the scenario, so that the area
represents one of Lord Helmawr’s ghast farms.
The Arbitrator should place the ghast deposits
and may place more than four, making sure to put
them behind locked doors. Appropriate models can
then be set up to represent point defence turrets
– count these as either heavy stubbers or heavy
bolters with BS 5+, T5 and 2 Wounds. Defence
turrets have the Overwatch skill and always count
as being Standing and Active and subject to the
Ready condition.

Sentries can be added, either pitting the
Arbitrator’s watchmen against a single gang, or
as an additional challenge for the fighting gangs.
This allows the Arbitrator to set up using the Sneak
Attack rules.
