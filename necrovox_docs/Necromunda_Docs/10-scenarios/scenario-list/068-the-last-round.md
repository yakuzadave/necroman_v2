# 68. The Last Round

_A powerful gang celebrates their final victory at a local drinking hole - only to discover the fight is not over yet..._

:::note Multi-player Games

End Game Scenarios work best when they are multi-player games. While it might be appropriate for a single powerful gang to see if they can break free of the underhive, take down the local warlord or escape into the wastes, these games will be more memorable and more exciting if all the players have a stake in the outcome rather than watching from the sidelines. Fortunately, Necromunda is a game that lends itself well to multi-player games, and guidelines for running Necromunda with more than two players can be found in the rules, covering such things as determining Priority when there is more than two players and limiting the number of fighters each player can field in especially large games in order to keep the action moving. The End Game Scenarios presented in this article are all designed witrh multi-player gaming in mind.

:::

## Attacker & Defender

The gang with the highest rating is the defender (in case of a tie, the winner of a roll-off decides). The remaining gangs are the attacker.

This scenario can be fought one-on one, but is intended for one powerful gang to fight against a group of less powerful gangs.

## Battlefield

Standard with the following exceptions (the battle takes place in a drinking hole):

- Centre: An open area roughly 122 wide with a reasonable amount of scatter terrain (represents the taproom).
- Surrounding area: As normal.
- Border between centre and surrounding area: Walls (impassable terrain) with 2+ doors (entrances).

## Crews

- **Defender:** Custom.
- **Attacker** (crew size is per gang):
  - 1-2 attacking gangs: Custom (10).
  - 3 attacking gangs: Custom (7).
  - 4+ attacking gangs: Custom (5).

## Tactics Cards

- Custom (2).

## Deployment

1. **Attacker:** Within 6” of any edge of the battlefield.
2. **Defender:** Within 12” of the centre (taproom).

## Limited Ammo

_A powerful gang celebrates their final victory at a local drinking hole - only to discover the fight is not over yet… The defenders are caught by surprise and only have a limited supply of ammo to hand, and haven’t brought all the firepower._

Apply the following to all weapons carried by defending fighters:

1. Weapons with Limited can't be used.
2. Gain Limited (if Scarce).
3. Gain Scarce (if not having Scarce already).

## On The Clock

_While the defenders are caught unexpected, the attackers can still lose their nerve when trying to take out the toughest gang around._

Starting with the End phase of round 3 (and the End phase of each subsequent round), each gang with a Leader present on the battlefield (not Seriously Injured, Out of Action or Broken) rolls a D6:

- If the defender’s roll is higher than each of the attackers’ rolls (compared individually), all attacking gangs must immediately remove D3 random fighters from the battlefield (lose the nerve and flee).

## Ending the Battle

The battle ends when only one side (attacker or defender) has fighters remaining on the battlefield.

## Victory

The defender wins if at least 1 defending fighter remains on the battlefield (not Seriously Injured) at the end of the battle. Otherwise the attacker wins.

## Outcome

_Win or lose, the glorious run for the most powerful gang in the dome ends here. If the defender wins, enjoy one last round of drinks (over the corpses of the rivals) before disappearing from the sector and into legend. Otherwise, become permanent fixtures of the bar’s decor..._

## Rewards

#### Experience

Scenario specific rewards:

- +1 to each attacking fighter for taking part.

Standard rewards:

- +1 for taking an enemy Out of Action.
- +1 for taking an enemy Leader or Champion Out of Action.
- +1 for killing an enemy (during the battle).
- +1 for Rallying.

#### Reputation

- +1 to each attacking gang.
- +1 to each attacking gang if the defender bottled out.

:::note ALTERNATIVES

The two sides can be rebalanced. Each side can have additional benefits.
**Attackers:**

- Recruit a free Bounty Hunter or Hive Scum.
- An Enforcer patrol can show up to help.
- A Guild entourage can show up to help.
- Modify crew sizes.

**Defender:**

- Set up sentry guns and defences in the bar.
- A friendly Ogryn bouncer.
- The bar could be on fire:
  - -2 hit modifier to all ranged attacks.
  - D3 random fighters on each side must roll against Blaze (4+) or catch fire (as if being hit by a Blaze weapon).

Alternatively, create an attacking gang (Enforcers, outlaws, plague zombies etc.) to fight against all Leaders in the campaign as the defenders.
