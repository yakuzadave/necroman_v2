# 123. The Last Stand (v2)

In this scenario, a desperate gang declares that they will take on all others... to the death!

**Source: White Dwarf 482**

:::info Underdog Scenario

This scenario is designed for an underdog gang to have a high-risk/high-reward opportunity against a considerably stronger enemy:

- At least 400 less Gang Rating than the enemy.
- Can be chosen if the underdog gets to choose the scenario (when rolling to determine which scenario is played).
- Underdog tactics cannot be used in this scenario.
