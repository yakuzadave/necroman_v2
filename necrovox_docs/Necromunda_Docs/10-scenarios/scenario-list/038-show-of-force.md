# 38. Show of Force

_The enemy gang must be crushed without mercy._

**Source: Book of Ruin**

## Attacker & Defender

The gang who chose this scenario is the attacker, the other is the defender. Otherwise, randomize one gang to choose who to be attacker and defender.

## Battlefield

Standard.

## Crews

- **Attacker:** Custom (D3+7) + Reinforcements.
- **Defender:** Random (D3+5).

## Tactics Cards

- Custom (2).
- Underdog (starting crew cost): +1 random per 100 credits.

## Deployment

Standard.

## Shock And Awe

_The attacker is seeking to make an example of the enemy and the best way to do that is with a substantial body count - ideally where their comrades can witness the price of heresy._

Attacker:

- 1 point for taking a defender Out of Action.
- 1 point if friendly fighters are within 6” of another defender taken Out of Action.

## Back Into The Shadows

_The defender has been brought to battle before they are ready and must escape before being wiped out - hopefully taking some of their foes down in the process._

Defender:

- 1 point for taking an attacker Out of Action.
- 1 point for each defender escaping the battlefield. Defenders can escape within 2” of the battlefield edge opposite of the defender’s deployment zone. Escaped fighters do not count as Out of Action, but do also not count as part of the crew when making Bottle tests.

## Reinforcements

- Attacker: 1.
- Each End phase (starting on the 2nd round).

## Ending the Battle

The battle ends when only one gang has fighters remaining.

## Victory

The gang that scored most points is the winner. If equal amount of points:

- Uprising: The gang with Ascendancy (Allegiance) is the winner.
- Otherwise: Draw.
