## Attacker & Defender

The gang who chose this scenario is the attacker, the other is the defender. Otherwise, randomize one gang to choose who to be attacker and defender.

## Battlefield

Zone Mortalis: A maze of corridors and doors. Place a neutral fighter (the assassination target) in the centre of a large room.

The defender decides which doors start locked/unlocked.

## Crews

- **Attacker:** Custom (1). This is the assassin.
- **Defender:** Custom (D3+2 Sentries) + Reinforcements.

No vehicles or mounts.

## Tactics Cards

- Defender: Custom (1).

## Deployment

1. **Defender:** Half the crew (round up) in the room with the assassination target.
2. **Attacker** (the assassin): B2B with any edge and at least 6" from any other fighter.

## The Target

Cannot be activated, become Ready, suffer Lasting Injury or be captured.

## The Assassin

A tooled up assassin filled with stimms tries to take advantage of the confusion of the Great Darkness to eliminate a high ranking rival.

At the start of each round, the assassin gets a number of Ready markers equal to the number of enemy fighters remaining on the battlefield (can activate multiple times, losing one Ready marker after each activation).

Ignore the following:

- Flash, Gas, Toxin,
- Pinned.
- Coup the Grace.

Can be affected by Blaze, but only suffer damage after the first activation with Blaze each round.

When damaged:

- Treat any Out of Action result on the Injury dice as Seriously Injured instead.
- If Seriously Injured, do not make a normal recovery test. Instead, roll equal to or below the Toughness to automatically recover (suffering a Flesh Wound as normal).

When Toughness is reduced to 0:

- Cannot recover.
- Can still make Crawl (Double) action.
- Can be removed with Coup de Grace.

#### Assassinate

If B2B with the target (even if Engaged with other fighters), spend a Double action to kill the target and complete the mission.

## Home Turf Advantage

Defender:

- **Bottle tests:** Roll 2D6 and discard the highest.
- **Rally tests:** +1.
- **Hangers-on:** Included in the crew on a 4+ (roll individually).

## Reinforcements

- Defender: 2.
- Each End phase (starting on the round the alarm is raised).

## Fleeing The Battlefield

If one gang voluntarily bottles out and subsequently flees the battlefield, the opponent automatically wins the scenario.

## Ending the Battle

The battle ends when the assassin is OoA or the target is assassinated.

## Victory

The attacker wins if the target is assassinated.
Otherwise the defender wins.

## Rewards

#### Credits

- Attacker (win): 3D6x10.
- Loser: D6x10.

#### Experience

Scenario specific rewards:

- +1 for taking part.
- +D3 for taking the assassin OoA.

Standard rewards:

- +1 for taking an enemy Out of Action.
- +1 for taking an enemy Leader or Champion Out of Action.
- +1 for killing an enemy (during the battle).
- +1 for Rallying.

#### Reputation

- Defender (win): +D3+1.

:::info Narrative Variant

## Strike At Lord Helmawr

If players wish, they may use this scenario to represent a Murder-cyborg infiltrating the spire in order to take out Lord Helmawr.

In order to do this, make the following changes:

- The defender should use a Palanite Enforcers gang using Patrolmen as the sentries and creating a Reinforcements deck with the rest of their gang.
- The attacker should use the profile of a gang leader with 100 credits of Wargear
  and close combat weapons to represent the Murder-Cyborg.

:::danger House Rule (Necrodamus)

This scenario breaks easily, so be careful with special rules. For example Falsehood, Devout Masses, Infiltrate etc.

The assassin should probably never test to bottle out.
