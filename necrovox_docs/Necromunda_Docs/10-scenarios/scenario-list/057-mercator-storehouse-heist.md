# 57. Mercator Storehouse Heist

_Two gangs send a small infiltration force into a Guild storehouse, intent on claiming a supposedly valuable item destined for auction to the highest bidder._

:::info Gang Raid

Gang Raids scenarios are designed to be shorter than standard games and have some limitations and exceptions to the normal rules:

- No Leaders, Hangers-on, Brutes or Hired Guns.
- Max 1 Champion.
- No Resource at stake.
- No Infiltrate.
- No Loot caskets (unless otherwise stated).

#### Bottle Tests

D3 + Seriously Injured + Out of Action > starting crew

## Battlefield

- Standard: 5.
  The winner of a roll-off places the first tile. This tile marks the centre of the battlefield. Then take turns placing 4 more tiles, 2 each, adjacent to the first tile, forming a cross. There must be a clear route from the centre tile to each battlefield edge furthest from the centre.

Alternatively, if playing on Sector Mechanicus terrain, limit the play area to 3" x 3" and emulate the cross formation, blocking out the corners as impassable.

## Crews

- Custom (4).

## Tactics Cards

- No Cards

## Deployment

1. Place the auction item on the centre.
1. Place the defence servitor within 1” of the centre (winner of a roll-off).
1. The winner of a roll-off selects a deployment zone (3”) and deploys the entire crew. The other team deploys the entire crew in the opposite deployment zone. Take turns selecting a deployment zone (3”) and deploy the entire crew.

## The Auction Item And Escaping

- No fighter can carry the auction item until the defence servitor is Out of Action.
- If within 1” of the auction item, spend a Simple action (Carry) to carry the item.
- A fighter can't use any weapons while carrying the auction item (unless having [Bulging Biceps](/docs/gang-fighters-and-their-weaponry/skills/#2-bulging-biceps)).
- If taken Out of Action while carrying the auction item, leave it where the fighter was.

Any fighters (regardless of statuses or conditions) can escape the battlefield in the End phase if within 1” of an Escape Route (counting as Out of Action for the purposes of Bottle tests).

## Hole In The Wall

Once per game, instead of activating a fighter, each gang can place a ductway anywhere on the battlefield.

</FighterCard>

## Overwatch Routine

The servitor will make Shoot (Basic) actions whenever all of the following are true:

- Not Engaged.
- A fighter ends an activation within LOS of the servitor.
- Passes an Initiative test. This test is automatically passed if at least one of the following is true:
  - The first time each round.
  - The activated fighter made an attack against the servitor.

If Engaged, make Reaction attacks as normal.

## Fleeing The Battlefield

If a gang voluntarily bottles out and flees the battlefield, the remaining gang automatically wins and claims the auction item.

## Ending the Battle

The battle ends when only one gang has fighters remaining (at the end of a round).

## Victory

The gang escaping with the auction item is the winner. Otherwise it is a draw.

## Rewards

#### Rare Goods

The gang that secured the auction item rolls a D66 on the table that follows during the post-battle sequence to see what they have stolen. Any item stolen is immediately added to the gang's stash.
