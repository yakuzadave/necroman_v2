## Attacker & Defender

Tie-breaker for determining the attacker:

1. Highest rating.
2. Roll-off (the winner can choose attacker/defender).

The other gang is the defender.

:::info Outlander Campaign

The gang who issued the challenge is the attacker.

:::

## Battlefield

Divide the battlefield into 2 halves:

- Attacker: Standard.
- Defender: Defender can set up any terrain representing their settlement including a Gang Stronghold.

The defender's half is the settlement being raided.

:::info Outlander Campaign

The defender can set up any and all settlement defences in defender's half of the battlefield. This replaces the default Gang Stronghold.
