# 64. Khimerix Hunt

_Something’s stalking the gang’s turf._

**Source: House of Blades**

:::info Designer's Note: Scrag 'Em All!

While the scenarios presented here have been designed specifically for House
Escher gangs, there is no reason that, with the permission of the Arbitrator, they
might not be used for any gang.

The Khimerix Hunt can make for an interesting
Arbitrated battle, with the Arbitrator taking control of the Khimerix, or perhaps
multiple Khimerix, and having the hunters become the hunted. Back from the
Dead is intended to represent the creation of a Death-maiden, but could equally
represent any ganger abandoned by their comrades fighting to make it back to
their gang hideout.

</WeaponStats>

**Wargear:** Scaly hide (6+, 5+ against Blast/Template, same as: [Flak armour](/docs/armoury/armour#flak)).

#### Regeneration

Unless ablaze, can spend a Simple action (Regeneration) to heal 1 wound on a 4+.

#### Crushing Blow

Nominate one attack (before rolling to hit) to gain +1 S & D (if hitting).

#### Appearance

The Khimerix does not start on the battlefield, but appears after a fighter is injured. Whenever a fighter (in any gang) suffers a Flesh Wound, is Seriously Injured or taken Out of Action, the Khimerix will appear on a 5+.

Each additional time the roll is made in the same round, add 1 to the result. Once the Khimerix has appeared, do not roll for it again to appear this round.

The injured fighter’s gang can place the Khimerix anywhere B2B with the injured fighter, or where the fighter was if taken Out of Action. It then immediately takes an action.

#### Actions

Whenever the Khimerix takes an action, use the following

| Priority | Trigger                    | Action                        |
| :------- | :------------------------- | :---------------------------- |
| 1        | Closest fighter B2B        | Fight (Basic)                 |
| 2        | Closest fighter within 9“  | Charge (Double)               |
| 3        | Closest fighter within 12“ | Move (Simple) + Shoot (Basic) |
| 4        | Khimerix wounded           | Regeneration (Simple)         |
| 5        | None of the above          | Return to the Shadows         |

The Khimerix will always target the closest fighter with its attacks. If 2 fighters are equally distant, then randomly determine the target.

</FighterCard>

#### Back to the Shadows

If in B2B with a Seriously Injured fighter in the End phase and no other fighters within 6” of the Khimerix, it will:

- Drag its prey off into the shadows (counts as going Out of Action).
- Removing itself from the battlefield.

If wounded by an attack, after making a save (if any), but before applying the damage, the Khimerix will make an Initiative test. If passed:

- Only suffer a single wound.
- Ignore any weapon traits of the attack.
- Removing itself from the battlefield.

In both cases, it will not appear again this round, but may appear in later rounds (as detailed above).

## Bigger Problems

Fighters can only choose the Khimerix as a target while within 12” of it.

## Ending the Battle

The battle ends when one of the following is true:

- Only one gang has fighters remaining.
- The Khimerix is taken Out of Action.

## Victory

The gang that took the Khimerix Out of Action is the winner. Otherwise it is a draw.

## Rewards

- 2D6x10 to the winning gang.

- +1 for taking part.
