# 51. Daemonic Possession

_A Daemon is loose within the hive._

**Source: Book of Ruin**

## Battlefield

Standard.

## Crews

- Random (6)

## Tactics Cards

- Custom (2).
- Underdog (lowest Gang Rating): Random (1).

## Deployment

Standard.

## The Daemon

_A fighter is secretly harbouring a daemonic entity that will manifest fully and take possession of that fighter, before leaping from fighter to fighter to spread havoc and evade destruction._

Before deployment, decide who has a Daemon within the crew:

1. Randomize a gang.
2. Randomize a fighter in that gang.

Roll a D6 in each End phase. The Daemon manifests and takes possession of the fighter on a 5+. If the Daemon has already manifested, it will leap to another fighter. The next target is the closest Standing fighter (randomize if there are multiple fighters equally close). After the leap, the previous host gains Insanity.

## Possessed Fighters

- +3 Strength, Move, Attacks and Willpower.
- Can't use ranged weapons.
- Becomes an Unsanctioned Psyker.
- Have Scouring (Basic) Pyromancy Wyrd Power
- (same as: Psychic Vomit):
  - Str 2, AP -2, D 1, Blaze, Template
- Automatically passes any Cool tests.
- Can't be Pinned.
- If Seriously Injured or taken Out of Action, leap to another fighter.

#### Creature Of The Warp

When rolling on the Perils of the Warp table, treat Daemonic Possession (11-12) as Warp Surge! (9-10). The fighter is already possessed, so can't be possessed again.

#### Underhive Exorcism

The Daemon is exorcised on a 5+ if:

- Seriously Injured or taken Out of Action by a Melee weapon.
- Coup de Grace.

Otherwise, it leaps to the next target.

## Blood For The Warp

- 1 point per enemy taken Out of Action by the possessed fighter (to the gang controlling it).
- 6 points to the gang exorcing the Daemon.

## Ending the Battle

The battle ends when at least one of the following is true:

- Only one gang has fighters remaining (at the end of a round).
- Underhive Exorcism is performed.

## Victory

The gang that scored most points is the winner. If the score is equal, the gang with the most remaining fighters is the winner.

## Rewards

#### Experience

Scenario specific rewards:

- +1 for taking part.
- +D3 if possessed at the end of the battle.
- +D6 for destroying the Daemon.

Standard rewards:

- +1 for taking an enemy Out of Action.
- +1 for taking an enemy Leader or Champion Out of Action.
- +1 for killing an enemy (during the battle).
- +1 for Rallying.

#### Reputation

- +D3 for winning.
- -1 to any gang that bottled out.

:::danger House Rule (Necrodamus)

For simplicity, Psychic Vomit (Basic) is treated like Scouring (Basic), as it has the same effect. At least as far as anything can have the same effect as Scouring, including Scouring itself, since there are already so many versions of this weapon profile.
