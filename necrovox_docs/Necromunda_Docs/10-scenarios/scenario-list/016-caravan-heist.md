# 16. Caravant Heist

_A gang makes a daring raid against a Guilder caravan._

_Source: Necromunda 2018 Rulebook_  

## Attacker & Defender

The gang who chose this scenario is the attacker, the other is the defender. Otherwise, randomize one gang to choose who to be attacker and defender.

## Battlefield

Standard. However, the battlefield must be set up in such a way that the caravan can travel across the battlefield without structures or impassable terrain blocking its path.

## Crews

- Custom (10).

## Tactics Cards

- Custom (2).
- Underdog (starting crew cost): +1 random per 100 credits.

## Deployment

The defender deploys first, placing the caravan so that it is touching one of the edges of the battlefield. Then place the crew so that they are on on or within 12” of the caravan. The attacker then sets up their fighters within 6” of any board edge except the one with the caravan.

## Special Rule: The Caravan

Use a suitable vehicle or marker to represent the caravan. At the start of each round, before rolling for Priority, the defender moves the caravan 6” toward the table edge opposite its starting position. The caravan must avoid impassable terrain and stay on ground level, but is otherwise not stopped by anything. Fighters on the caravan are moved with it. Fighters in its path are moved the minimum distance necessary to avoid the caravan’s advance. Any barricades, loot caskets, ammo crates or small pieces of terrain that are run over by the caravan are removed.

The caravan can't be attacked, blocks line of sight and provides partial cover to fighters riding on it.

:::info EMBARK / DISEMBARK (SIMPLE)
Spend a Simple action (Embark / Disembark) to climb onto, or off, the caravan.
:::

:::info LOOT CARAVAN (SIMPLE)

If Active and within 1" of the caravan, spend a Simple action (Loot Caravan) to gain a Loot counter.

:::

If an attacking fighter goes Out of Action, any Loot they have are discarded.

#### Designer's Note

If there are weapons modelled on the caravan, fighters riding it can operate them by taking a Shoot action. Ignore the Unwieldy trait for mounted weapons.

## Special Rule: Guilder Hired Guns

As Guild appointed protectors, the defender’s gang wouldn’t dare run off, and so need not take Bottle tests for this scenario. They can however voluntarily bottle out and flee the battlefield.

Additionally, if (due to injuries) the defender has insufficient fighters to field the max crew size, Hive Scum may be hired free of charge to even the odds.

## Fleeing the Battlefield

If a gang voluntarily bottles out and flees the battlefield, their opponent automatically wins the scenario. If the attacker wins this way, place D3 extra Loot counters on each fighter in the crew not Prone and Seriously Injured or Out of Action at the end of the battle.

## Ending the Battle

The battle ends when at least 1 condition is true:

- Only one gang has fighters remaining (at the end of a round).
- The caravan reaches the far battlefield edge.

## Victory

The attacker wins if they can gather 10 Loot counters, otherwise the defender is the winner.

## Rewards

#### Credits

- D6x10 per Loot counter the attacker got on fighters that didn’t go Out of Action, but including those that fled.
- D6x10 to the defender.
- 3D6x10 to the defender if the attacker recovered less than 5 Loot counters.

#### Experience

Scenario specific rewards:

- +1 for taking part.
- +1 to attacking fighters that didn’t go Out of Action and gathered a Loot counter.
- +1 to defending fighters for taking an enemy carrying one or more Loot counter Out of Action.

Standard rewards:

- +1 for taking an enemy Out of Action.
- +1 for taking an enemy Leader or Champion Out of Action.
- +1 for killing an enemy (during the battle).
- +1 for Rallying.

#### Reputation

- +1 to each gang that took part in the battle.
- +D3+1 to winning attacker (10 or more Loot counters).
- +D3+1 to winning defender (the caravan reached the far table edge without the attacker recovinger 10 or more Loot counters).

:::note Alternative Variant

A Dome Runner might be one of the defenders, or maybe leading the way for the caravan to make sure it has a clear path.
