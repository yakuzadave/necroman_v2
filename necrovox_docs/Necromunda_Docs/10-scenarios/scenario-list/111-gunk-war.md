:::info Narrative Variant

## The Defence of Two Tunnels

If players wish they may use this scenario to represent the defence of Two Tunnels as Corpse Grinder Cults invade the settlement, attempting to consume all within it. The Gunk Queen and her brother desperately attempt to defend the industrial gunkworks by flooding the surrounding streets with gunk and setting it alight!

In order to do this, make the following changes:

- The defender takes an Outcast gang which must include [Gaen ‘The Gunk Queen’ Gorvos](/docs/gangs/gang-additions/hired-guns/hive-scum#gaen-gorvos) as its Leader and [Vunder Gorvos](/docs/gangs/gang-additions/hired-guns/hive-scum#vunder-gorvos) as a Champion.
- The attacker takes a [Corpse Grinder](/docs/gangs/gang-lists/corpse-grinder-cult/) gang.
