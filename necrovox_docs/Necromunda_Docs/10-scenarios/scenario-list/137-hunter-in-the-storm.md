# 137. Hunter in the Storm

_“It’s like the storm just came alive and took him!”_  
\- Baery the Half-bald, Corpse Wardens, House Cawdor

In this scenario, two gangs fight it out in the midst of a raging storm, while an unseen hunter strikes from
the gloom.

**Source: Apocrypha: Halfway Dead**

## Attacker & Defender

- One gang is the attacker, all others are the defender.
- The gang who chose this scenario is the attacker, the others are the defender. Otherwise, randomize one gang to choose who to be attacker and defender.

## Battlefield

Standard (Ash Wastes), recommended 4'x4'.

## Crews

- Custom (10).
- Attacker designates a Hunter who needs to be a leader or a champion.

No vehicles or mounts.

## Tactics Cards

- Custom (2).
- **Underdog** (**Crew** Rating): +1 random per 100 credits.

## Deployment

1. Defenders deploy within 12" of the centre of the battlefield, 3" away from another fighter.
   - Start with the highest credit cost fighter.
2. Attacker then deploys anywhere on the battlefield, within 6" of a battlefield edge. The Hunter _is not_ deployed.

## The Hunter

_The attackers are being led by a skilled and ruthless hunter. While their gang keeps the defenders busy, they stalk through the storm personally killing as many of the foe as possible._

Though the Hunter is not deployed on the battlefield, give them a Ready marker
at the start of each round. When they activate, the
Hunter can be placed anywhere on the battlefield
provided they are either out of line of sight, or at least
X" away from all defenders, where X" is equal to the
current Visibility (X") rule. 

In each End phase, remove the Hunter from the battlefield. If the Hunter was Seriously Injured when they were
removed from the battlefield, they are considered to
have recovered with a Flesh Wound.

## Storm Winds

_As the battle progresses the storm rapidly passes over the settlement, turning day into murky twilight._

The Visibility (24") rule is in effect at the start of the
battle. At the beginning of each round after the first,
reduce the visibility by 6", to a minimum of 6".

## Desperate Defence

_The defenders are well-aware what will happen if they surrender, and cut off in the middle of the wasteland there’s nowhere for them to run._

In this scenario the defending gang does not need to make Bottle checks.                                                                                                  

## Ending the Battle

- At the end of a round if the Hunter has been taken Out of Action.
- , if The battle ends when only one gang has fighters remaining.

## Victory

- If the defender took out the Hunter, they win
- Otherwise if the Hunter took at least half the defender's crew Out of Action
- Otherwise it's a draw.

:::info Narrative Variant

## Shootout in Halfway

If players wish, they may use this scenario
to represent the battle between Ashwood
Stranger and the Wind that Walks during the
attack on Halfway. 

In order to do this, make the
following changes:

- The defending gang should be represented by Ashwood Stranger leading an Underhive Outcasts gang.
- The attacking gang is represented by the Wind that Walks (use the profile for an Ash Waste Nomads Chieftain) leading an Ash Waste Nomads gang.
- Rather than generating Warrior Spirits as normal, the Ash Waste Nomads gang can use each Warrior Spirit once during the battle.
