## Attacker And Defender

In this scenario, one gang is the attacker and the other
is the defender. If this scenario is being played as part
of a campaign then the gang that issued the challenge
is the attacker; otherwise, roll off with the winner
deciding whether they will attack or defend.

## Battle Type

This scenario is an Underhive battle; vehicles
and wargear that grant the Mounted condition
cannot be included in either gang’s starting crew
or Reinforcements.

## Battlefield

This scenario uses the standard rules for setting up
a battlefield, as described in the [Battlefield Set-up & Scenarios section](/docs/battlefield-setup/battlefield-set-up).

## Crews

This scenario uses the standard rules for choosing a crew, as described in the [Scenario Rules: Choose Crew section](/docs/battlefield-setup/scenario-rules). The attacker uses the Custom Selection (10) method to determine their crew. The defender’s starting crew are their sentries. They use the Random Selection (5) method, but before drawing their crew, they can declare any number of fighters unfit (or too important) for sentry duty, removing them from their deck – they are returned to the deck after the starting crew has been drawn. The
rest of the deck is then set to one side to form their Reinforcements deck.

## Deployment

The defender sets up their sentries and Captive(s)
anywhere on the battlefield. The attacker then sets
up each of their fighters within 2" of any edge of any
battlefield edge.

## Gang Tactics

The attacker can choose up to three gang tactics from
those available to their gang. The defender randomly
determines two gang tactics from those available to
their gang – however, they cannot be played until the
alarm has been raised.

If, during the pre-battle sequence, one player’s
Gang Rating is less than their opponent’s, they may
randomly determine an additional gang tactic for each
full 100 credits of difference.

## Ending The Battle

If either gang has no fighters left on the battlefield at
the end of any round, the battle ends immediately.

## Victory

The attacker wins if, at the end of the battle, all of their
fighters held Captive were freed and have taken flight.
If no Captives took flight, the defender wins. Otherwise,
the battle is a draw.

## Rewards

#### Experience

If a Captive was freed, the fighter who freed them
earns D3 XP.

If a Captive is freed and takes flight, they earn 1 XP.
If all of the Captives were freed and took flight, the
attacking gang's Leader earns D3 XP (regardless of
whether they took part in the battle or not).

#### Reputation

For each Captive that was freed, the attacker gains 2
Reputation and the defender loses 1 Reputation.

If either gang bottled out, they lose 1 Reputation.

## The Captive

In a campaign, this scenario can only be played if one
or more of the attacker’s fighters has been Captured
by the defender. These models are the Captives. In a
skirmish battle, the attacker picks one of their fighters
to act as the Captive.

## Home Turf Advantage

The defender has the Home Turf Advantage as
described in [Scenario Rules: Gang Tactics](/docs/battlefield-setup/scenario-rules#gang-tactics).

## Captive Models

Captive fighters never gain Ready markers, and cannot
be activated or attacked by either player.
Non-Captive attacking fighters can make the
following action:

**Free Captive (Basic):** Pick a Captive within 1" and roll
a D6. If the result is a 3 or higher, the Captive is freed.
On a 1 or 2 however, the Captive is not freed from their
shackles and remains Captive.

In addition, in the End phase of each round, the
attacking player may declare that one or more Captives
will attempt to escape their bonds. For each Captive
that does so, roll 2D6 and add their Strength. On a
13 or more, they break loose and are freed; on a 6
or less, however, they injure themselves and suffer a
Flesh Wound.

Freed Captives gain a Ready marker in the following
Priority phase and can be activated as normal from
then on. Their rescuers immediately return their
equipment to them.

## Taking Flight

Once the attackers have freed their Captive(s), they
can disappear back into the shadows. Any attacking
model or freed Captive that is within 1" of any edge of
the battlefield at the start of any End phase can take
flight if their controlling player wishes, even if they are
Prone and Seriously Injured. They are removed from
the battlefield, and count as being Out of Action from
now on for the purposes of Bottle checks.

## Reinforcements

In the round that the alarm is raised, and in each
subsequent round, D6 Reinforcements arrive for
the defender.

## Fleeing The Battlefield

If the defender voluntarily Bottles out and flees the
battlefield, their opponent automatically wins the
scenario and the Captives are freed.

### Infiltrate

**Problem:** Infiltrate can be imbalanced or break this scenario.
**Solution:** If at least one player wants, Infiltrate can't be used in this scenario. Instead, Infiltrating fighters can make 1 or 2 move actions before the first round.
