# 109. Tech Raid

_“We’re near the ancestral shard lads, I can feel it in my bones!”_  
\- Dalin Larsekson, The Mad Mechanic of Red Ruin, Charter Master and master engineer

In this scenario, a gang breaks into the heart of a dome in order to loot as much archeotech as they can.

**Source: Apocrypha: The Lost Charter**

## Attacker & Defender

The gang who chose this scenario is the attacker, the other is the defender. Otherwise, randomize one gang to choose who to be attacker and defender.

## Battlefield

Standard. No normal Loot caskets are placed.

## Crews

- **Attacker:** Custom (7).
- **Defender:** Random (D3+2) + Reinforcements.

No vehicles or mounts.

## Tactics Cards

- Custom (2).
- **Underdog** (Gang Rating): +1 random per 100 credits.

## Deployment

1. **Defender:**
   1. 6 Loot (anywhere outside 6" of any edge and other Loot).
   2. Entire starting crew (within 3" of a Loot).
2. **Attacker:** Within 6" of a single battlefield edge.

## Reinforcements

- Defender: D3.
- Start of each End phase (starting on the 2nd round).

## Home Turf Advantage

- Defender:
  - Bottle tests: Roll 2D6 and discard the highest.
  - Rally tests: +1.
  - Hangers-on: Included in the crew on a 4+ (roll individually).

## Hunt For Archeotech

_The attacker is trying to recover lost pieces of archeotech that are rumoured to be held by the defender._

Only attackers can open Loot:

- Opened as a normal Loot casket.
- Do not roll the normal content roll.
- Roll a 3+ to gain 1 point (find a piece of archeotech).
- Apply a -1 modifier if it was opened with the Smash Open (Basic) action.

## Fleeing The Battlefield

If one gang voluntarily bottles out and flees the battlefield, the opponent automatically wins the scenario. If the attacker wins in this way, all remaining Loot are considered opened:

- No XP is awarded
- Roll for each to determine if they contain the archeotech (as normal).

:::danger House Rule (Necrodamus)

This scenario is potentially broken! Apply this fix:

If a gang voluntarily bottles out OR voluntarily flees, the other gang should automatically win.

:::

## Ending the Battle

The battle ends if only 1 gang remains (end of a round).

## Victory

The attacker wins if gaining 3 points.
Otherwise the defender wins.

## Rewards

### Credits

- Winner: 2D6x10.
- Loser: D6x10.

#### Experience

Scenario specific rewards:

- +1 for taking part.
- +1 to an attacker for gaining a point.

Standard rewards:

- +1 for taking an enemy Out of Action.
- +1 for taking an enemy Leader or Champion Out of Action.
- +1 for killing an enemy (during the battle).
- +1 for Rallying.

#### Reputation

- -1 (bottle out).

:::info Narrative Variant

## The Lost Charter

If players wish, they may use this scenario to
represent Dalin Larsekson wresting the ancestral
shard from Heretics Hole.

In order to do this,
make the following changes:

- The defender’s gang should be an Outcast gang led by an [Outcast Leader](/docs/gangs/gang-lists/outcasts#leader) with the Wyrd archetype to represent Ursan Graves and including an [Awakened Ogryn](/docs/gangs/gang-additions/hangers-on-and-brutes/brutes#0-1-awakened-ogryn) to represent the Thinker.
- The attacker’s gang should be an Ironhead Squat Prospectors gang and include an [Exo-Driller](/docs/gangs/gang-lists/squats/#0-2-vartijan-exo-driller-brute).
- The Resistant to the Wyrd special rule is in effect.

#### Resistant To The Wyrd

If one or more Ironhead Squat Prospectors are targeted by a Wyrd Power then one of them may attempt to Disrupt the power as if they were a psyker.
