## Special Rule: Extraction

The defender’s goal is to get the agent to the extraction point. The agent needs to reach the battlefield edge closest to the attacker and roll 5+ in the End phase to escape. If the roll failed, add a cumulative +1 in each subsequent End phase.

## Reinforcements

- Attacker: 1.
- Each End phase (starting on the 2nd round).

:::danger Alternative Variant
The defender may be a single Cyborg Assassin with Bodyguard (any hit against the agent can be transferred to the Cyborg on a 3+, provided that the two are within 2” of each other).
::

:::danger Alternative Variant (Hangers-on)
Any Hangers-on could be used instead of the Agent.
