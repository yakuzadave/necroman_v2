# 42. Propaganda

_Gangs seek to sway the other gangers to their cause._

**Source: Book of Ruin**

## Battlefield

Standard.

## Crews

- Custom (4).

## Tactics Cards

- Custom (2).
- Underdog (starting crew cost): +1 random per 100 credits.

## Deployment

1. Standard.
2. Take turns (starting with the gang with Priority) deploying 12 Houseless Gangers:
   - More than 12” from a battlefield edge.
   - Not within 3” of another fighter.

## Hearts and Minds

_As the hive descends into madness, both sides seek to turn gangers and gangs to their cause._

The players should select 12 fighter models to represent
Houseless Gangers (see page 65). After both crews
have deployed, players take turns, starting with
the player who has priority, placing these models
anywhere on the battlefield more than 12" from an
edge or within 3" of another fighter.

Both gangs are trying to turn the Houseless Gangers
to their cause and then use them against their foes. In this scenario each player’s fighters can use the
Coerce (Basic) action:

:::info COERCE (BASIC)

Choose a Houseless Ganger within 3" and make
a Leadership check for the coercing fighter. If
the check is successful, place a token next to the
Houseless Ganger to indicate that it is now part of
the coercing fighter’s gang.

Houseless Gangers coerced into joining a fighter’s
gang become part of that fighter’s gang for all
intents and purposes and will gain a Ready marker
at the beginning of the following round.

:::

## Don’t Believe Their Lyes

Once a Houseless Ganger has chosen their side, it’s
unlikely they will change sides again… though not
impossible.A fighter may make a Coerce Action against
an enemy Houseless Ganger. If the fighter’s Leadership
check is successful then the other player should make
a Willpower check for their Houseless Ganger, adding 1
to the dice result for each friendly fighter within 3" of the
Houseless Ganger. If the Houseless Ganger passes their
Willpower check,they may immediately take a free Shoot
(Basic) action at the fighter who tried to coerce them. If the Willpower check was failed then the Houseless
Ganger becomes part of the coercing fighter’s gang as
normal and loses any Readied marker if they have one.

Houseless Gangers can be turned from one side to
the other multiple times during a battle.

:::note Designer's Note

Houseless Gangers are loners and orphans from other gangs and can be
represented by any appropriate model – players may choose to use the portions
of their gangs who have been left out of the scenario. For simplicity, Houseless
Gangers should use the following profile:

<FighterCard>

### Houseless Ganger

|  M  | WS  | BS  |  S  |  T  |  W  |  I  |  A  | Ld  | Cl  | Wil | Int |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | --- |
| 5”  | 4+  | 4+  |  3  |  3  |  1  | 4+  |  1  | 8+  | 7+  | 7+  | 8+  |

#### Special Rules

Houseless Gangers are armed and equipped as depicted on their models, and
both players should take a moment at the beginning of the game to agree on
what weapons and wargear each Houseless Ganger is carrying. Remember that
both gangs have a chance of taking control of the Houseless Gangers and so the
inclusion of heavily armed models is entirely reasonable provided both players
accept these more deadly fighters might be used against them.
