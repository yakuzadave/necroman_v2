# 39. Hit & Run

_A gang strikes from the shadows hoping to take down a powerful foe._

**Source: Book of Ruin**

## Attacker & Defender

The gang who chose this scenario is the attacker, the other is the defender. Otherwise, randomize one gang to choose who to be attacker and defender.

## Battlefield

Standard.

## Crews

- **Defender:** Random (D3+7).
- **Attacker:** Custom (D3+7).

## Tactics Cards

- Custom (2).
- Underdog (starting crew cost): +1 random per 100 credits.

## Deployment

1. **Defender:** Within 6” of the centre of the battlefield.
2. **Attacker:** Anywhere at least 8” from any defenders.

## Make Them Pay

Gain points for taking enemies Out of Action (cumulative):

- 1 per fighter
- +2 if the fighter was the Leader

## I Have A Sense Of Foreboding…

After deployment, test if the defenders spot attackers. Each defender can make an Intelligence test with the following modifiers:

- **Partial cover:** -1
- **Full cover:** -2
- **More than 12” away:** -2

If passed, make a single Shoot or Move action. The defender decides the order of the attacks. Only a single test is made regardless of how many enemies can be seen.

## Butcher & Bolt

_The attackers are trying to inflict as much damas as possible without being drawn into a protracted firefight._

Attackers can spend a Double action (Vanish) if all the following conditions are true:

- Out of LOS of any enemy fighters.
- At least 6” away from any Active enemy fighters.

Pass an Intelligence test to remove the fighter from the battlefield. Vanished fighters do not count as Out of Action, but do also not count as part of the crew when making Bottle tests.

## Ending the Battle

The battle ends when only one gang has fighters remaining.

## Victory

The gang that scored most points is the winner. If the score is equal:

- **Uprising:** The gang with Ascendancy is the winner.
- **Otherwise:** Draw.
