# 72. Last Rites for the Machine

_An Archeotek faces their final fight._

**Source: House of Artifice**

:::info Designer's Note: Death For All!

While the scenarios presented here have been designed specifically for House Van Saar gangs, there is no reason that, with the permission of the Arbitrator, they might not be used for any gang. Scenarios such as

Deus Ex Machina lend themselves well to multi-player scenarios, where multiple gangs attempt to bring down an Archaeo-Cyborg. By contrast, Last Rites for the Machine makes for an interesting Arbitrated game, with the Arbitrator taking control of the Fading Legend while one gang attempts to protect them from destruction – or, alternatively, the Arbitrator can bring an entire cabal of Archeoteks, pitting them against the players and their gangs.

## Battlefield

This scenario uses the Battlefield Set-up guidelines, as
described in the Necromunda Rulebook.

## Attacker And Defender

In this scenario, one gang is the attacker and the other
is the defender. If one gang is of House Van Saar and
their opponent is not, then the House Van Saar gang
will be the defender. Otherwise, the player whose gang
has the lower rating is the defender. If both gangs have
the same rating, players roll off and the winner decides
whether they will attack or defend.

## Crews

This scenario uses the standard rules for choosing a
crew, as described in the Battlefield Set-up & Scenarios
section of the Necromunda Rulebook. Both players
use the Custom Selection (D3+7) method to choose
their crew.

In addition, the defender’s starting crew includes the
Fading Legend, as described opposite.

## Deployment

This scenario uses the standard rules for deployment,
as described in the Necromunda Rulebook.

## Gang Tactics

Each player may choose two gang tactics from those
available to their gang. If, during the pre-battle
sequence, the total credits value of fighters in one
player’s starting crew is less than their opponent’s,
they may randomly determine one additional gang
tactic for each full 100 credits of difference.

## Ending the Battle

The battle ends when only one gang has fighters
remaining on the battlefield.

## Victory

The defender wins if, at the end of the battle, the
Fading Legend has not gone Out of Action. The attacker
wins if, at the end of the battle, the Fading Legend has
gone Out of Action as a result of the “None of us are
getting any Younger!” special rule. Any other result is
a draw.

## Rewards

### Credits

The victorious gang adds D6x10 credits to their Stash.

### Experience

- Each fighter who took part in the battle earns 1 XP.
- Every fighter belonging to the victorious gang earns 1 additional XP.

### Reputation

- If the defender is victorious, they gain D3 Reputation.
- If the attacker is victorious, they gain D3 Reputation.
- If either gang bottled out, they lose 1 Reputation.

## GOING OUT IN STYLE

The defender’s starting crew must include the Fading Legend. This is a legendary
House fighter who is rapidly approaching the end of their career as their aging body
and many cyberteknika enhancements fail them. The Fading Legend has but one
goal: to secure their legacy in a blaze of glory, facing their foes one last time before
checking out:

- If the defending gang is of House Van Saar, the Fading Legend is a House
  Agent equipped with up to 400 credits worth of weapons, Wargear and
  Archaeo-cyberteknika.
- If the defending gang is of any other House, the Fading Legend may be either a
  House Agent or Bounty Hunter equipped with up to 300 credits worth of weapons
  and Wargear.

In both cases, the Fading Legend may be equipped with weapons and Wargear
purchased from the equipment list used by the defender’s Leader, from the Trading
Post or from the Black Market.

### “None Of Us Are Getting Any Younger!”

Over the course of the battle, the Fading Legend will weaken and, if the battle proves
too protracted, may even succumb to their failing health mid-fight. Keep track of how
many rounds have been played and apply the following negative effects:

- In the End phase of rounds one, two and three, there are no negative effects
  to apply.
- In the End phase of round four, and in the End phase of each subsequent round,
  reduce by 1 the following characteristics on the Fading Legend’s profile:
  - MA (to a minimum of 1")
  - BS (to a minimum of 6+)
  - WS (to a minimum of 6+)
  - Wounds (to a minimum of 0)

Should the Fading Legend’s Wounds characteristic be reduced to 0 in this way, they
have succumbed to their failing health. The Fading Legend immediately goes Out
of Action.

## Inspirational Figure

The Fading Legend provides huge inspiration to their fellow gangers, and to be able
to fight with them one last time is an honour indeed. To represent this, the defending
gang may choose to automatically pass any Bottle tests it is required to make whilst
the Fading Legend is still on the battlefield.

## Hated Foe

The Fading Legend is a hated foe to their enemies, and the opportunity to end their
career in the underhive is not one to be missed. To represent this, any member of
the attacking gang that can target the Fading Legend with a ranged attack can do
so even if they are not the closest target, without having to first pass a Cool check to
do so.
