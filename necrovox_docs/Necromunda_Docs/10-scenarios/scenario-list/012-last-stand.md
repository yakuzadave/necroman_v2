# 12. Last Stand

_The Guilders are gunning for a gang and will take them down at any cost!_

_Source: Necromunda 2018 Rulebook_  

## Attacker & Defender

The gang who chose this scenario is the attacker, the other is the defender. Otherwise, randomize one gang to choose who to be attacker and defender.

## Battlefield

Standard.

## Crews

- **Attacker:** Custom (D3+6) + Reinforcements.
- **Defender:** Random (D3+5).

## Home Turf Advantage

Defender:

- **Bottle tests:** Roll 2D6 and discard the highest.
- **Rally tests:** +1.
- **Hangers-on:** Included in the crew on a 4+ (roll individually).

## Tactics Cards

- Attacker: Custom (2).
- Defender: Random (2).
- Underdog (starting crew cost): +1 random per 100 credits.

## Deployment

The defender deploys their entire crew within 6” of the centre of the board. Then the attacker deploys their entire crew within 2” of all board edges.

## Objectives

The defender must hold out as long as they can, while the attacker must wipe them out.

## Reinforcements: Outnumbered

- Attacker: D6.
- Each End phase.
- Attackers taken Out of Action can rejoin instead of suffering Lasting Injury rolls (removing any Conditions).

:::note Alternative Variant

This can be a multi-player scenario, with 2 or more gangs attacking the defender. If the total Rating of the combined attacking gangs is at least double that of the defender’s, do not use the outnumbered special rule.

:::

## Ending the Battle

The battle ends when only one gang has fighters remaining (at the end of a round).

## Victory

If the defender still has fighters (not Seriously Injured or Broken) on the Battlefield by the start of round 7, then they are the winner, otherwise the attacker is victorious.

## Rewards

The rewards depend on how long the defenders were able to hold out.
