# 20. Fighter Down

_A gang searches for a lost companion before the underhive gets them for good._

_Source: Necromunda 2018 Rulebook_  

## Attacker & Defender

The gang who chose this scenario is the attacker, the other is the defender. Otherwise, randomize one gang to choose who to be attacker and defender.

## Battlefield

Standard.

## Crews

- Random (D3+2) + Reinforcements.

The attacking crew must include a random Ganger or Juve to be the wounded fighter.

## Tactics Cards

- **Attacker:** Custom (2).
- **Defender:** Random (2).
- **Underdog** (starting crew cost): +1 random per 100 credits.

## Deployment

Standard. The attacker places the wounded fighter face down within 8” of the centre of the board.

## Reinforcements

- D3 per gang.
- Each End phase (starting on the 2nd round).
- Within 1" of any battlefield edge and at least 12" from enemies (deployed by the controlling gang).

## Special Rule: The Wounded Fighter

For the purpose of this scenario, the wounded fighter is considered to have suffered a Serious Injury, one which they can't recover from - do not roll to see if they recover in the End phase. Instead, they remain Seriously Injured until they either go Out of Action or are carried off the board. They may still make Crawl (Double) actions as normal.

The wounded fighter may be taken Out of Action with the Coup de Grace action as normal. Friendly fighters may spend a Double action (Carry) if activating within 1” of the wounded fighter, allowing them to move up to their Move characteristic and take the wounded fighter with them. If the wounded fighter begins their activation within 1” of the board edge closest to the attacker’s deployment area, they may escape off the board.

## Special Rule: Carrion Creatures

In the underhive, there are countless predators skulking in the shadows - mutated rats, murder-pedes, rust vultures and others.

After the wounded fighter and both gangs have deployed, roll D6+3 to find out how many Carrion Creatures are present. Take turns, starting with the player with Priority, to place these creatures on the board, at least 12” from any fighters (including the wounded fighter).

In each End phase, take turns moving the Carrion Creatures, starting with the player with Priority. Any Carrion Creature that ends its movement in base contact with a fighter will make a Melee (Basic) action against it - after this action has been resolved move the creature D3” directly away from the fighter. The fighter may not make Reaction attacks.

## Ending the Battle

The battle ends when at least 1 condition is true:

:::note Alternative Variant

Custom underhive predators may be included. Creatures may be placed anywhere on the board, or keep their location secret using Pitch Black special rule from In the Dark scenario. The creatures are only revealed when fighters get within line of sight of them. If a creature moves out of line of sight, replace it with a counter. In the End phase, each counter may swap which monster it represents.

:::note Alternative Variant (Hangers-on)
