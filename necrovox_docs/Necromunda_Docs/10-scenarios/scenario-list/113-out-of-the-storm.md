# 113. Out of the Storm

_\*kzzzz\* the Emperor they’re using the storm to attack, we’ve gotta warn \*kzzzz\*_  
\- Last vox-communication from Scouting Team Epsilon 7

In this scenario, a gang attacks under the cover of an approaching dust storm.

**Source: Cinderak Burning**

## Attacker & Defender

The gang who chose this scenario is the attacker, the other is the defender. Otherwise, randomize one gang to choose who to be attacker and defender.

## Battlefield

Standard (Ash Wastes) with the following exception: Defender chooses a battlefield edge as its own and deploys walls and defences across the centre of the battlefield. The opposite edge is the strom front.

The area between the defender's edge and the defences are intended to represent the outskirts of a settlement and the rest of the battlefield should be the ash wastes.

## Crews

- Custom (7)

Vehicles and mounts can be included.

## Tactics Cards

- Custom (2).
- **Underdog** (starting crew cost): +1 random per 100 credits.

## Deployment

1. **Defender:** Anywhere in the defender's half of the battlefield (closer to the defender's edge).
2. **Attacker:** Anywhere in the opposite half of the battlefield, at least 6" from the defender's half.

## Home Turf Advantage

Defender:

- **Bottle tests:** Roll 2D6 and discard the highest.
- **Rally tests:** +1.
- **Hangers-on:** Included in the crew on a 4+ (roll individually).

## The Coming Storm

_A gang attacks under the cover of an approaching dust storm._

The storm front is the edge opposite to the defender's edge. This edge moves 6" towards the defender's edge at the start of each round.

Any models the storm front moves over, or that move
past the storm front during their activation disappear
into the storm:

- Remove them from the battlefield, but keep any Ready status (otherwise become Ready at the start of any round as normal).
- When activating, make an Intelligence check:
  - Pass: Deployed B2B with the storm front, then activate as normal.
  - Fail: Remove their ready marker and check again the next time they activate.

## Battle Of Attrition

Gain points in the following ways:

- Enemy taken OoA: 1 VP.
- Enemy Leader/Champion taken OoA: 1 VP.
- Enemy vehicle Wrecked: 2 VP.

## Fleeing The Battlefield

If one gang voluntarily bottles out and subsequently flees the battlefield, the opponent automatically wins the scenario.

## Ending the Battle

The battle ends when the storm front reaches the defender’s battlefield edge.

## Victory

The winner is whichever gang has the most Victory
points; if both gangs are tied on Victory points then the result is a draw.

## Rewards

#### Credits

- Winner: 2D6x10.
- Loser: D6x5.
- Draw: D6x10.

#### Experience

Scenario specific rewards:

- +1 for taking part.
- +1 for taking an enemy Leader or Champion Out of Action.

Standard rewards:

- +1 for taking an enemy Out of Action.
- +1 for taking an enemy Leader or Champion Out of Action.
- +1 for killing an enemy (during the battle).
- +1 for Rallying.

#### Reputation

- +D3 (win).
- -1 (bottle out).

:::info Narrative Variant

## Assault On Cinderak City

If players wish, they may use this scenario to represent the Ash Waste Nomads’ assault of
Cinderak City.

In order to do this, make the following changes:

- The defender should play with a mix of gangs as all are called to defend Cinderak City. Escher
  gangers on Cutters and Goliath Maulers are especially thematic.
- The Devils in the Dust rule is in effect (see below).
- The attacker should take an Ash Wastes Nomads gang of equivalent gang rating.

#### Devils In The Dust

Attacking Ash Waste Nomads fighters automatically pass the Intelligence check to see if they find their
way out of the storm.
