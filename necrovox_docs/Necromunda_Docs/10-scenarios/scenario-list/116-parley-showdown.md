## War Of Crones

If players wish they may use this scenario to represent Cyniss’ attack on Adina.

In order to do this make the following changes:

- One gang’s starting crew should be made up of [Lady Credo](/docs/gangs/gang-additions/alliances/criminals#lady-credo), [Athera and Stix](/docs/gangs/gang-additions/hired-guns/agents/#athera--stix-escher--lady-credos-rebellion) and five [Escher Gang Queens](/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-escher/#queen-leader) to represent Adina and her court.
- The opposing gang should be made up of [Cyniss](/docs/gangs/gang-additions/hired-guns/agents/#cyniss-escher), two [Death-maidens](/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-escher/#death-maiden-specialist-champion) and three [Matriarchs](/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-escher/#matriarch-champion).
- Reinforcements are not used in this version.
