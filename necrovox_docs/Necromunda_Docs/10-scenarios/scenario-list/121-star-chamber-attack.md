:::info Narrative Variant

## Sump City Sinking

If players wish, they may use this scenario to
represent the battle between the Delaque and the Cult of the Ravenous One.

In order to do this,
make the following changes:

- The defender's gang should be a Delaque gang and should include at least one Spyker.
- The attacker's gang should be a Corpse Grinder Cult gang.
- The Confluence of Shadows (see [Spyker profile](/docs/gangs/gang-additions/hangers-on-and-brutes/hangers-on/#0-2-spyker)) and Blessed by the Lord of Skin and Sinew (see [CGC fighter profiles](/docs/gangs/gang-lists/corpse-grinder-cult/#fighters)) rules are both in effect.

#### Resistant To The Wyrd

If one or more Ironhead Squat Prospectors are
targeted by a Wyrd Power then one of them may
attempt to Disrupt the power as if they were
a psyker.
