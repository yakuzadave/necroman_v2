## Battle Type

This scenario is an Underhive battle; vehicles and
wargear that grant the Mounted condition cannot be
included in any gang’s starting crew.

## Battlefield

This scenario uses the standard rules for setting up
a battlefield, as described in the [Battlefield Set-up & Scenarios section](/docs/battlefield-setup/battlefield-set-up). It is advisable to make
the battlefield no larger than 24" x 24".

## Crews

This scenario uses the standard rules for choosing a
crew, as described in the [Scenario Rules: Choose Crew section](/docs/battlefield-setup/scenario-rules). All gangs use the Custom
Selection (1) method to determine their crew – this
fighter is their Champion.

## Deployment

Players take turns placing their starting crew in contact
with one of the battlefield edges and at least 12" from
any other Champion.

## Gang Tactics

Each player may choose one gang tactic from those
available to their gang.

## Ending The Battle

If there is no more than one Champion on the
battlefield at the end of any round, the battle
ends immediately.

## Victory

The gang with the last Champion standing is the winner.
If there are no Champions left at the end of the game,
it is a draw between all the participants.

## Rewards

#### Credits

The victorious gang adds D6x5 credits to their Stash
for each other Champion that took part in the fight.

#### Experience

Each Champion earns 1 XP for each enemy Champion
they take Out of Action.

The victorious Champion earns an additional D3 XP.

#### Reputation

Each gang gains 1 Reputation for showing up, plus
2 extra Reputation if their Champion survives to
round six.

The victorious gang gains an additional 4 Reputation.

## It’s Only A Scratch!

No one likes a quick fight, and the Champions know
that they need to put on a show with lots of blood.
For this scenario, fighters ignore Flesh Wound results
on the Injury dice and treat Seriously Injured results
as Flesh Wounds instead. Fighters cannot perform the
Coup de Grace (Simple) action – no easy deaths!

## Round One…

Pit fights have rules… after a fashion. For the first two
rounds, no Ranged weapons or Grenades may be used.
In rounds three and four, no Ranged weapons with the
Unwieldy trait or Grenades may be used. From round
five onwards, all weapons may be used.

## Arbitrating The Scenario

The Arbitrator can act as arena overseer,
setting up the battlefield and controlling its perils.
In addition to the placement of doors, gantries and
barricades, during the End phase, the Arbitrator
can add pitfalls, frag or melta traps, ducts or other
features to the battlefield.
