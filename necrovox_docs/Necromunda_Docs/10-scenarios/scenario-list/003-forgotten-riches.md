# 3. Forgotten Riches

_Sometimes, just the rumour of a newly discovered tunnel sprawl packed with discarded riches attracts looters._

_Source: Necromunda 2018 Rulebook_  

## Battlefield

Standard: 7 tiles. Take turns placing tiles (starting with the winner of a roll-off). The first tile marks the centre of the battlefield. The remaining 6 tiles must be adjacent to the first.

## Crews

- Custom.

The maximum number of fighters in each crew is determined by rolling 2D6:

|  2D6  | Result |
| :---: | :----- |
|  2-3  | 5      |
|  4-5  | 6      |
|  6-8  | 7      |
| 9-10  | 8      |
| 11-12 | 9      |

## Tactics Cards

- Custom (3).
- Underdog (starting crew cost): +1 random per 100 credits.

## Deployment

Take turns placing 5 loot caskets (starting with the winner of a roll-off):

- Must be placed in a separate tiles.
- The first must be placed in the central tile.
- At last 6” from each other.
- Not in inaccessible areas.

Then, the winner of another roll-off selects a tile without a loot casket as deployment zone (roll-off again). Deploy within 3” of the edge of the tile (on the edge of the battlefield). The opponent then does the same on the other remaining tile. If the 2 deployment tiles are adjacent, fighters can't be set up within 6” of an enemy.

## Objectives

Both teams are attempting to get away with as much loot as they can carry and prevent their enemies doing the same. Each gang scores points when enemies go Out of Action or loot caskets are secured:

- 1 point for each enemy that goes Out of Action.
- 2 points for each loot casket (not including ammo caches) on their starting tile within 3” of the board edge when the battle ends.
- D3 points for being the last remaining gang.

:::note
Presumably fleeing fighters count as OoA (universal rule) since anything else is not spelled out.

Rewards:

- Points determine which leader (if any) receives XP bonus.
- Loot caskets (winning condition) determine Reputation and Credits bonus.
- Last gang on the battlefield only affects D3 bonus points and captives.

## Horrors in the Dark

When a fighter activates outside 8" of any other fighters (friend or foe), roll a D6:

| &nbsp;&nbsp;D6&nbsp;&nbsp; | Result                                                                                                                                        |
| :------------------------: | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|             1              | Suffer a Strength 6 hit with AP -1 and Damage 2. If Seriously Injured, the fighter is dragged away into the darkness and taken Out of Action. |
|            2-3             | The fighter can't make any actions this turn.                                                                                                 |
|            4-5             | The fighter can only make one action this turn.                                                                                               |
|             6              | The fighter activates normally.                                                                                                               |

:::danger House Rule (Necrodamus)

Fighters that are Seriously Injured or Broken should not count for Horrors in the Dark.

## Fleeing the Battlefield

If one gang voluntarily bottles out and flees the battlefield, their opponent automatically wins the scenario. The winning gang claims any loot caskets left on the battlefield at the end of the battle.

## Ending the Battle

The battle ends when only one gang has fighters remaining (at the end of a round).

## Victory

The gang that secured most loot caskets at the end of the battle wins. Otherwise it is a draw.

## Rewards

#### Credits

- +D6x10 for each secured loot casket.

#### Experience

Scenario specific rewards:

- +1 for taking part.
- +1 to the Leader of the gang that scored the most points, regardless of whether they took part in the battle or not (in case of a draw, neither Leader gets this bonus).

Standard rewards:

- +1 for taking an enemy Out of Action.
- +1 for taking an enemy Leader or Champion Out of Action.
- +1 for killing an enemy (during the battle).
- +1 for Rallying.

#### Reputation

- +2 to the winner (secured most loot caskets).
- +1 to both gangs if this was the first battle against each other.
- -1 to any gang that bottled out.
