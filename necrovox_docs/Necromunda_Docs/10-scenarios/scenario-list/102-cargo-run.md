## Attacker And Defender

In this scenario, one gang is the attacker and the other
is the defender. If this scenario is being played as part
of a campaign then the gang that issued the challenge
is the attacker; otherwise, roll off with the winner
deciding whether they will attack or defend. If only one
player has vehicles in their gang, they are automatically
the defender.

## Battle Type

This scenario is a Rolling Roads Ash Wastes battle;
vehicles and wargear that grant the Mounted condition
can be included in either gangâ€™s starting crew.

## Battlefield

This scenario uses the standard rules for setting up
a battlefield, as described in the [Battlefield Set-up & Scenarios section](/docs/battlefield-setup/battlefield-set-up). This scenario is
designed to be played on a 6'x4' battlefield.

## Crews

This scenario uses the standard rules for choosing a
crew, as described in the [Scenario Rules: Choose Crew section](/docs/battlefield-setup/scenario-rules). Both gangs use the Hybrid
Selection (3+5) method to determine their crew.

## Deployment

Players take turns, starting with the gang with the
highest gang rating, placing models within 12" of the
Trailing Edge. No model can be placed within 1" of an
enemy model.

## Gang Tactics

This scenario uses the standard rules for gang tactics
as described in [Scenario Rules: Gang Tactics](/docs/battlefield-setup/scenario-rules#gang-tactics).

## Ending The Battle

The battle ends when the defender reaches
their destination or if at the end of any round the
vehicle carrying the cargo is destroyed or has fled
the battlefield.

## Victory

If the attacker destroyed the vehicle carrying the
cargo, or it fled the battlefield, then they are victorious,
otherwise the defender is victorious.

## Rewards

#### Credits

The winning gang adds 4D6x10 credits to their Stash
as they either get paid for delivering the cargo or sell
their stolen goods.

#### Experience

If the vehicle carrying the cargo survived then it earns an additional 1 XP.

#### Reputation

The winning gang gains D3 Reputation.

If either gang bottled out, they lose 1 Reputation.

## Rolling Roads

This is a Rolling Roads scenario and follows all the rules for Rolling Roads
(see page 202).

## The Cargo

The defender must designate one of their vehicles to be carrying the cargo. If they
have more than one vehicle then it must be the most expensive vehicle they have in
their gang. The cargo has no effect on the vehicle aside from acting as an objective
for the scenario.

## Dangerous Roads

At the start of the second round, and each round thereafter, the defender rolls a D6
and adds the round number to see if they will reach their destination this round. On
a 10 or higher, this round is the last round of the battle. Before the defender rolls the
dice to see if they have reached their destination they must choose which route they
are taking, and add the bonus to the dice roll as detailed below. The more dangerous
the route, the higher the bonus.

| Bonus | Route Effects                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

|  +2   | The battlefield has cliff sides and if any model moves less than 8" during its activation, it falls through the ash crust and goes Out of Action. Immediately make a Lasting Injury roll or Lasting Damage roll for any model removed in this way.                                        |
|  +3   | The battlefield has impassable sides and is on fire! At the start of their activation, all models must test to see if they catch fire just as if they had been hit by a weapon with a Blaze trait. In addition, vehicles must make a Loss of Control test at the end of their activation. |
