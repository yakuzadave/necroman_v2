# 98. Wasteland Encounter

_"Whether it is the badzones of a hive or the deep wastes, you never quite know who, or what's, out there for you."_  
\- Frenk Horlast, Spider Points Watermonger

In this scenario, two gangs chance upon each other in the badzones or the wastes, and a vicious battle erupts.
