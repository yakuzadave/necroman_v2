# 101. Incoming Storm

_"Out in the wastes the weather can change quicker than a Delaque'll stab you in the back… and that's pretty damn quick!"_  
\- Kosman Nails, Iron Rider, House Orlock

| Round | Weather                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| :---: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
|  1-3  | **Ash Clouds:** Visibility (18").                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|  4-5  | **Choking Gloom:** Visibility (12"). Fighters without respirators must spend a Basic action to Move.                                                                                                                                                         |
|   6   | **Ash Cyclone:** Visibility (9"). The Cyclone is a Blast (24") that starts in the centre of the battlefield and in each end phase scatters 3D6" (stopping if contacting a battlefield edge). Fighters that start or end touched by the Blast becomes Pinned. |
