# 70. The Long Night

_Gangs must fight to survive a sector-wide shutdown, battling darkness, cold, critters and each other until the artificial dawn comes._

**Source: White Dwarf, December 2020**

:::note Multi-player Games

End Game Scenarios work best when they are multi-player games. While it might be appropriate for a single powerful gang to see if they can break free of the underhive, take down the local warlord or escape into the wastes, these games will be more memorable and more exciting if all the players have a stake in the outcome rather than watching from the sidelines. Fortunately, Necromunda is a game that lends itself well to multi-player games, and guidelines for running Necromunda with more than two players can be found in the rules, covering such things as determining Priority when there is more than two players and limiting the number of fighters each player can field in especially large games in order to keep the action moving. The End Game Scenarios presented in this article are all designed witrh multi-player gaming in mind.

:::

## Attacker & Defender

The gang with the highest rating is the defender (in case of a tie, the winner of a roll-off decides). The remaining gangs are the attacker.

This scenario can be fought one-on one, but is intended for one powerful gang to fight against a group of less powerful gangs.

Even though one side is the attacker, these gangs are not allies. All gangs fight as individual gangs and treat all other gangs as enemies.

## Battlefield

Standard.

## Crews

- **Defender:** Custom.
- **Attacker** (crew size is per gang):
  - 1-2 attacking gangs: Custom (10).
  - 3 attacking gangs: Custom (7).
  - 4+ attacking gangs: Custom (5).

## Tactics Cards

- Custom (2).

## Deployment

Standard.

## Deepest Darkness, Freezing Cold

_Gangs must fight to survive a sector-wide shutdown, battling darkness, cold, critters and each other until the artificial dawn comes. In an act of desperation, or perhaps local sabotage, power to this entire section has been shut down. Darkness descends as lumens fail, cold sets in as thermal vents close, and critters gather as automated settlement defenses power down. The plummeting temperatures force fighters to constantly move for warmth._

- Apply the Pitch Black rules.

All fighters must have one of the following effects or actions during each activation to avoid suffering a Flesh Wound (from freezing):

- Move (Simple) action.
- Charge (Double) action.
- Ablaze (burning fighters won’t freeze).
- Pass a Toughness test (to prevent freezing).

## Monsters Everywhere

_With the darkness comes the monsters, and in the darkness of the underhive, there are many monsters._

In each activation, roll 2D6, then choose the highest roll as the result and apply the following to that fighter:

| Highest D6 | Result                                                                                                              |
| :--------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|     1      | Suffer a S6 AP-1 D2 hit. If Seriously Injured as a result, go Out of Action (dragged away into the darkness).       |
|    2-3     | Can't make any actions this activation (busy fighting to survive a nightmarish creature emerging from the shadows). |
|    4-5     | Can only make 1 action this turn (hesitates when hearing a noise in the darkness).                                  |
|     6      | Activate normally (the fighter goes unnoticed).                                                                     |

## Ending the Battle

ENDING THE BATTLE
The battle ends when at least one of the following is true:

- End of round 9.
- Only one gang remains.

## Victory

The gang with the most remaining fighters wins.

## Outcome

_Win or lose, this long night will mark the passing of a gang into legend. If the most powerful gang wins, they have survived and will wander off into the dark of the underhive, never to be seen again (though tales will be told about them for some time). Otherwise, well, the bones of the great look much like everyone else’s!_

## Rewards

#### Experience

Scenario specific rewards:

- +1 to each attacking fighter for taking part.

Standard rewards:

- +1 for taking an enemy Out of Action.
- +1 for taking an enemy Leader or Champion Out of Action.
- +1 for killing an enemy (during the battle).
- +1 for Rallying.

#### Reputation

- +1 to each attacking gang.
- +1 to each attacking gang if the defender bottled out.

:::note Alternatives

Actual monsters can be added to the darkness. These can be anything from swarms of hive rats, plage zombies, crawling xenos horrors or even warped Daemons. Or use scenario complications like Horrors of the Underhive.

These monsters can even appear and disappear from one round to the next, never knowing exactly where or when they will show up.

These fighters should move and attack in the End phase and controlled by someone not participating with a gang.
