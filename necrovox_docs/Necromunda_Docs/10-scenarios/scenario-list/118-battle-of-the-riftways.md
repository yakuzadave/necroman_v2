:::info Narrative Variant

## Assault On Gate 17

If players wish, they may use this scenario to
represent the Goliath attack on Gate 17.

In order to do this, make the following changes:

- The attacking gang should be a Goliath gang, predominately made up of Goliath Maulers.
- The defending gang should be a mix of Escher and Orlock fighters, with a large number of Escher
  Cutters and Orlock Wreckers.
