:::info Narrative Variant

## Queen of Ash Town

If players wish, they may use this scenario to
represent Athera and the Ash Wyld’s defence of
the House of Gilded Grace.

In order to do this, make the following changes:

- The attacker’s gang should be a Goliath gang.
- The defender’s gang should be an Escher gang with a large number of Wyld Runners led by [Athera](/docs/gangs/gang-additions/hired-guns/agents/#athera--stix) and accompanied by an [Apprentice Clan Chymist](/docs/gangs/gang-additions/hangers-on-and-brutes/hangers-on/#0-1-apprentice-clan-chymist).
- The House of Gilded Grace rule is in effect and each defending fighter starts the battle with a dose of either [Blood Boil](/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-escher/chem-alchemy#toxic-ammo) or [Skin Fire](/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-escher/chem-alchemy#toxic-ammo), while Athera starts with a dose of [Predator’s Kiss](/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-escher/chem-alchemy#stims-1).
