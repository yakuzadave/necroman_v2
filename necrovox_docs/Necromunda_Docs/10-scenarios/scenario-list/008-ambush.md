# 8. Ambush / Wasteland Ambush

_A gang sets a trap for their rivals, hoping to catch them unawares…_

_Source: Necromunda 2018 Rulebook_  

## Attacker & Defender

The gang who chose this scenario is the attacker, the other is the defender. Otherwise, randomize one gang to choose who to be attacker and defender.

## Battlefield

Standard. Any type (2D, 3D, Ash Wastes).

Vehicles can't be included (regardless of battlefield type).

Defender can place all scatter terrain. The centre can only have scatter terrain within 12" (no large terrain).

## Crews

- **Attacker:** Custom.
- **Defender:** Random (D3+5).

## Tactics Cards

- Attacker: Custom (2).
- Defender: Random (2).
- Underdog (starting crew cost): +1 random per 100 credits.

## Deployment

1. **Defender:** Set up each fighter one by one (in any order) within 6" of the centre. However, roll a 6+ per fighter when setting up to have that fighter set aside instead.
1. **Attacker:** Anywhere at least 12" from any defender, or 6" if no defender can draw LOS to the fighter.
1. **Defender:** Set up each fighter that were set aside, anywhere at least 1" from any attacker.

## Surprise Attack

_Take out as many enemies as possible! An alternative for the defenders is to escape._

The attacker has Priority in the first round. The attacker can activate D3 fighters before the first defender activates.

In addition, during the first round, each fighter must pass a Cool check when activating, or the fighter can only make one action this turn (instead of the normal 2).

#### Slipping the Net

Defenders within 1” of a battlefield edge at the start of the End phase can escape (even if Seriously Injured). Escaping fighters count as being Out of Action for the purposes of Bottle tests.

## Fleeing the Battlefield

If the defender voluntarily Bottles out and flees the battlefield, the attacker automatically wins the scenario. The attacking Leader is considered to have defiled the gang relic.

## Ending the Battle

The battle ends when only one gang has fighters remaining (at the end of a round).

## Victory

The attacker wins if more defenders were taken Out of Action than those who escaped (fleeing fighters do not count). Otherwise the defender wins.

## Rewards

#### Experience

Scenario specific rewards:

- +1 for taking part.
- +1 to each escaping defended.
- +1 to the attacking Leader if no defenders escaped (regardless of whether they took part in the battle or not).

Standard rewards:

- +1 for taking an enemy Out of Action.
- +1 for taking an enemy Leader or Champion Out of Action.
- +1 for killing an enemy (during the battle).
- +1 for Rallying.

#### Reputation

- +1 to the winning attacker.
- +2 to the winning defender.
- -1 to any gang that bottled out.
