:::

For Armour types and values, see [the armoury](/docs/reference-tables/armoury/armour-and-fields).

#### Armour Types

A fighter can wear up to 1 of each type of armour at the same time:

- Armour (Standard)
- Combined Armour (improves other armour)
- Extra (can be equipped on top of standard armour).
- Shield (improves other armour)
- Field Armour (unmodifiable)

#### Improved Front Armour

Some saves are improved from attacks originating in the front arc (normally 90° vision arc). For Blast weapons, measure from the centre of the blast. A fighter must be Standing (before being hit) in order to receive this bonus. If the fighter is Prone, it has no front arc.

#### Save Modifier

Some saves improve other saves (unless otherwise noted). Use a default 7+ save when applying save modifiers for fighters without any other (modifiable) save.

#### Saves Against Environment

Some saves come from environmental effects and underhive perils. These have only an effect against attacks that doesn’t originate from another fighter.

#### Save Types

There are many different types of saves. Unless otherwise specified:

- If having multiple alternatives, choose a single one for the save roll.
- Saves have no effect against attacks that ignores saves completely.
- Any save counts as normal unless otherwise noted.

Here are other save types:

- **Bonus:** A save that can be used in addition to the normal save (and in addition to other bonus saves).
- **Unmodifiable by AP:** Count the attack as having AP ‘-’.
- **Irreducible by AP:** Can't be reduced by AP.
- **Irreducible:** Can't be reduced by any modifiers.
- **Unmodifiable:** Can't be modified in any way.
- **Invulnerable:** An unmodifiable save that can **always** be made regardless of any special rules that would normally ignore the save. If successful, the hit counts as missed (completely ignored)

:::danger House Rule
The official rules for armour, shields and fields are a complete mess, and the rules here will deviate some from that. This is an attempt to improve balance and make sense of it all.
