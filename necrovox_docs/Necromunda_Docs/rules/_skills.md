## Agility

### 1. Catfall

Halve the vertical distance (rounding up) when falling or jumping. If not Seriously Injured or taken Out of Action, pass an Initiative test to remain standing instead of being Pinned.

:::danger House Rule (Necrodamus, A&A)
When falling into a pitfall, mark the closest edge. At the end of that round, place the fighter next to the pitfall on a 4+.
:::

### 2. Clamber

When climbing vertical distances, the move is not halved

:::danger House Rule (Necrodamus, A&A)
Move freely through ductways without spending a Crawl Through (Double) action.
:::

### 3. Dodge

6+ save (invulnerable, unmodifiable, bonus) against ranged and close combat attacks.

If hit by a Blast/Template, a successful save does not automatically cancel the attack, instead, it allows to move up to 2” before determining if the fighter is hit.

### 4. Mighty Leap

The fighter can ignore the first 2” of the distance when leaping. Leaping over gaps of 2” or less does not require an Initiative test. All other rules for leaping over gaps still apply.

### 5. Spring Up

If Pinned when activated, pass an Initiative test to make a free Stand Up (Basic) action.

### 6. Sprint

When making 2 (or more) Move actions in an activation, double the Move characteristic for the last Move.

## Brawn

### 1. Bull Charge

Melee weapons gain Knockback and +1 Strength when Charging.

### 2. Bulging Biceps

Using Unwieldy weapon only requires 1 hand rather than the usual 2 (only applies to close combat). Unwieldy weapons still takes up two weapon slots as normal.

### 3. Crushing Blow

Nominate 1 attack (not Sidearm) before rolling to hit. If it hits, add +1S and +1D.

### 4. Headbutt

Can spend a Basic action (Headbutt):Target an Engaged enemy and roll 2D6. At least 1 dice must roll equal to or higher than the target's Toughness to inflict a hit:

- S+2 and D2 (use the attacker's Strength).

Otherwise the attack fumbles and this fighter suffers a hit instead (both dice are less than the target's Toughness):

- S and D1 (use the attacker's Strength).

:::danger House Rule (Necrodamus, A&A)
Can be used instead of a Fight action, so it can be used in combination with a Charge.
:::

### 5. Hurl

Can spend a Basic action (Hurl) to target an enemy fighter:

- Engaged: B2B.
- Seriously Injured: Within 1”.
  The enemy fighter must pass an Initiative or be hurled:
  1.Choose a direction.
  2.Move the fighter D3” in that direction.
  3.Stop moving if contacting any Standing fighter, vehicle or terrain.
  The hurled fighter (and any model contacted) suffer the following:
- S3 hit.
- Pinned (fighters only).

:::danger House Rule (Necrodamus, A&A)
Can be used instead of a Fight action, so it can be used in combination with a Charge.
:::

### 6. Iron Jaw

+2T against unarmed attacks in close combat.

## Combat

### 1. Combat Master

Ignore interference and always grant assist.

### 2. Counter-Attack

+1 Attack when making Reaction attacks for each of the attacker’s attacks that failed to hit (whatever reason, parry, missed, etc).

### 3. Disarm

Melee weapons gain Disarm (if hitting on a 6+, the target can't use any weapons when making Reaction attacks for the rest of the round - use unarmed attacks instead). If a weapon already has Disarm, the target is disarmed on a 5+ (instead of 6+).

### 4. Parry

Apply one additional Parry as though carrying a weapon with that trait (parry one additional attack).

### 5. Rain of Blows

Fight (Basic) action becomes Fight (Simple) action instead.

:::danger House Rule (Necrodamus, A&A)
Allow the fighter to make 2 consecutive Fight actions when charging (and potentially receiving 2 reaction attacks as well).
:::

### 6. Step Aside

If hit in close combat, pass an Initiative test to avoid the hit. Can only be used once per enemy in each round of close combat (if an enemy makes more than 1 attack, only 1 attempt can be made to step aside).

## Cunning

### 1. Backstab

Close combat weapons gain Backstab. If a weapon already has Backstab, add +2 Strength instead instead of +1.

:::danger House Rule (Necrodamus, A&A)
If benefiting from this skill, apply an additional -1 AP.
:::

### 2. Escape Artist

Add +2 to the Initiative test when making a Retreat action (a result of 1 before modifiers always fails). If Captured and equipped with a skin blade, add +1 to the result of the dice roll to see if they can escape.

### 3. Evade

If Active and not in partial or full cover, add a -1 modifier to incoming Short range attacks and -2 modifier to Long range attacks.

### 4. Infiltrate

This fighter may be placed aside instead of being set up at the start of a battle. Immediately before the start of the first round, set up this fighter anywhere on the battlefield outside 6” and LOS of any enemy fighters. If both gangs have fighters with this skill, take turns, starting with the winner of a roll-off.

:::danger House Rule (Necrodamus, A&A)
In some scenarios, this is problematic. Make 2 move actions before the 1st round instead.
:::

### 5. Lie Low

Can't be targeted by ranged attacks while Prone, unless within the Short range. Weapons without Short range are unaffected by this rule.

### 6. Overwatch

If Ready and Active, a visible enemy model’s action can be interrupted as soon as it is declared (before being carried out). Lose the Ready condition, then immediately make a Shoot (Basic) action against that enemy. If the target is Pinned or Seriously Injured, their activation ends immediately - their action is not made. Note: Cannot be used with template weapons.

## Ferocity

### 1. Berserker

+1 Attack when Charging.

### 2. Fearsome

When charged, the enemy must first pass a Willpower test before moving, or their action ends immediately.

### 3. Impetuous

Consolidate up to 4” instead of 2”.

:::danger House Rule (Necrodamus, A&A)
If eligible, can both Coup de Grace and Consolidate after a Fight action.
:::

### 4. Nerves of Steel

Pass a Cool test when hit by a ranged attack to avoid Pinning.

### 5. True Grit

When Injured, roll one less Injury dice. If an attack only has Damage 1, roll two Injury dice and discard one before resolving the effects.

### 6. Unstoppable

Before making Recovery test, roll a D6. On a 4+, either remove one Flesh Wound, or if there is no Flesh Wound, roll one additional dice for the Recovery test and choose one to discard.

## Leadership

### 1. Commanding Presence

Group Activation (+1).

### 2. Inspirational

If a friendly model within 6” fails a Cool test, pass a Leadership test to treat the original Cool test as passed.

### 3. Iron Will

-1 modifier to any Bottle rolls while on the battlefield and not Seriously Injured or Wrecked.

### 4. Mentor
Each time another friendly model within 6" gains 1XP, this model can pass a Leadership test to have the other model gain 2XP instead.

### 5. Overseer (Any/Faction Only)

Can spend a Double action (Order) if Active or Mobile to target a friendly fighter within 6" to immediately activate and make 2 actions (as if it was the target's own turn).

- Any (default): Can target any friendly fighter.
- Faction only: Can only target friendly Faction fighters.

This is regardless of whether the target is Ready or not and does not affect the target's Ready status.

:::danger House Rule (Necrodamus)
Can only make Move (Simple) and Stand Up (Basic) actions.
:::

:::danger House Rule (A&A)
Take a leadership test before applying.
:::

### 6. Regroup

If Active or Mobile at the end of the activation, pass a Leadership test to recover all friendly models within 6” from Broken.

## Savant

### 1. Ballistic Expert

When making an Aim (Basic) action, pass an Intelligence test to gain an additional +1 to hit.

:::danger house rule (Necrodamus, A&A)
Can pre-measure the distance to one enemy fighter when aiming.
:::

### 2. Connected

Can make a Trade action in the post-battle sequence in addition to any other actions made (could even make 2 Trade actions). They can't do this if they are not able to make any actions.

:::info Scavenger’s Instinct (Uprising)
In the Uprising campaign, use this instead:

Can make a free Scavenge post-battle action in addition to the normal action (can for example make 2 Scavenge actions). The fighter must still be available in the post-battle sequence as normal.
:::

:::danger house rule (Necrodamus, A&A)
Any fighter can have this skill (not just Leader and Champions). Add +1 to the Rarity/Legality roll. Fighters must decide between this or working Resources. Leaders and Champions can make a post-battle action as normal, if the Trade action is chosen, this would effectively add +2 to the Rarity/Legality roll.
:::

### 3. Fixer

Earn D3x10 credits after a battle as long as this model is not Captured or In Recovery. This model doesn't need to have taken part in the battle.

### 4. Medicae

Re-roll any Out of Action results when assisting a Recovery test (a second Out of Action result stands).

### 5. Munitioneer

Re-roll any friendly failed Ammo test within 6” (including this model).

### 6. Savvy Trader

When making a Trade post-battle action, add 1 to the result and reduce the cost of 1 item by 20 credits. **The cost can't be reduced to less than 10 credits.**

:::Info Savvy Scavenger (Uprising)
In the Uprising campaign, use this instead:

Add 1 or 2 to the result when this fighter makes a Scavenge action. Applies during phase 3 (Damnation).
:::

:::danger house rule (Necrodamus, A&A)
