# Conditions

:::info
You are viewing the archived rules from before the 2023 Core books. Use the menu to navigate to the current rules.
:::

A fighter may be subject to several Conditions at the same time. Some conditions, in particular Out of Ammo, may apply specifically to a weapon the fighter carries rather than the fighter themselves.

Any in-game effect that results in a marker being placed on a fighter should be considered a Condition.

Vehicles are not affected by conditions unless otherwise noted. Normally vehicles are only affected by the following:

- Blaze.
- Blind.
- Broken.
- Concussion.
- Insanity.
- Hidden/Revealed (Pitch Black).

### Blaze

When activated after being hit by a Blaze weapon with a successful Blaze roll (4+):

1. **Suffer a hit**
   - Suffer a Strength 3, AP -1, Damage 1 hit
2. **Move**<br />
   - If Engaged or Seriously Injured, no move is made. Go to step 3.
   - If Pinned, become Active.
   - If Active, move 2D6” in a random direction.
   - Movement stops if contacting impassable terrain.
     - If within ½” of an edge, pass an Initiative test to avoid falling.
     - If moving beyond an edge, fall down.
     - At the end of this move, the fighter can choose to become Pinned.
3. **Roll to put out flames**
   - Roll a D6 with the following modifiers:
     - +2 if Pinned.
     - +1 per friendly Active fighters within 1”.
   - On a 6+, the flames go out.

:::tip YAQ
Inorganic targets are not affected.
:::

Vehicles:

- Suffer a S3, AP-1 hit against Rear Toughness.
- Make a Cool test:
  - Pass: Activate normally.
  - Fail: Act according to Lose Control. If Stationary, make a Burn Out (Double) action. Then the activation ends.
- After the activation, flames go out on a 4+.

### Blind

Models hit by a Flash weapon with a failed Initiative/Handling test:

- If not Ready, do not become Ready at the start of the following round.
- If Ready, lose Ready.
- Reaction attacks only hit on a 6+ (before modifiers).
- No other attacks can be made until the next activation.

### Broken

A result of failing a Nerve test or some cases of Insanity. Can't perform any actions other than Running for Cover (Double) and if Engaged may only make Reaction attacks with a -2 modifier. Make a Running for Cover (Double) action in every activation. Broken fighters may be rallied in the End phase (Cool test with a +1 modifier for each friendly fighter within 3” that is not Broken or Seriously Injured).

### Concussion

When hit by a Concussion weapon:-2 Initiative/Handling (minimum 6+) when hit until the end of the round.

### Gunked

When hit by a Gunked weapon:

- -1” M (minimum 1”).
- Don’t add D3" when Charging.
- -1 modifier to Initiative.
- Blaze trigger on 2+.

### Hidden/Revealed

Related to the Pitch Black special rule.

Vehicles: Become Revealed when moving.

### Insane

Many situations can lead to temporary insanity. When activating, roll a D6:

- **1-2:** Immediately become Broken. Flee if already Broken (even if the gang has not failed a Bottle test).
- **3-4:** An opposing gang (roll-off if multi-player) can control that fighter this turn, treating them as part of their gang. As soon as the activation ends, the Insane fighter no longer counts as being part of the opposing gang.
- **5-6:** The fighter act as normal. Once the activation is over, pass a Willpower test to lose the Insanity

:::danger House Rule (A&A)
Roll a willpower check at the end of activation to see if they become sane.
:::

### Intoxicated

Normally a result of Take A Swig (Simple) action in combination with a bottle of Second Best or Wild Snake. For each token, remove a Flesh Wound and roll a D6 for the effect.

### Out of Ammo

The Ammo symbol on the Firepower dice requires a fighter to make an immediate Ammo test for that weapon. If failed, it is now Out of Ammo and can't be used until reloaded.

_YAQ: If weapons with multiple profiles run out of ammo, Scarce & Limited traits only apply when running out of ammo while using the corresponding profile. Weapons with both ranged and melee profiles can only run out of ammo for the profiles that can actually run out of ammo. Profiles with an Ammo characteristic of “-” can't run out of ammo._

### Ready

The most simple but arguably the most important Condition. At the start of each round, during the Priority phase, all fighters become readied. After activating during the Action phase, they are no longer Ready and may (normally) not be activated again this round.

### Starving

Applies to fighters not given meat portions, normally in Uprising campaign during phase 3 (Damnation).

### Webbed

If wounded by a Web weapon, automatically become Webbed (no save roll or injury roll). Treated as Seriously Injured. Roll for Recovery during the End phase, with the following exceptions:

- Flesh Wound: No longer webbed (but apply the Flesh Wound).
- Seriously Injured: Still webbed.
- Out of Action: No Lasting Injury roll (Out Cold).

After the battle, Webbed fighters don't succumb to their injuries and automatically recover. Each Webbed enemy fighter is added to those eligible for capture and grants a +1 modifier to the capture roll.
