The Priority phase has two steps, first roll-off for Priority, then fighters are Readied.

## Roll for Priority
Roll-off to determine who has Priority. In the case of a tie, the gang with Priority in the previous round passes it to the opponent (re-roll ties the first round, when neither gang has had Priority). In multi-player battles, let dice score determine the order and re-roll any ties.

## Ready Fighters
Each  fighter  is  then  Readied,  regardless  of  Status,  Secondary  Status  or  any  other  Conditions.  Once  a  fighter  has  been activated, they are no longer Ready. Normally a fighter that is no longer Ready may not activate again, but note that there are some instances in which a fighter may activate again.
