## General Principles

### Fighters, Vehicles & Models

In games of Necromunda, players use finely-detailed models to represent their gangs
on the tabletop, and to represent the vehicles of the ash wastes. In game terms, it is
sensible to be quite precise in how such things are defined in order that players can
easily interpret the rules:

- Any model that represents a single humanoid or a single animal is referred to as a ‘fighter’ by the rules. This could be a lowly gang member, a renowned hired gun, or even an exotic beast owned by a mighty gang champion.
- Any model that is mounted on a single-person animal or bike is a fighter subject to the [Mounted condition](/docs/rules/mounts).
- Any model that represents a vehicle of any type, be it a small vehicle operated by a single driver or large vehicle crewed by many, is referred to as a ‘vehicle’ by the rules.
- Battlefield details such as Beast’s Lair are never referred to as models but rather as markers.
- Where the rules use the terms ‘fighter’ or ‘vehicle’, they are referring specifically to models of that type. However, where the rules use the term ‘model’ or ‘models’, they are referring to both fighters and vehicles. Note, however, that vehicle crews may be considered fighters where appropriate.

:::note From the authors

The distinction between fighter and vehicle is applied after 5 years and 20 books and it will take a long time to update all existing rules, so in the meanwhile use some common sense here!

## Vehicle Status

The Status of a vehicle indicates its degree of mobility. The actions available to a
vehicle during its activation will depend heavily upon its current Status. During a
game of Necromunda, a vehicle’s Status can change. This generally represents how
fast the vehicle is moving or, if it has halted, why it has done so, as described below, but may also depend upon other factors.

### Mobile

Whilst a vehicle is ‘Mobile’ it is able to move quite freely around the battlefield, performing a range of actions with ease.

### Stationary

A vehicle that is unable to move for any reason is ‘Stationary’. Whilst Stationary, the
actions available to the vehicle may be dramatically reduced.

### Secondary Status Whilst Stationary

Whilst Stationary, a vehicle will always be subject to one of two Secondary Statuses
as well: ‘Stalled’ or ‘Wrecked’. This Secondary Status essentially explains why the
vehicle is Stationary and will determine how easily it can become Mobile (if at all)
and which actions it can perform during its activation.

**Stalled:** A Stationary vehicle is Stalled if it has been forced to stop moving by
an enemy attack, by damage, or by any other in-game effect or special rule that
prevents the vehicle from moving. Stalled vehicles can often fire their weapons, but
must ‘Restart’ (see [Restart Tests](/docs/rules/vehicles/vehicle-end-phase#restart-tests)) before they can move off.

**Wrecked:** During the course of a battle, a vehicle might become Stationary and
Wrecked due to damage sustained. Once a vehicle is Wrecked, it can no longer
perform any actions and is treated like a piece of terrain.

## Conditions

:::note Vehicles and Conditions

There are a huge number of Conditions in Necromunda; unless stated otherwise
they do not affect vehicles at all.

:::

### Blaze

When activated, a vehicle subject to the Blaze condition suffers an immediate S3, AP -1, D1 hit against the Rear Toughness (roll location as normal, see [Determining Damage](docs/rules/vehicles/vehicle-resolve-hits#4-determine-damage)). They must then make a Cool check:

- If passed, nothing happens; they can continue their activation as normal.
- If failed and the vehicle is Mobile, they act as if they had failed a [Loss of Control test](/docs/rules/vehicles/vehicle-resolve-hits#loss-of-control-tests), then their activation ends.
- If failed and the vehicle is Stationary and Stalled, they must perform the [Burn Out (Double) action](/docs/rules/vehicles/vehicle-actions#burn-out-double) then their activation ends.

At the end of their activation, roll a D6. On a 4+, the flames go out and the Blaze condition is removed.

### Blind

When hit by a weapon with the Flash trait, a vehicle risks becoming Blind (note
a vehicle must pass a Handling check to avoid becoming Blind instead of rolling
against Initiative as a fighter would). A Blind vehicle loses their Ready marker; if they
do not have a Ready marker, they do not gain a Ready marker at the start of the
following round.

### Concussion

Any vehicle hit by a Concussion weapon will suffer a negative -2 penalty to all
Handling checks.

### Hidden/Revealed

Vehicles suffer the same restrictions and have the same triggers for becoming
Hidden/Revealed with the following addition:

If a vehicle subject to the Hidden condition moves, remove from them the Hidden
condition and replace it with the Revealed.

## Vehicle Characteristics

### Move (M)

This is the distance, in inches, the vehicle can move
when making a standard Move action.

### Toughness (Front, Side, Rear)

All vehicles have three Toughness characteristics:
Front, Side and Rear, corresponding to their [vision arcs](/docs/rules/vehicles/vehicle-resolve-hits#vehicle-vision-arcs). This shows how sturdily built a vehicle
is; the higher a vehicle’s Toughness characteristic, the
less likely it is to be damaged by an attack.

### Hull Points (Hp)

A vehicle’s Hull Points characteristic is a measure
of how much punishment it can sustain before it
is Wrecked.

### Handling (Hnd)

This represents how manoeuvrable a vehicle is and
how responsive it is to the crew’s commands. Handling
is used to avoid damage from dangerous terrain, to
determine the success when a vehicle attempts to
ram an enemy vehicle, and even when attempting to
Restart a Stalled vehicle.

### Save (Sv)

This indicates how heavily armoured a vehicle is.

### Ballistic Skill (Bs)

This characteristic represents the proficiency of
the vehicle’s crew with ranged weapons fitted to
the vehicle.

### Leadership (Ld)

A vehicle’s Leadership characteristic represents the
ability of its crew to issue or follow commands in the
heat of battle.

### Cool (Cl)

A vehicle’s Cool characteristic represents the capacity
of its crew for keeping calm under fire.

### Willpower (Wil)

Willpower is a measure of the mental fortitude and
resilience against the horrors of Necromunda shown by
the crew of a vehicle.

### Intelligence (Int)

This represents the mental acuity and ability of the
crew to apply knowledge.

### Modifying Characteristics

Sometimes, the rules will modify a characteristic. If the
characteristic is given as a simple number, the modifier
is applied as written – for example, if a vehicle with
a Front Toughness of 6 is given a +1 modifier to its
Toughness, its Front Toughness counts as 7.

If the characteristic is given as a target number (for
example, a characteristic of 4+ means a dice roll of 4
or higher would be a success), the modifier is applied
to the dice roll rather than the characteristic.

### Characteristic Checks

Players will often be called on to make a characteristic
check for a vehicle – for example, a Ballistic Skill check
is made when a vehicle attacks with a ranged weapon. Characteristics checks are made as follows:

- Ballistic Skill checks are made by making a target number roll on a single D6. If the result is equal to or higher than the characteristic, the check is passed.
- Handling, Leadership, Cool, Willpower and Intelligence checks are made by making a target number roll on 2D6. If the result is equal to or higher than the characteristic, the check is passed.
- To test against a vehicle’s Toughness, roll a D6. If the result is less than or equal to the Toughness characteristic for that facing the test is passed. A natural roll of a 6 is always a fail.

## Vehicle composition

### Parts

A vehicle body includes the following optional parts:

- Upgrade slots (Body, Drive, Engine).
- Wargear.
- Weapon slots (weapon hardpoints).

All vehicles (new & old) can add, remove or replace Upgrades, Wargear and Weapons after each battle. Parts can come from several source:

- Stash.
- The vehicle's equipment list.
- Trading Post & Black Market.

This is the default access (unless noted otherwise):

- Upgrades: Equipment List only.
- Wargear: Equipment List & TP/BM.
- Weapons: Equipment List & TP/BM.

#### Replacing Parts

Old parts can be discarded (returned to Stash) on a 2+ if replaced by a new item of the same type (fulfils a similar purpose). If failed, the replaced item is trashed (suffered too much wear & tear or removed with too much force).

#### Upgrade Slots

Number of upgrade slots available for each part of the vehicle:

- Body.
- Drive.
- Engine.

Each Upgrade item can only be fitted once (unless otherwise noted).

#### Wargear

Vehicles can have any amount of Wargear (note that this must be the separate vehicle Wargear), however no item can be taken more than once (unless otherwise noted) and some may not be combined with others.

#### Weapon Slots

Most vehicles have a number of weapons that can be attached. Some vehicles can add extra slots.

- 0-1 weapon per slot.
- Weapon types:
  - Basic.
  - Special.
  - Heavy.
- A weapon slot can swap or remove its weapon after each battle.

All weapon slots (when buying a vehicle or adding extra slots) must declare the following permanent options (unless otherwise noted) that will affect any weapon while fitted in that slot:

- Designate as crew or passenger operated.
  - Crew operated: Use the crew's BS. Used during the vehicle's activation.
  - Passenger operated: Used by a passenger (during the passenger's activation) within 1" once per round.
- Declare an arc (Front, Left, Right, Rear or all).

Note that the arc is determined by the vehicle's weapon slot, so the same weapon can change arc when fitted to a different weapon slot.

Vehicles ignore the Unwieldy trait.
