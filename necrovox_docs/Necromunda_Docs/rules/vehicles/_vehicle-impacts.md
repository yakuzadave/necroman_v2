# Vehicle Impacts

There are several ways in which vehicles can impact other models, and even terrain. What happens when they do depends upon the nature of the impact.

## Running Over Fighters

If a moving vehicle comes into contact with a fighter’s base, the fighter is moved
by the smallest amount possible to allow the vehicle to pass, ensuring the fighter
does not end up within 1" of the vehicle. Once the vehicle’s movement has been
completed, make an Initiative check for each Standing or Prone and Pinned fighter
moved in this way, applying a +1 modifier if the fighter was Standing. If the fighter is
Seriously Injured, they will only pass this check on a natural roll of a 6.

If this check is passed, the fighter was able to dodge safely aside. If, however, this
check is failed, the fighter immediately becomes Prone and Pinned and suffers an
automatic hit. See the Vehicle Collision Damage table to determine the power of
the hit.

## Vehicle Collision Damage Table

There are many circumstances when a vehicle might collide with another part of
the battlefield, be it another vehicle, a fighter or terrain. When this happens use the
Movement characteristic of the moving vehicle on the table below to determine the
Strength, AP and Damage of the impact.

A vehicle that is Stationary and Stalled but has moved as part of a Jump Start, Turnover, Free Wheel action or as a result of suffering a vehicle collision is assumed to have a Movement characteristic of 3.

| Movement Characteristic | Strength | AP  | Damage |
| :---------------------: | :------: | :-: | :----: |
|           3-5           |    3     |  -  |   1    |
|           6-7           |    5     | -1  |   1    |
|           8-9           |    7     | -2  |   2    |
|           10+           |    9     | -3  |   3    |

## Vehicle Collisions

There are two types of vehicle collisions: head-on and
side-on:

### Head-On Collisions

If, during the course of its movement, a vehicle’s Front arc makes contact with any part of another vehicle, a head-on collision has occurred. When this happens, compare the Toughness value of the impact arcs of the two vehicles:

- If the Toughness of both vehicles is the same, or if the Toughness of the moving vehicle is greater, the impacted vehicle is pushed by the moving vehicle until it reaches the end of its movement.
- If the Toughness of the active vehicle is lower, the active vehicle stops moving immediately.

### Side-On Collisions

If, during the course of its movement, a vehicle’s Side
arc makes contact with any part of another vehicle, a
side-on collision has occurred (generally this will be
either as the result of a failed Loss of Control test or a
vehicle turning). When this happens, make a Handling
check for the active vehicle, applying a +1 modifier if
its Toughness in the impact arc is greater than that of
the other vehicle:

- If the check is passed, the other vehicle is moved by the smallest amount possible to allow the active vehicle to pass.
- If this check is failed, the active vehicle is turned by the smallest amount possible to allow it to continue moving.

### Colliding With Terrain

If a vehicle collides with a wall, an impassable or solid
terrain feature or a sturdy structure, it will likely come
off worse. In such cases, the vehicle is automatically
treated as if it had collided with a vehicle that has a
greater Toughness than it, whilst the terrain will suffer
no damage.

If a vehicle collides with an obstacle or a flimsy
structure, that terrain feature will be destroyed and is
removed from the battlefield. Any fighters on top of it
immediately fall. The vehicle itself is treated as having
collided with a vehicle that has a lower Toughness
than it.

## Vehicle Collision Damage

In either case, once the active vehicle has finished its
movement, both vehicles will suffer an automatic hit.
The Strength, AP and Damage of this hit is determined
by the [Vehicle Collision Damage table](/docs/rules/vehicles/vehicle-impacts#vehicle-collision-damage-table). All
hits are resolved against the Toughness value of the
facing that suffers the hit.

If the Toughness of one of the vehicles is lower,
increase the Strength, AP and Damage of the hit
against it by 1. Applying damage to vehicles is
discussed later (see [Determining Damage](/docs/rules/vehicles/vehicle-resolve-hits#4-determine-damage)).

## Chain Collisions

It is possible (some might even say likely!) that a chain reaction of collisions may occur as vehicles push each
other into rocky outcrops and other battlefield features.

When this happens, fully resolve the damage from each collision in the order they occur. If a subsequent
collision occurs due to a vehicle being pushed, use the initial vehicle’s Movement characteristic when
determining the power of the impact.

Finally, if a vehicle stops due to impacting impassable terrain or a vehicle with a higher Toughness value then
all the vehicles involved in the collision stop.
