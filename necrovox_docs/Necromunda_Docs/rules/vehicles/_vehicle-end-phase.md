# Vehicles in the End Phase

The following additional actions are taken during the End phase of each round.

## Bottle Tests

When checking to see if a gang Bottles add the number of Wrecked Vehicles to the
number of Seriously Injured or Out of Action fighters.

Should a vehicle flee the battlefield, the crew will abandon the vehicle and flee the
battlefield, returning later to collect their vehicle. Change the vehicle’s Status to
Stationary and Wrecked but do not roll on the Lasting Damage table.

## Restart Tests

During the Recovery step, vehicles also test to see if they can restart their engines
and wounded drivers try to recover.

**Restart Tests:** For each vehicle belonging to their gang that is currently Stalled, the
controlling player makes a Restart test. To make a Restart test, make a Handling
check for the vehicle, applying a +1 modifier unless the vehicle has only
1 HP remaining:

- If the Handling check is passed, the vehicle immediately Restarts, changing its
  Status from Stationary and Stalled to Mobile.
- If the Handling check is failed, the vehicle refuses to Restart and it
  remains Stalled.

**Wounded Drivers:** If any vehicles in a player’s gang have suffered a Driver Wounded
damage effect, a D6 is rolled for that driver.

| D6  | Result                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | The driver succumbs to their wounds and passes out. Immediately apply a Driver Black Out result against this vehicle (see below). Do not roll to see if they recover from it this round. |
| 2-3 | The driver grits their teeth and carries on driving through the pain.                                                                                                                    |
| 4-6 | The driver is able to patch up their wounds. Remove one Flesh Wound (and its effects) from the driver.                                                                                   |
