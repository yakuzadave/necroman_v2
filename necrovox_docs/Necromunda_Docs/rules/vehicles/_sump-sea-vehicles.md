# Sump Sea Vehicles

:::note Designer’s Commentary: Battles On The Sump Seas

Presented below are the rules for Sludge Barges, Scrap Skiffs and Sump Sea Environments, allowing you
to recreate the events described in [Apocrypha Necromunda: Spiders of the Sump](https://www.warhammer-community.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ECei4crIwv6QKgzt.pdf). If the Arbitrator wishes, these new rules may be
included in their campaign.

:::

There are almost as many vehicles that ply the sump seas and run-off rivers of Necromunda as there are on its
dusty plains and wind-blasted ridgeways. The following vehicle construction rules can be used alongside the
Wasteland Workshop rules found in Necromunda: Book of the Outlands allowing players to create vehicles
capable of traversing the black seas of Necromunda.

**Note:** Some of the upgrades available to vehicles presented in the Wasteland Workshop might not be
appropriate for Sludge Barges and Scrap Skiffs (such as wheel scythes or tyre claws, for instance), though as
always the Arbitrator can decide which ones they wish to include in their campaign.

### Locomotion Special Rules

**Waterborne:** Waterborne vehicles can only be used in Sump Sea environments (see below). These vehicles
also build up momentum as they move, and can be difficult to turn or slow down quickly. When a Waterborne
vehicle is activated, but before it takes any actions, it must roll for its Drift Movement. Scrap Skiffs Drift D3" directly forward, in the direction they are facing, while Sludge Barges Drift D6" directly forward, in the direction they are facing. Drift Movement does not use any of the vehicle’s actions, though it may still cause collisions, etc.

## Sump Sea Environments

The sump seas, whether they are in the midnight realm beneath a hive or the storm-lashed expanses of the
surface, are deadly and unforgiving environments. If a battle takes place on the sump seas then the entirety of the Battlefield Surface (see Necromunda: Book of the Outlands) is considered to be Sump. The Sump has the following rules:

- Only Waterborne or Skimmer vehicles can traverse the Sump. Tracked, Walker or Wheeled vehicles cannot be fielded in a sump seas environment.
- Fighters subject to the Mounted condition are considered to be riding on small craft, grav-cutters, sump creatures, etc, that can operate in a sump seas environment.
- If, for any reason, a fighter not subject to the Mounted condition starts their activation not on either a piece of terrain or a vehicle with the Waterborne or Skimmer rule (and they themselves do not have a special rule such as flight that allows them to ignore terrain), then they must test to see if they drown (see below).
- As soon as a fighter who is not subject to the Mounted condition falls or moves onto the Sump then their activation ends.
- Fighters on the Sump are considered to be in Full Cover and cannot become Prone and Pinned (note, this
  means that fighters subject to the Mounted condition are not affected by the “I Get Knocked Down…” rule). If a fighter on the Sump ever becomes Prone and Seriously Injured, they are instead taken Out of Action.
- Fighters that fall onto the Sump do not take falling damage.

### Drowning

If a fighter begins their activation on the Sump, they must check to see if they start to drown. Make a Strength check for the fighter. If they pass, they may move D6" in any direction (which may get them back onto a vehicle or terrain piece). If they fail, then they remain in place and suffer a Flesh Wound. In both cases their activation immediately ends.
