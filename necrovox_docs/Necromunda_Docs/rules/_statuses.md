## Fighter Statuses

A fighterâ€™s status dictates what they can or can't do. This will affect what actions are available during activations. Fighter statuses generally represented by how the model is positioned on the table (can also depend on other factors).

### Standing

A fighter that is upright is said to be Standing. A Standing fighter may turn to face any direction when activated, before making actions. A Standing fighter always has a Secondary Status as either Active or Engaged.

#### Standing: Active

A standing fighter is Active if they are not currently Engaged with any enemy fighters. This is the default status for a fighter, and Active fighters have very few restrictions on how they can act.

#### Standing: Engaged

A Standing fighter is Engaged with an enemy if close enough:

- Fighter: Base to Base contact (B2B)
- Vehicle: Within 1".

Note that Versatile weapons allow fighters to Engage enemies in the Versatile range during the attacking fighter's activation.

An Engaged fighter can generally only choose to fight or retreat. An Engaged fighter is always Standing (never Pinned).

Fighters Engaged with vehicles are however not locked in combat and can freely move around or away from the vehicle without having to disengage.

Note that in some cases a fighter may be able to Engage an enemies outside B2B and may act accordingly when activated.

### Prone

A fighter that is laid down is Prone. A Prone fighter has no facing and they effectively have no vision arc. Unless otherwise stated, Prone fighters never block line of sight - they are considered to be well out of the way of action. A prone status is placed face-up or face-down, depending upon their Secondary Status. A Prone fighter always has a Secondary Status as either Pinned or Seriously Injured.

#### Prone: Pinned

Fighters are generally Pinned as a result of being hit by enemy fire, and will need to spend a Stand Up (Basic) action to be Standing (and Active) again. If a Pinned fighter ever comes into B2B with an enemy fighter, automatically make a free Stand Up (Basic) action, becoming Engaged (and Standing), without having to spend an action to do so. A fighter can never be both Pinned and Engaged.

Mounted fighters must pass an Initiative test to Stand Up, otherwise the action is wasted (remain Pinned).

#### Prone: Seriously Injured

A Prone fighter that is laid face-down is Seriously Injured, and can never make attacks. A Seriously Injured fighter is likely to spend at least a few turns on the ground

## Vehicle Statuses

A vehicle's status dictate what they can or can't do.

#### Engaged & Engaging

Vehicles never count as being Engaged and can move freely away from enemy fighters, risking Reaction attacks as normal.

Fighters are Engaged within 1" of enemy vehicles, but are not locked in combat and can freely move around or away from enemy vehicles without having to disengage or risk Reaction attacks.

### Mobile

Able to move.

### Stationary

Forced to stop by any effect or special rule (enemy attack, damage or special rule). Cannot move during its activation. A Stationary vehicle can be either Wrecked or Stalled.

A Wrecked vehicle is also Stationary, but this is equivalent to Out of Action and the vehicle is treated like a piece of terrain.

:::note
The rules will use Stationary as default to refer to Stalled.Wrecked may be referred to as Out of Action.
