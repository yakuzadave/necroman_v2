# Bionics

:::

Bionics are a way to repair damage sustained by fighters as a result of violence and hardship. Not only can Lasting Injuries be negated through the vigorous application of bionics, but the chances of suffering similar injuries in the future can be greatly reduced.

Bionics pieces are used to revert any permanent damage from Lasting Injuries:

- Increasing the damaged stat by 1.
- Can't increase a stat above the maximum.
- Does prevent Recovery (only affects the permanent damage).
- Each bionics can only rectify the damage from a single Lasting Injury (a Lasting Injury damaging 2 stats can't be fixed using 2 bionics).
- Mundane bionics (level 1) can only rectify the damage for 1 stat.
- Improved bionics (level 2) can rectify the damage for 2 stats (from the same Lasting Injury).
- from a single Lasting Injury.

## Location

Each piece can be fitted to 1 of 6 body locations (associated with one or more Lasting Injuries):

- Head Injury (-1 Int & Will) & Humiliated (-1 Cl & Ld)
- Eye Injury (-1 BS)
- Hand Injury (-1 WS)
- Hobbled (-1” M)
- Spinal Injury (-1 S)
- Enfeebled (-1 T)

## Levels

Most bionics have only 1 level, but some have 2:

1. Mundate: Can only rectify 1 stat.
2. Improved: Can rectify 2 stats.Level 2 (Improved) is only relevant for Humiliated (Ld & Cl) and Head Injury (Int & Will).

## Damage

Bionics can protect against future harm, only taking minor damage that can easily be repaired. If a location with a bionic suffers a new subsequent Lasting Injury, roll a D6:

- 1-3: The Lasting Injury is applied as Normal.
- 4+: The effects of the fresh Lasting Injury are ignored. Roll a D6:
  - 1: The bionics are damaged beyond repair and its benefits are lost (the effects of the original Lasting Injury are re-applied).
  - 2+: The bionics take no further damage.

## Archaeo-cyberteknika (Van Saar)

Cyberteknika pieces are used to repair and enhance fighters (similar to bionics). Cyberteknika are permanent (can't be removed later).

#### Level

Each piece has 3 levels (each level grants an unique benefit):

1. Alpha.
1. Gamma.
1. Omega.

Each level is cumulative. Omega includes benefits of Gamma and Alpha. Gamma includes benefits of Alpha.

#### Location

Each piece can be fitted to 1 of 6 body locations (associated with one or more Lasting Injuries):

- Cranial: Head Injury (-1 Int & Will) & Humiliated (-1 Cl & Ld)
- Ocular: Eye Injury (-1 BS)
- Sindextrous: Hand Injury (-1 WS)
- Motive: Hobbled (-1” M)
- Torsonic: Spinal Injury (-1 S)
- Vascular: Enfeebled (-1 T)

#### Purchase

Any Faction fighter can buy a new piece (any level) in the following 3 situations:

- During gang creation (new gang).
  - Leader and Champions (including Specialists) only.
- When gaining an advancement.
  - Any piece.
  - Go into Recovery.
- Repairing a Lasting Injury (after any battle).
  - A piece for the location of the existing injury.
  - Go into Recovery.
  - Replace any Bionics in the same location.
  - Each location can only have a single Cyberteknika.

#### Upgrades

The only way to change an existing piece is to upgrade it:

- Each upgrade can only improve the level by 1 (Alpha → Gamma or Gamma → Omega).
- Can't be upgraded beyond level 3 (Omega).
- The fighter must go into Recovery after each upgrade.
- Pay the difference in cost (between the current level and the next level).

#### Damage

If a fighter suffers a Lasting Injury to a location with a piece:

- The permanent effect (stat decrease) is ignored.
- Go into Recovery (as normal).
- Roll a 4+, or the piece is damaged (no longer grants any benefits). Pay half its cost to repair it (after any battle). **Note:** How is this rounded?!? Rounded up to nearest 5 credits?

:::info Modelling Cyberteknika
These exceptional bionics can be indistinguishable from human limbs and can be added to fighters without requiring any specific modelling. They can still be represented by conversions if desired.
