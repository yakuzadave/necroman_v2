:::info

:::

Fighters that are Engaged with an enemy fighter can make close combat attacks against them.

1. Turn to Face
2. Pick Weapons
3. Determine Attack Dice
4. Declare Targets
5. Make Hit Roll(s)
6. Resolve Hits
7. Reaction Attacks (steps 1 to 5)
8. Consolidate or Coup de Grace

## 1. Turn to Face
The  attacking  fighter  may  turn  to  face  any  direction. However, doing so will apply a -1 hit modifier to all hit rolls.

## 2. Pick Weapons
Declare up to 2 weapons (Melee or Sidearm) or 1 Unwieldy weapon. Alternatively, unarmed attacks can be made instead.

#### Unarmed Attacks
Strength as user, Damage 1.

## 3. Determine Attack Dice
The  number  of  Attack  dice  is  determined  by  the  Attacks characteristics plus the following bonuses:

| Description | Modifier |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Dual Weapons, Sidearm or Melee** | +1 |
| **Charging** | +1 |

If attacking with more than 1 weapon, the Attack dice must be split as evenly as possible, with the attacker choosing which weapon makes any odd attack.

#### Pistols at Close Quarters
A Sidearm can only have one Attack dice allocated to it. Any remaining attacks must be allocated to a Melee weapon (or Unarmed attacks).

Accuracy  modifiers  do  not  apply  to  Sidearms  in  close combat. Sidearms use WS like all other close combat attacks (not BS).

## 4. Declare Targets
Declare a target enemy fighter:
- Engaged with the attacker.
- Within the vision arc of the attacker.

Attacks can be split between multiple targets.

## 5. Make Hit Roll(s)
Make a Weapon Skill test for the attacker with each Attack dice.  Roll  separately  for  different  weapons  and/or  targets. Apply the following modifiers. 

| Description | Modifier |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Broken (Reaction attacks)** | -2 |
| **each Assist** | +1 |
| **each Interference** | -1 |
| **turned to face** | -1 |
| **attacking a vehicle** | +1 |
| **attacking through a barricade** | -1 |

## 6. Resolve Hits
Each attack that scores a hit is resolved using ‘Resolving hits’ rules.

Vehicles: 
- Use  the  facing  the  attacker  is  in  contact  with  to determine Toughness.
- +1 Location dice from close combat attacks (choose 1 result and discard the rest).

## 7. Reaction Attacks
If  there  are  still  enemy  fighters  Engaged  with  the  attacker, each of them can make Reaction attacks, following steps 1-6.

Vehicles: Cannot make Reaction attacks.

:::info N17 (IMPROVED VERSION)
Reaction attacks must target the attacker.
:::

## 8. Consolidate or Coup de Grace
If the attacker is no longer Engaged (all previously Engaged enemy fighters are now Seriously Injured or Out of Action), the fighter can choose one of the following:
- A  free  Coup  de  Grace  (Simple)  action  against  a Seriously Injured fighter in B2B.
- Move up to 2”.

:::tip YAQ
Do not make a 2nd Nerve test for fighters that became Seriously Injured and then taken Out of Action by a free Coup de Grace action in the same activation.
