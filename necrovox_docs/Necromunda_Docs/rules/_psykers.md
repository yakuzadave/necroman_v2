## Psychic Powers
Psykers  are  a  distinct  type  of  fighters  able  to  manifest strange and powerful abilities. Psykers are activated just like any other fighter, with the exception that they may perform ‘Wyrd  Power  (X)’  actions  which  can  be  Simple,  Basic  or Double like any other action. Choose to perform one or more Wyrd Power actions during the activation.

### Disciplines
There are 7 universal Wyrd Power Disciplines:
- Biomancy.
- Chronomancy.
- Divination.
- Pyromancy.
- Technomancy.
- Telekinesis
- Telepathy.

Some Psykers have a personal set of unique Wyrd Powers available  to  them.  If  a  Psyker  doesn't  start  with  any predefined  starting  Wyrd  Powers,  they  can  always  choose from any universal Discipline (Wyrd Powers numbered 1-6).

### Focused
If  a  Psyker  only  has  Wyrd  Powers  from  a  single  universal discipline, gain a bonus from that discipline:
- **Biomancy (Fast Healing):** During Recovery, roll an extra Injury dice then choose one to discard.
- **Chronomancy (Flicker):** Perform one extra action during the activation (once per battle).
- **Divination  (Future  Sight):**  Re-roll  any  dice  roll during the activation, this can be any number of dice or even a roll made by an enemy fighter (once per battle).
- **Pyromancy (Fire Shield):** Immune to Blaze.
- **Technomancy  (Techno-affinity):**  Re-roll  any Ammo test.
- **Telekinesis (Fists of Fury):** Unarmed attacks gain +1 S & D.
- **Telepathy  (Fearful  Aura):**  Enemies  declaring  a Charge  that  would  result  in  attacks  against  this fighter must pass a Willpower test or end the action before moving.

### Gaining Wyrd Powers
The  following  apply  when  recruiting  Psykers  without  any predefined starting Wyrd Powers:
- When  choosing  Wyrd  Powers,  use  the  fighter's predefined lists or any generic Discipline (Biomancy, Chronomancy, Divination, Pyromancy, Technomancy, Telepathy).
- Choose 1 Wyrd Power when hired.
- Choose additional Wyrd Powers as a Primary skill during advancement.

All Psykers are able to perform the following actions:
- **Maintain Control (Simple):** Pass a Willpower test with a +3 modifier to maintain a Continuous Effect (otherwise  it  expires  at  the  start  of  the  fighter's activation).
- **Concentrate (Basic):** +1 modifier to any Willpower test in a subsequent action.

### Ghast
When a Psyker takes a dose of Ghast, a Wyrd Power can be randomized  from  a  predefined  list  or  randomized  from  any chosen universal Discipline.

## Force Weapons
Any Melee weapon can be upgraded into a Force Weapon by buying a Psi-amplifier (75 credits, Rare 15) from the Trading Post) and performing the Psi Attune post-battle action:
- Leaders  and  Champions  must  make  this  action  in the same way as a Trade action and is successful on a 2D6 roll of 15+ (after modifiers).

Force Weapons gain the following when used by a Psyker:
- Power.
- Sever.

## Using Wyrd Powers
When making a Wyrd Power (X) action, make a Willpower test.  If  passed,  the  Wyrd  Power  takes  immediate  effect.  If failed, the action is wasted.

However, using Wyrd Powers is not without risk. 
- If a double 1 or 6 is rolled, immediately roll on the Perils of the Warp table.
- If a double 6 is rolled, the Wyrd Power takes effect and can't be Disrupted.

### Continuous Effects (CE)
Wyrd Powers noted as Continuous Effect have the following abilities:
- Applies  when  the  action  is  successfully  performed (as normal).
- Expires in any of the following situations:
    - At the start of the Psyker's next activation.
    - Psyker is Seriously Injured.
    - Psyker is taken Out of Action.
- Keep the Continuous Effect for another round if the Psyker's  first  action  in  the  following  round  is  a successful Maintain Control (Simple).
- 0-1 CE can be used at a time per Psyker.

## Sanctioned and Unsanctioned
All Psykers fall into two broad types, regardless of the types of power they wield or where they originate from.**Sanctioned:**
- Re-roll a failed Willpower test once per battle.

**Unsanctioned:**
- D3x10 credits to the enemy gang if this fighter goes Out of Action.
- Receive full value when sold to the Guilders.

## Psychic Duels
Whenever  a  Wyrd  Power  or  Maintain  Control  action  is successful, an Active or Pinned enemy Psyker within 18”, can attempt to Disrupt it.

Roll  2D6  to  attempt  to  Disrupt  a  successful  Wyrd  Power action. If the total is higher than the total rolled for the initial Willpower test, the Wyrd Power is Disrupted and fails as if the Psyker making the action had failed their own Willpower test.

However,  Disruption  attempts  can  be  just  as  risky  as manifesting psychic powers.
- If a double 1 or 6 is rolled, immediately roll on the Perils of the Warp table.
- If a double 6 is rolled, the wyrd Power is Disrupted.

### Perils of the Warp
Whenever a double 1 or 6 is rolled when making a Willpower test to perform a Wyrd Power (X) action or attempting to Disrupt a Wyrd Power, roll on the table below:

| &nbsp;&nbsp;2D6&nbsp;&nbsp; | Result |
|:------:|:---|
| **2-3** | **A Tear in Reality!** Centre a 5” Blast on the Psyker, any fighter touched by the blast must pass a Willpower test or lose a Wound. The Psyker goes Out of Action.
| **4-5** | **Immaterium Inverse.** The Psyker becomes target of the power (regardless of range). If the power is beneficial, the Psyker instead becomes Pinned and suffers a Strength 6 Damage 2 hit ignoring armour saves. The power has no other effects.
| **6-8** | **Whispers from the Warp.** The Psyker becomes subject to the Insanity condition. Roll a D6 when they activate:<ul><li> 1-2:  The  fighter  is  immediately  Broken,  if already Broken, they flee (even if their gang has not failed a Bottle test).</li><li> 3-4: An  opposing  gang  (roll-off  if  multi-player) can control the fighter this turn, treating them as part  of  their  gang.  Once  the  turn  is  over,  the fighter no longer counts as part of the opposing gang.</li><li> 5-6: The fighter act as normal. Once their turn is over, pass a Willpower test to lose the Insanity condition</li></ul>
| **9-10** | **Warp Surge!** The Psyker may immediately try to manifest the same power again as a free action, or if trying to disrupt a power, they may immediately manifest on of their own powers as a free action - this additional manifestation can trigger Perils of the Warp as normal. After working out the effects of the power, the Psyker becomes Pinned and suffers a Strength 4 Damage 1 hit ignoring armour saves.
| **11-12** | **Daemonic Possession.** Gain +3 Movement, Strength, Toughness, Attacks and 2+ Weapon Skill. Unarmed attacks inflict 2 Damage and have -1 Armour Penetration. In the End phase of the following round, or if the Psyker generates this result again, they go Out of Action.

:::danger House Rule
#### Whisper of the Warp (Necrodamus, A&A)
If the first action causes Insanity, apply Insanity immediately if the fighter makes a 2nd action.
