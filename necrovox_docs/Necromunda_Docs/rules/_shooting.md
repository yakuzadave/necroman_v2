# Shooting

:::info
You are viewing the archived rules from before the 2023 Core books. Use the menu to navigate to the current rules.
:::

Steps when shooting:

1. Declare the shot
2. Check the Range
3. Make the Hit Roll
4. Target is Pinned
5. Resolve Hits

## 1. Declare the Ranged Attack

Pick a ranged weapon, then pick an eligible target.

### Target Priority

- Must target the closest visible enemy (even if Engaged).
- Can target a more distant enemy if easier to hit.
- Can ignore Seriously Injured enemies.
- Pass a Cool test to target a more distant enemy

:::danger House Rule (Necrodamus, A&A)
Must target the closest visible enemy (regardless of facing). Avoids facing fighters in awkward directions to circumvent the cool Check for seeing the actual closest enemy.
:::

### Fighters in Hiding

A fighter that is both Prone (Pinned or Seriously Injured) and in cover (partial or full) can't be targeted.

## 2. Check the Range

Measure the range from the attacker to the target. If beyond the weapon’s Long range, the attack automatically misses. The Firepower dice must still be rolled.

## 3. Make the Hit Roll

Make a BS test with modifiers:

| Description                                                       | Modifier               |
| :---------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------- |
| Partial Cover                                                     | -1                     |
| Full Cover                                                        | -2                     |
| Accuracy Modifier                                                 | +/-?                   |
| Engaged                                                           | -1                     |
| Prone                                                             | -1, at Long range only |
| Hull Down (Vehicle): If the entire side that is hit is invisible. | -2                     |

### Improbable Shots

If the hit modifiers applied to a ranged attack mean that it is impossible to score a hit, the attack is an improbable shot (for example 7+).

First roll to hit on a 6+, then roll again using only the fighter’s Ballistic Skill and ignoring any modifiers.

## 4. Target is Pinned

When a Standing Active fighter is hit by a ranged attack, they are automatically Pinned. Note that Engaged fighters can't become Pinned.

## 5. Resolve Hits

Each attack that scores a hit is resolved using ‘Resolving hits’ rules.

Vehicles: The Toughness depends of the arc the attack originates from (for example the centre of a blast). Use the higher value if in doubt.

## Stray Shots

If a ranged attack misses, there is a chance that other fighters (friend & foe) will be hit:

- Any fighters Engaged with the target.
- Within 1” of the measured line (between attacker and target).

If the attack misses, roll a D6 for each fighter that is at risk of being hit, starting with the fighter closest to the attacker.

- **1-3: Hit** - The fighter is hit by the attack instead of the target.
- **4-6: Miss** - Move on to the next fighter at risk of being hit.

If the attack would have caused more than one hit, follow this sequence for every hit.

:::danger House Rule (Necrodamus, A&A)
Stray shots only hit other fighters on a 6+.
:::

## Fighters in Hiding

For Ranged attacks, an attacking fighter can't target an enemy if the enemy is both Prone and in cover (they are assumed to be out of sight).

## Twin Guns Blazing

A fighter with 2 sidearms can attack with both as part of a single Shoot (Basic) action.

- Make hit rolls for each weapon before resolving any successful hits.
- Must be made against the same target.
- -1 to hit.

## The Firepower Dice

Roll a Firepower dice when making an attack with a ranged weapon (including Sidearm in close combat). This applies even if the hit roll isn’t made (for example if the target is out of range).

If the Ammo symbol is rolled, roll a D6 to make an Ammo test for the weapon. If failed, the weapon itself becomes subject to the Out of Ammo condition after resolving the attack. If the weapon has more than one profile, all are considered to have failed an Ammo test.

The weapon can't be used until a successful Reload (Simple) action has been performed, using any one of the weapon’s available profiles.

## Shooting When Pinned

A Pinned fighter can make a Blind Fire (Double) action to make a shooting attack.

:::tip Action
**Blind Fire (Double)**<br />
Make a ranged attack, treating their vision arc as 360°. Subtract 2 from the result of any hit rolls
:::

## Blast Markers

When attacking with any weapon with the Blast (X) trait (using the 3” or 5” Blast), the target may be a point on the battlefield instead of an eligible enemy fighter.

Place the Blast so that the central hole is anywhere within line of sight. Blasts ignores Pitch Black.

If the central hole is beyond the Long range, the attack still goes ahead, but the Blast is moved directly back towards the attacking fighter until the central hole is within range.

Roll to hit as normal:

- **Hit:** The Blast stays where it is.
- **Otherwise:**
  - Scatter D6” in a random direction.
  - Stop if the central hole comes in contact with a wall, structure or impassable terrain.
  - If the centre leaves the battlefield, the Blast is removed.

Each fighter (friend & foe) whose base is beneath the Blast is hit by the attack (unless there is a wall or solid terrain between them and the centre of the Blast).

Note that after scattering, the Blast may end beyond the weapon’s range or out of line of sight.

If the centre of the blast leaves the battlefield, the blast is removed.

### Misfires

If the Scatter dice and D6 results in a ‘Hit’ and 1, something has gone wrong. Roll another D6:

- **1:** Centre the Blast over the attacking model.
- **2-6:** The shot is a Dud and the attack ends.

## Blasts, Templates and Cover

Fighters hit by Blasts and Templates may gain a positive modifier to their save roll if they are in cover:

- **Full cover:** +2
- **Partial cover:** +1

Whether the target hit is in cover or not depends on the type of attack:

- **Blasts:** relative to the central hole of the Blast.
- **Template:** relative to the attacking model.

Note that these modifiers can't be applied to Field armour.

## Flame Templates

Weapons with range T (Template) use the Flame template to determine which fighters are hit by the attack.

Instead of targeting an enemy, place the template so that the narrow end is touching the front of the attacker’s base and the entire template is within their vision arc.

Templates ignore all LOS (Pitch Black, Smoke).

Each fighter (friend & foe) whose base is beneath the template is hit automatically by the attack (unless there is a wall or solid terrain in between). Resolve the hits in an order of the attacker’s choice.

:::danger House Rule (Necrodamus, A&A)

#### Blast/Template and Target Priority:

- **Target Priority:** Must pass Priority test or touch closest fighter (except Smoke!).
- **Engaged Fighters:** If an Engaged fighter is hit, any other fighters Engaged with the hit fighter are also hit on a 4+.

#### Pitch Black & Smoke (outside the fighter’s view distance, normally 3”):

- Blasts automatically scatter:
  - Short range: D6” (or firing into a smoked area).
  - Long range: 2D6”.
- Templates only hit on 4+.
