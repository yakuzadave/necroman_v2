# Movement

:::info
You are viewing the archived rules from before the 2023 Core books. Use the menu to navigate to the current rules.
:::

Fighters move by making actions, usually the Move (Simple) action. To run, make 2 Move (Simple) actions. A fighter might Charge (Double) to get into combat, or Crawl (Double) to get out of the firing line.

A  fighter  can  move  up  to  (but  not  further)  than  the  full movement allowance. The movement can bend and curve in any fashion (need not be in a straight line). Note that a Charge (Double) action should take the shortest route possible. After moving, a fighter can turn to face any direction. 

All  Move  actions  must  be  declared  before  any  measuring  is carried out. If a measurement makes it obvious that a fighter does not have as much movement as hoped, the movement will end short of where it was planned. In this case, move the fighter  as  far  as  possible  in  the  desired  direction,  and  try  to make good use of any available cover!

In  the  case  of  a  Charge  (Double)  action,  if  a  fighter  has insufficient  movement  to  make  it  into  B2B  with  an  enemy fighter, they must still move the full distance (stopping 1” away, as  follows)  and  may  often  end  their  movement  in  a  very dangerous position!

:::tip YAQ
Fighters  can  move  (voluntarily)  through  friendly  fighters (if having sufficient movement to not overlap any bases).
:::

### Directly Towards and Directly Away From
Trace an imaginary straight line that crosses the centre of each fighter’s  base  -  the  moving  fighter  then  moves  towards  the other fighter along this line the required distance. Similarly, to move  directly  away  from  another  fighter,  follow  the  same method in the opposite direction.

As  always,  this  can't  make  a  fighter  move  through  a  wall, impassable terrain or a closed door. Should they contact one of these features, they stop and do not move further.

## The 1" Rule
Move within 1" of any enemy fighter during an activation:
- Fighters: Can't move.
- Vehicles: Can move (any enemy model).

Fighters have some exceptions to this rule:
- Enemy fighter is Seriously Injured.
- An Active fighter makes a Charge (Double) action.
- Involuntary move.

### Charge
During a Charge, a fighter can move within 1” of one or more enemy fighters, provided the move ends B2B with one or more enemies.  If  the  move  is  sufficient  to  get  within  1"  but insufficient to get in B2B and Engage the enemy fighter, stop moving 1” away. Note that with Versatile, the move can stop within Long range.

:::danger House Rule
Fighters can move (voluntarily) to Engage enemies (B2B)
:::

### Involuntary Move
The 1” rule does not apply when moving involuntarily within 1” of an enemy. For example when thrown into contact with other fighters. The normal rules described previously are temporarily suspended until the movement and any other effects it causes have  been  fully  resolved  (such  as  in  the  previous  Hurl example, in which case the fighters would suffer hits as a result of coming B2B with one another). Once they have been and if neither fighter is Prone and Seriously Injured, move the fighter that  was  involuntarily  moved  by  the  shortest  route  possible until they are 1” away from the enemy fighter.

## Terrain
The following section covers how terrain affects movement.

### Difficult Terrain
Every 1” movement count as 2”.

### Dangerous Terrain
Dangerous Terrain is Difficult Terrain. In addition, an Initiative test must be passed to avoid immediately going Out of Action and suffering a Lasting Injury roll.

### Obstacles
Obstacles are free standing terrain no more than 2” high and 2” across (such as pipelines, barricades and barrels). Fighters may cross obstacles as they move, but doing so reduced their movement by a number of inches equal to the height of the obstacle. A fighter may not end their movement on top of an obstacle.

### Structures
Structures  are  terrain  features  more  than  2”  high  and  more than 2” across. A fighter may climb up and onto structures and between various levels and platforms as they move and may end their movement on any level if there is sufficient space for their base.

### Impassable and Solid Terrain
Fighters may not move across impassable terrain.

### Ductways
Ductways can be up to 2” in length and can be placed across any  2”  wide  wall  or  any  other  impassable  terrain.  Spend  a Double action (Crawl Through) within 1":
- Placed  within  1"  of  the  other  end  (provided  there  is room  outside  1"  of  enemies  and  the  base  doesn't overlap other fighters or obstacles).

### Climbing
Climbing  is  equal  to  moving  through  Difficult  Terrain.  Any vertical  surface  can  be  climbed.  A  fighter  can't  end  the activation  mid-climb;  they  must  have  sufficient  movement  to reach  a  flat  surface.  If  they  can't,  they  will  stay  where  they were when the action was declared.

Note that a fighter may end a Move (Simple) action mid-climb, provided that they are able to immediately use another action to complete the climb.

### Stepping Up
A fighter may freely ‘step up’ onto another level or platform of a structure, provided it is no more than ½” higher than the level they are currently on. If the difference in height is more than ½”, they must climb instead.

### Overhangs
Overhangs can be traversed as long as it protrudes no more than 1” from the vertical surface. Overhangs that protrude more than 1” are considered impassable when climbing.

### Ladders and Stairs
Normal movement.

### Lift
If moving onto a lift, the lift can go 4" up or down. The fighter can then use any remaining movement. The lift can only move once per round. Any models standing on it moves with it.

If a fighter moves a lift while another fighter obstructs the path of the lift, the other fighter must pass an Initiative test to move up to 2" away from the lift. If failed, or having insufficient move to escape the lift, suffer an automatic hit with automatic wound with a D3 attack. If the attack was survived, move the fighter the shortest distance possible to no longer obstruct the lift.

### Leaping Gaps
A fighter may attempt to leap across a gap that is bigger than their base, provided there is enough Movement to do so. Stop at  the  edge  and  pass  an  Initiative  test  to  leap  the  gap  and continue  moving.  If  failed,  fall  straight  down  by  the  shortest possible route to the next level down and suffer a hit as follows.

### Jumping Down
Pass  an  Initiative  test  to  jump  down  to  a  lower  level.  No modifier for the first 2”, but a cumulative -1 modifier for each additional  2”  jumped  (rounded  up).  If  failed,  suffer  falling damage.

:::info N17
The vertical distance does not cost any movement.
:::

## Falling Hazards
A fighter is at risk of falling if they go from Standing to Prone whilst within ½” of the an edge. Pass an Initiative test to avoid falling.

### Railings
If the nearest edge of a level or platform is bounded by a railing or similar barrier at least ½“ tall, the chance of falling is reduced:
- +1 to Initiative tests. (when going Prone to see if the fighter falls).

### Falling Damage
If a model falls 3” or more, suffer an automatic hit (round up to the nearest inch).

A falling fighter is immediately Pinned and their activation ends. 

If falling and landing within ½” of a platform edge, pass another Initiative test or fall again.

Vehicles:
- Automatically suffer fall damage (no test to avoid it).
- Pass   a   Handling   test   (with   falling   modifiers) or Lose Control.

### Falling on Other Models
If a model lands on top of another model, both suffer the same damage.
- Fighters: All involved are Pinned.

Move the falling model the shortest possible distance so it is not overlapping (if neither went Out of Action). If falling on an enemy fighter  (and  no  involved  fighter  is  Seriously  Injured),  move  the falling  model  1"  away  from  the  enemy  fighter  (shortest  possible route)

## Vehicle Movement

### Fighter Movement
Fighters can move and climb on and leap onto vehicles.

### Fighters & Loot on Moving Vehicles
Fighters  that  are  on  a  vehicle  when  it  moves  must  pass  an Initiative test (only test once per activation in which the vehicle moves) or fall 1" away from the vehicle in a random direction. If landing  within  ½"  of  an  edge  of  a  platform,  pass  another Initiative test to avoid falling again. If the landing location is in impassable  terrain,  move  the  shortest  distance  to  a  legal location.

Loot on top of a vehicle will fall off a moving vehicle unless any of the following are true:
- B2B with a fighter (that passed the Initiative test).
- Placed in a designated transport area.

## Vehicle Collisions
Vehicles can crash into other models (fighters & vehicles) or terrain.  Collisions  occur  when  a  moving  vehicle  contacts another model or terrain. When calculating the Toughness of a vehicle involved in a collision, use the facing that suffers the hit.

### Collision Damage
Use the moving vehicle's Move stat to determine the damage:

<table>
    <tr>
        <td><b>3-5:</b></td><td>S3.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>6-7:</b></td><td>S5, AP-1.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>8-9:</b></td><td>S7, AP-2, D2.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>10+:</b></td><td>S9, AP-3, D3.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>●</b></td><td>+1S,  AP  &  D  to  a  vehicle  with  lower  Toughness (than another vehicle in the collision).</td>
    </tr>
</table>

A vehicle that makes a Ram (Double) action causing a head-on collision with another vehicle or terrain halves the movement when  determining  the  damage  it  suffers  (but  not  for  other affected vehicles).

Stationary  vehicles  count  as  having  M3"  if  having  moved  as part of the following:
- Jump Start.
- Turn-over.
- Free Wheel.
- Suffering a vehicle collision.

### Running Over Fighters
If a moving vehicle contacts a fighter:
1. The fighter is moved the shortest distance possible to allow the vehicle to pass (1" away from the vehicle).
2. The fighter must pass an Initiative test:
    - Standing: +1 modifier.
    - Pinned: Normal.
    - Seriously Injured: 6+ (regardless of Initiative).
    
    If failed, suffer a hit using Vehicle Collision Damage.

### Move and Push During Collisions
If a moving vehicle contacts other vehicles, all involved vehicles suffer  a  hit  after  the  move  is  finished.  When  calculating Toughness, use the facing that suffers the hit.

How vehicles move during collisions depends on which arc of the moving vehicle contacted the other vehicle:
- **Head-on (front):** The moving vehicle's front contacts another vehicle.
    - The impacted vehicle is pushed until the moving vehicle stops moving (unless the moving vehicle has a lower Toughness, in which case it stops immediately).
- **Side-on (side):** The moving vehicle's side contacts another vehicle.
    - Make a Handling test (+1 modifier if the moving vehicle  as  a  higher  Toughness).  The  result affects  which  vehicle  is  moved  the  shortest distance possible to continue moving.
        - Pass: The other vehicle.
        - Fail: The moving vehicle.
        
### Chain Collisions
- If multiple vehicles collide, fully resolve the damage from each collision in the order they occur.
- If  subsequent  collisions  occur  due  to  a  vehicle  being pushed,  use  the  initial  vehicle's  Movement  stat  to determine the power of the impact.
- If a vehicle stops due to impacting impassable terrain or a  vehicle  with  higher  Toughness,  then  all  the  vehicles involved in the collision stop.

### Colliding with Terrain
When a vehicle contacts terrain, it counts as colliding with another vehicle. The collision damage depends on the type of terrain. The relative Toughness of the terrain is determined as follows:
- Solid terrain (wall, impassable terrain, sturdy structure):Terrain has highest Toughness (but takes no damage). This causes the vehicle to stop.
- Obstacle (flimsy structure):Terrain  has  lower  Toughness.  It  is  removed  from  the battlefield. Any fighters on top of it immediately fall
