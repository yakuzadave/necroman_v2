# Generating Ash Wastes Battlefield Conditions

_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

Battles in the ash wastes are a far more dangerous
affair than those within the underhive. Away from the
protection of the hives, gangers are exposed to the full
fury of Necromunda’s apocalyptic environment where
the ground itself is not safe. However, the rewards for
surviving out in the wastes make it so that many still
risk it.

Fighting in the ash wastes is a very different
experience to battling it out in the confines of a hive
city. To represent this unique environment, players are
encouraged to use the special battlefield conditions
presented here, as they reflect the true perils of the
wastes, and will offer gangs and fighters a new set
of challenges. Two factors determine what kind of
battlefield rules will be in effect during an Ash Wastes
battle: Region and Season. Region is the type of
Battlefield Surface on which the fight is taking place
and includes the Near Wastes, Deep Wastes and Wild
Wastes. Season represents the atmospheric conditions
in effect and includes the Season of Flame, Season of
Ash and Changing Seasons.

After choosing a scenario, during the
pre-battle sequence, players that decide their battle
is taking place in the ash wastes should determine
Region and Season. There are three ways this can be
done depending on the kind of battle being played:

- If this is a skirmish battle, or no special guidelines
  apply, players may either roll a D6 to determine
  Region and a D6 to determine Season, and then
  roll on the respective tables to see what battlefield
  conditions are in effect.
- Alternatively, if players want a more reliable outcome
  then they can either choose the Region and Season
  and their effects from the tables that follow, or roll
  a D6 to determine Region and a D6 to determine
  Season then count the result on the tables as a 6-8.
- Finally, if the players are part of a campaign or are
  playing a specific scenario then the Arbitrator or
  the scenario may specify which Region and Season
  conditions are in effect.

## The Battlefield Surface

The ash wastes are made up of countless
environments, each with its own perils. These perils
tend to affect the entirety of a battlefield, unlike normal
terrain or areas of difficult terrain that might affect only
a small portion. This is reflected by the concept of the
Battlefield Surface. The Battlefield Surface is the entire
surface area in which the battle is being played, and
includes all areas where the battlefield is not covered
by a piece of terrain. Terrain itself might be considered
part of the Battlefield Surface if it is especially low, though this will be noted in any rules that affect the
Battlefield Surface.

The rules for Regions typically apply to the Battlefield
Surface, meaning they will affect any fighter or vehicle
on the battlefield unless it is somehow protected or
elevated by terrain.

### Roads

Roads are a special kind of battlefield terrain that
can be represented either by placing actual terrain on
the battlefield or marking out part of the Battlefield
Surface as counting as a road. These pieces of terrain
are important to the commerce and livelihood of the
ash wastes and players are encouraged to include at
least one road on their battlefield, unless it is taking
place in the heart of a settlement or out in the Deep
Wastes. Typically, a road will be 6"-8" wide and run
from one battlefield edge to another. Unless otherwise
noted, any rules that apply to the Battlefield Surface
do not apply to roads, as they have been specifically
constructed to allow safe passage across otherwise
dangerous terrain.

## Regions

The ash wastes cover vast areas of Necromunda and
fill the empty wilds between the towering hive cities. Only the ignorant believe the wastes are uniform
across all of Necromunda. In reality there is a huge
variety of wasteland environs ranging from rolling
ashen dunes, burning salt flats and bubbling tox
rivers to diamond-hard ironflats, glittering scrap-seas
and refuse-laden mountain ranges. While there are
hundreds of classifications and names for these
different areas, most Necromundans group them into
three broad categories: the Near Wastes, the Deep
Wastes and the Wild Wastes.

### Near Wastes (D6 Result – 1-2)

The Near Wastes are those areas close to the hives, usually within a hundred kilometres or less; the hive
or hives looming upon the horizon. Areas in the Near
Wastes benefit from being tamer than most as they
have higher numbers of settlements and people eager
to scavenge through the hive’s cast-off waste. The Near
Wastes also tend to be more developed, as transport
hubs and roads criss-cross their surface, while the
thermal bleed from the hive makes the environment
more pleasant (or less unpleasant) to live in.

| :-------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|        2        | **Sand Traps:** The Battlefield Surface is covered in shifting sand, and counts as difficult terrain for vehicles. In addition, horrors lurk beneath the dunes, place an additional Beast's Lair on the battlefield after both crews have [deployed](/docs/battlefield-setup/scenario-rules#deployment). |
|       3-5       | **Broken Ground:** The Battlefield Surface is covered in cracks and small fissures, and counts as difficult terrain for vehicles.                                                                                                                                  |
|       6-8       | **Open Ground:** The Battlefield Surface is mostly hardpan and counts as open terrain.                                                                                                                                                                             |
|      9-11       | **Rocky Fields:** The Battlefield Surface is littered with small rocks and stones, and counts as difficult terrain for vehicles. In addition, fighters on the battlefield surface count as being in partial cover if they did not move in their last activation.   |
|       12        | **Sunken Ruins:** The Battlefield Surface lies over ancient ruins and all models count the battlefield surface as dangerous terrain.                                                                                                                               |

### Deep Wastes (D6 Result – 3-4)

Far from the hives are the Deep Wastes. These are
the abandoned and forgotten areas of Necromunda
where only ghosts and scavengers haunt the ruins of
fallen hives, shattered mountains and the dry seabed. Here and there remote settlements might eke out an
existence, but these are places where travellers do
not like to linger. Without the shelter of nearby hives, the Deep Wastes are also more prone to storms and
Necromunda’s ever present howling winds – their
sound is constant as they scour the landscape.

| &nbsp;2D6&nbsp; | Result                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| :-------------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
|        2        | **Ancient Roads:** The Battlefield Surface is part of an ancient road network and counts as open terrain. In addition, wheeled or tracked vehicles add 2" to their movement when travelling on the road.                                                                                                                        |
|       3-5       | **Shifting Dunes:** The Battlefield Surface is deep dunes of toxic dust and ash, and counts as difficult terrain. In addition, models that do not move during their activation suffer a Wound or lose a Hull Point as they begin to sink!                                                                                       |
|       6-8       | **Rolling Ash:** The Battlefield Surface is baked ash flats and counts as open terrain. In addition, models that move more than 6" during their activation count as having partial cover until their next activation as they kick up great clouds of dust and ash. If using the Sentries rules, this will also Raise the Alarm. |
|      9-11       | **High Dunes:** The Battlefield Surface is atop a volatile and potentially explosive series of gas pockets. After a model activates, if it moved more than 6" or fired any weapons with a Strength of 5 or more, roll a D6. On a 4+, centre the 5" Blast marker on the model and deal a S4, AP -, D1 hit to any models touched. |
|       12        | **Burning Wastes:** The Battlefield Surface is covered in flammable chems. When a model fires a weapon, roll a D6. On a 6, the model becomes subject to the Blaze condition.                                                                                                                                                    |

### Wild Wastes (D6 Result – 5-6)

As dangerous as the wastes of Necromunda can be, there are some areas that are either utterly deadly or
downright bizarre – or even both! These are the Wild
Wastes, areas of unusual and perilous environmental
hazards which travellers would do well to avoid. Such
areas can equally exist in the furthest reaches of
the planet or under the shadow of a hive city – their
presence a constant reminder of the protection the
hive cities offer, and the terrible toxic nature of the
world on which they exist.

| &nbsp;2D6&nbsp; | Result                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| :-------------: | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|        2        | **Acid Plains:** The Battlefield Surface is highly acidic and any fighter not subject to the Mounted condition that ends their activation on it suffers an immediate S3, AP -, D1 hit.                                                                                                                                      |
|       3-5       | **Toxic River:** The Battlefield Surface is the crust over a toxic river and it counts as both difficult terrain and dangerous terrain. In addition, fighters and vehicles with a Toughness characteristic of 5 or more apply a -1 modifier to their Initiative or Handling tests to see if they trigger dangerous terrain. |
|       6-8       | **Dead Seabed:** The Battlefield Surface is an ancient dry seabed littered with salt flats and the bones of dead sea beasts. It counts as dangerous terrain. In addition, place a [Beast’s Lair](/docs/battlefield-setup/scenario-rules#the-beasts-lair) marker on the battlefield.                                                                                    |
|      9-11       | **Crystal Maze:** The Battlefield Surface is part of a crystalline maze that dazes the senses and can drive the unwary to madness. Models that move more than 6" during their activation must pass an Intelligence test or gain the Insane condition.                                                                       |
|       12        | **Sea of Glass:** The Battlefield Surface is a reflective expanse of cracked glass. Weapons with the Blast trait increase their Strength and Damage by 1. In addition, vehicles that moved more than 6" in their previous activation must move at least 3" straight ahead when they activate.                               |

## Seasons

On Necromunda, the atmosphere is forever in turmoil. It is a world held on the
brink of complete and utter environmental collapse, its biosphere long having been
destroyed. Once, millennia ago, the world had Ancient Terra-like seasons, ranging
from warm and kind summers, to brisk, snow-laden winters. Now there are only two
major seasons on Necromunda: the Season of Flame and the Season of Ash – both
of which are brutal and extremely hazardous to life. Caught between these two great
seasons are numerous lesser seasons that occur sporadically, each bringing with it a
new myriad of dangers for travellers and little respite from the hell of the ash wastes.

### Season Of Flame (D6 Result – 1-2)

As Necromunda tilts toward its star, and the solar rays bombard the planet in greater
frequency, the Season of Flame begins. During this great cycle, the temperature of
the planet soars and chemical changes occur across its wastelands. Some areas
catch fire, while others harden into gleaming diamond oceans that can cut a vehicle
to scrap in seconds. The greatest danger from the Season of Flame comes from
the heat, and travellers without adequate protection can burn alive if outside for
too long.

|        2        | **Thermal Thunder:** Roiling storm clouds mean the Visibility (18") rule is in effect. In addition, whenever a model activates roll a D6 – on a 1 that model suffers a S5, AP -, D1 hit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|       3-5       | **Soaring Temperatures:** Shimmering curtains of heat mean the Visibility (24") rule is in effect. In addition, fighters without respirators treat the Move (Simple) action as a Basic action.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|       6-8       | **Yellow Skies:** Clear(ish) yellow clouds hang over the battlefield. No effect.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

In addition, fighters with a 6+ armour save or no armour save take a S2, AP -, D1 hit at the end of their activation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|       12        | **Firestorm:** Gouts of flame erupt from the battlefield as chemicals are ignited by the heat, meaning the Visibility (18") rule is in effect. At the start of each round, each player places two 3" Blast markers anywhere on the Battlefield Surface and then scatters them 3D6" to see where they end up – these markers are removed at the start of the end phase. Models that begin, end or move across the markers during their activation must test to see if they are set on fire just as if they had been hit by a weapon with the Blaze trait. |

### Season Of Ash (D6 Result – 3-4)

When the planet tilts away from its star, the
temperatures drop as swiftly as they rise and, as they
fall, massive storms boil up in their wake. During the
Season of Ash, the deadly winds of Necromunda blow
ceaselessly across the world, some storms growing
large enough to engulf entire continents. Travel
becomes more perilous as visibility drops to almost nil
in most places and both landmarks and roads vanish
under mountains of ash. It is, however, also a time for
scavenging, as what past storms have hidden, new
storms may uncover.

|        2        | **Ash Cyclone:** A giant ash cyclone races across the battlefield. The Visibility (9") rule is in effect. In addition, at the start of the battle, after both sides have deployed but before the first round, place a marker in the centre of the battlefield. At the start of each End phase, before making Bottle checks, scatter the marker 3D6" (stopping if it comes into contact with a battlefield edge).

|      9-11       | **Caustic Winds:** Acid rain lashes the battlefield, meaning the Visibility (12") rule is in effect, and melting armour and clothing.

|       12        | **Great Storm:** A great ash storm descends upon the battlefield. The Visibility (3") rule is in effect. In addition, at the beginning of each round randomly determine a battlefield edge. Fighters and vehicles moving toward this edge count each 1" moved as 2", while those moving away from this edge count each 2" moved as 1". In the End phase all models are moved D6" directly away from this edge – roll separately for each model.                                                               |

### Changing Seasons (D6 Result – 5-6)

Time between the great seasons can be fleeting, and
those who live in the ash wastes quickly learn not
to trust the so-called lesser seasons that fill these
spaces. During the changing of the seasons, a variety
of strange and equally deadly weather might descend
on a region, settlement or hive. These can range fromrust storms filling the air with the broken-down remains
of hive cities, billowing clouds of radioactive dust
released from the high atmosphere or even perpetual
night as the skies thicken with ash.

|       6-8       | **Blinding Rays:** The clouds are thin enough to let sunlight reach the wastes. Due to rays of blinding sunlight moving across the battlefield, fighters who end their activation outside of a vehicle or enclosed structure must test as if they had been hit by a weapon with the Flash trait. |
|      9-11       | **A Year in a Day:** At the start of each round, before rolling for Priority, the player who had Priority last round rolls a D6.
