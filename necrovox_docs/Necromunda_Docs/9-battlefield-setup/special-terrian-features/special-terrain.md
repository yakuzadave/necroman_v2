# Special Terrain

## Doors

:::info Operate Door (Simple)

Any fighter may can spend a Simple action (Operate Door) to open or close it.

:::

By default, all doors are closed at the start of a battle. Closed doors are considered impassable terrain and solid terrain.

Closed doors, locked or otherwise, can be targeted by attacks and are automatically hit. All doors have:

- Toughness 5.
- 4 Wounds.
  If reduced to 0 Wounds, it is removed from the battlefield.

#### Mind the Doors

If standing in the way of a closing door, pass an Initiative test to move up to 2" to escape the closing door (can't end the move within 1" of an enemy fighter).

If the test failed or the move is insufficient to clear the doorway, suffer the following hit:

- S3 D2 (can be saved as normal).
  If survived, move the shortest distance possible, no longer obstructing the door (if directly between 2 sides, randomize which which side of the door to end up). Can't move within 1" of an enemy unless there is no alternative.

#### Locked Doors and Terminals

A locked door is is represented by having 2 door terminals within 1" of either side of the door.

To open a locked door, spend a Basic action to permanently open the door (unlocked for the rest of the battle):

- **Access Terminal:** If within 1" of a terminal, pass an Intelligence test with a -2 modifier.
- **Force Door:** If B2B with a door, pass roll a D6+S and additional +2 per friendly fighter also B2B with the door:
  - **Door:** 9+ to open.
  - **Vault Door:** 11+ to open.

In scenarios with an attacker & defender, the defending gang is assumed to have the access codes for any locked doors, and can spend a Simple action (Operate Door) as normal.

## Lift

- ACTIVATE/DEACTIVATE (CONTROLLED)

At the start of or during an activation, if a fighter is on the lift, the lift can go 4" up or down (without spending an action). This can be done mid-movement, using any remaining movement after the lift has stopped. The lift can only move once per round. Any models standing on it moves with it.

#### Mind the Lift

If obstructing the way of a moving lift, pass an Initiative test to move up to 2” to escape the lift (can't end the move within 1” of an enemy fighter).

If the test failed or the move is insufficient to clear the lift’s path, suffer a hit causing D3 (no saves allowed). If survived, move the shortest distance possible, no longer obstructing the lift. Can't move within 1” of an enemy unless there is no alternative.

#### Lifts and Terminals

A lift can be remotely activated or deactivated by a control panel with an Access Terminal (Basic) action.

Any fighter hit by the Blast can pass an Initiative test to avoid being hit. Vehicles are not affected.

#### Fuel Slicks
