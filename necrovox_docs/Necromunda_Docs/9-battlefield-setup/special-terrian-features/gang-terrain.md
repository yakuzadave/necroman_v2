# Gang Terrain

Some terrain can be purchased in the Trading Post and added to the gang’s Stash. This terrain can be fielded in any battle the gang takes part in unless noted otherwise.

Gang terrain is placed on the battlefield after other terrain is set up, but before deploying any fighters:

- Deployment zone (default).
- Outside enemy deployment zone (if specified).
- Anywhere (if specified).

Some can only be used if the gang is the defender (in a scenario with an attacker and a defender). Gang Terrain are represented by suitable markers (weapons, relics, traps) depending on type.

## Hidden Traps

Applies to some terrain labeled ‘Hidden Traps’. Represented by 6 traps where one of them is secretly noted as being real. The others are false traps. When one of these traps is triggered it is revealed. False traps are discarded.

Even if the real trap is revealed, the rest remains on the battlefield. This is important if more than one trap is in play, as it will keep the enemy guessing how many traps remain to be discovered.

:::danger House Rule (Necrodamus)

## Scenarios Without Deployment Zones

If a scenario doesn’t include a deployment zone required by a terrain, then it can't be used in that scenario.

## Gang Relics

There are many types of Gang Relics, but they have no universal specification. Here are suggested universal rules for all Gang Relics (based on the original one):

- +D3 XP to a fighter defiling a relic (if no XP reward is specified elsewhere).
- Once defiled, it no longers offers any bonuses to Cool tests and Leadership tests, and can't be wrecked again.

Counts as a Gang Relic:

- +2 Cool & Ld for friendly fighters within 6”.
