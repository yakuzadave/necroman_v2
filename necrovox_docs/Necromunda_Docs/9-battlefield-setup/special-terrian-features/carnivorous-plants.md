# Badzone: Carnivorous Plants

## Destroying Carnivorous Plants

By default, Carnivorous Plants are treated like other terrain and so can't be destroyed. However, the following rules can be applied to allow fighters to clear areas of plant life and remove them from the battlefield.

- 5 wounds.
- Only vulnerable to Template weapons with Blaze or Gas.

If hit, roll a D6:

| D6  | Result     |
| :-: | :--------- |
| 1-2 | No effect. |
| 3-5 | 1 damage.  |
|  6  | 2 damage.  |

:::danger House Rule (Necrodamus)

Also vulnerable to blast weapons (with Gas or Blaze).

## Barbed Venomgorse

#### Barbed Snares

If a fighter moves within 3" during movement (measuring this distance from the plant’s branches), once the movement is completed, pass an Initiative test or suffer a S3 Web hit.

#### Wasting Toxin

In the End phase, a fighter who has taken at least one hit from a Barbed Venomgorse must make a Strength test or gain -1 Strength. If the Strength reaches 0, the fighter goes Out of Action.

## Shardwrack Spines

#### Walls of Spines

If a fighter’s movement takes them within 3" (measuring this distance from the plant’s branches), once the movement is completed, pass an Initiative test or suffer a S2 AP -3 hit.

#### Spitting Spines

In each End phase, roll a D6 for each grove of Shardwrack Spines. On a 4+, it shoots spines at the closest fighter within 12", treated as an autopistol with BS 4+:

- +1 to hit within 4”, S3, Rapid Fire (1).

If the attack scores more than one hit, it must spread these out to as many models as possible. This attack can't run out of ammo.

## Grapple Weed

#### Crawling Horror

In each End phase, each section of Grapple Weed moves 2D6" towards the nearest fighter (whether they are visible or not). It must avoid impassable terrain but is otherwise unimpeded by terrain. It must stop its movement if it comes within 1" of another model.

#### Viscous Tongues

In each End phase, after moving, make a single attack against any models within 3" of it (measuring this distance from the plant’s branches), treated as a Flail with WS 3+:

- Strength 4, Damage 1, Entangle

Models attacked by Grapple Weed do not count as being Engaged by it.
