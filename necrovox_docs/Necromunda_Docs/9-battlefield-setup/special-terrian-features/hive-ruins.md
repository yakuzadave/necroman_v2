# Badzone: Hive Ruins

## Ancient Imperium

### Holy Imperialis

While within 6”, gain +2 modifier to any Willpower tests. However, fighters opposed to the Imperium, such as Chaos or Genestealer Cultists, gain -2 modifier instead.

### Mechanicus Arcana

At the end of a battle, if a gang has one or more fighters within 1”, and the opponent has none, gain D6x10 credits (in addition to any other scenario rewards).

### Ancient Terminal

A fighter within 1” may make an Access Terminal (Double) action (Intelligence test with a -2 modifier). If successful and a double, gain 2D6x10 Credits. In addition, if successful, roll a D6:

| D6  | Result          |
| :-: | :-------------- |
| 1-2 | +D6 Reputation. |
| 3-4 | +D6x10 Credits. |
| 5-6 | +D6 Experience. |

Once interacted with, it becomes inert and has no further effect.

## Avandoned Hardware

### Cranes and Servohaulers

Fighters in B2B can make a Jury Rig (Double) action. Pass an Intelligence test to move the terrain piece up to 10” (moving with it if they wish). Can't climb ladders, but can go up ramps or be driven off ledges (suffering and inflicting damage in the same way as falling fighters). Alternatively, the Hauler or Crane’s claw can be activated (if it has one) using the rules for Industrial Claws and Hooks (Industrial Terrain).

### Medicae Station

In the End phase, if Seriously Injured and within 3", instead of making a Recovery test as normal, make an Intelligence test. The result counts as a Recovery test roll.

- Pass: Flesh Wound.
- Fail: Out of Action.

### Vox Relay

If within 3”, the fighter can be included in a Group Activation regardless of range. This does not increase the number of fighters that may participate in the Group Activation, only the range.

### Force Barriers

Fighters hit by ranged attacks through a pair of pylons count as being equipped with a [refractor field](/docs/armoury/field-armour#refractor-field). If the refractor field burns out, the pylons cease working for the rest of the battle.

## Forgotten Ordnance

## Unexploded Ordnance

Should be limited to 0-2 pieces of terrain and placed within 12” of the centre of the battlefield.

In each End phase, place a token next to the unexploded ordnance. Starting from the 3rd round and onwards, roll a D6 after adding a token. If the result is less than the number of tokens, it explodes! All fighters within 6” suffers an Injury dice roll (armour rolls may not be made). In addition, all fighters on the battlefield must pass an Initiative test or become Pinned. Remove the Unexploded Ordnance from the battlefield.

Fighters within 3” can spend a Double action (Disarm):
Pass an Intelligence or Cool test to remove a token from the bomb.

### Fuel Drums and Ammo Crates

- EXPLOSIVE

If hit, make the following test:

- Str + D6 > 6

If passed, it explodes using a frag grenade:

- S3, Blast (3”), Knockback

It is then removed from the battlefield.

### Munitorum Containers

Treated as loot caskets that can't be moved and may be looted once each turn. Roll once for the content of the Loot Casket each time a Munitorum container is looted.

### Treasure Casket

Counts as a Loot Casket, with different contents. If opened, roll a D6:

| &nbsp;&nbsp;D6&nbsp;&nbsp; | Result                                                                                                                 |
| :------------------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|             1              | **Click!** - Fitted with a fiendishly clever needle-trap. Roll an Injury dice and apply the result (no save possible). |
|            2-3             | **Fancy Threads** - The fighter immediately gains Uphive Raiments Status item.                                         |
|            4-6             | **A Noble’s Ransom** - The fighter immediately gains A Personal Equipment item, chosen by the controlling player.      |
