# Special Terrain Features

## Declarations

When using special terrain, make sure to declare declare everything so all involved parts are clear on which rules apply.

## Activating/Deactivating Terrain

Some terrain have effects that can be activated/deactivated in 1 or 2 ways:

- **Random:** Activates on a 6+ in each End phase. The effects of the activation lasts until the next End phase.
- **Controlled:** If within 1” of a Terminal or Control Panel, a fighter can pass an Access Terminal (Basic) action (Intelligence test with a -2 modifier) to activate or deactivate one of the terrain piece’s effects.
  - **Activated:** Lasts until the End phase.
  - **Deactivated:** Remains deactivated until the next round’s End phase (all special effects are disabled).

:::info Access Terminal (Basic)

If within 1” of a terminal, make an Intelligence test with a -2 modifier.

If successful, activate or deactivate the special effect for a piece of terrain. Activation lasts until the End phase. Deactivation lasts until the next round’s End phase.

## Explosive Terrain

Some kinds of terrain are considered explosive and might explode if hit:
Targeted by an attack (melee/ranged): As if it was a fighter. Choose a point on the terrain as the target.
Stray shot: If a ranged attack misses against a fighter using this type of terrain as cover, roll to see if the terrain is hit by Stray Shots as if it was a fighter. The point hit will be the area of the terrain closest to the original target.
Explosive terrain can only explode once. Refer to the terrain’s special rules to see the effect of being hit.
