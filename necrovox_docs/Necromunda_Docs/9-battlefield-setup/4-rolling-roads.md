# Rolling Roads

_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_


Battles between gangs in the ash wastes are not static affairs. Bikes, trucks and
other vehicles careening across a desolate landscape, all the while trying to kill each
other, is one of the most evocative images of the ash wastes. These encounters are
represented with a set of rules called Rolling Roads.

If a scenario says it uses the rules for Rolling Roads then the following special
rules apply:

## The Battlefield

Rolling Roads battles take place across a rapidly moving landscape where each gang
has to struggle to keep up while still engaging the other.

### Battlefield Size

Due to the fast moving and expansive nature of a Rolling Roads battle, these rules
work best on larger battlefields than standard battles of Necromunda. An ideal size
is 6'x4', though different sizes and shapes also work and can lead to very exciting
battles! Many scenarios may suggest different sizes.

### Direction Of Travel

All Rolling Roads battles have a direction of travel. Sometimes this will be specified
in the scenario being used, but if not, randomly designate one of the short battlefield
edges as the Leading Edge and the opposite battlefield edge as the Trailing Edge. The other two battlefield edges are referred to as the sides.

The direction of travel is always from the Trailing Edge towards the Leading Edge.

### Battlefield Sides

Roads across the ash wastes take many different forms, from deep valleys, to wide
open ash flats, to precarious bridges going over deep crevasses. The following
are some example rules for how these affect the battlefield sides – scenarios will
introduce even more options:

**Impassable Sides:** No model may voluntarily move off the battlefield sides. If a
vehicle is forced to hit the sides, resolve it as if it were a [collision against impassable terrain](/docs/the-rules/vehicle-impacts#colliding-with-terrain).

**Cliff Sides:** If any model moves off the side, they are immediately taken Out of Action
or Wrecked as they plummet off the high road. Fighters immediately roll on the
Lasting Injury chart, vehicles on the Lasting Damage chart.

**Open Sides:** Models may move off via the sides. Treat them as Left Behind; they may
then try to Rejoin (see #2 below).

## Clouds Of Ash

As they race through the landscape, vehicles and fighters kick up huge clouds
of obscuring ash. If a model moves further than its Movement characteristic
during its activation, all shooting attacks against it suffer a -1 modifier until it is
activated again.

## The Rolling Roads Phase

At the end of each round, at the start of the End phase
the Rolling Roads phase happens. The Rolling Roads
phase is made up of the following steps:

1. **Move Battlefield:** The battlefield rolls on.
2. **Resolve Models Left Behind:** Any model that
   has been moved off the table attempts to rejoin
   the fight.
3. **Add New Terrain/Obstacles:** New terrain is added
   to the battlefield.

## 1. Move Battlefield

To represent the ever-moving nature of a Rolling Roads
battle, every round all models and terrain are moved
8" directly towards the Trailing Edge. If any model or
terrain contacts the Trailing Edge as part of this move,
it is removed.

## 2. Resolve Models Left Behind

Any models that are moved so that not all of their base
is on the battlefield are removed from the battlefield – they have been left behind in the maelstrom of
combat. What happens to them depends on their
Status when they were left behind:

- If they are a Prone and Seriously Injured fighter, roll
  to see if they succumb to their injuries. They then
  take no further part in the battle.
- If they are a Stationary and Stalled vehicle with a
  Movement characteristic of at least 7", they may
  not attempt to rejoin the fight this round, but may
  attempt to rejoin in future rounds.
- If their Movement characteristic is at least 7", they
  can attempt to rejoin the fight this round.
- All other models take no further part in the battle.

Any models that have fallen behind are counted as Out
of Action for the purpose of Bottle checks until they
manage to rejoin the battle.

**Rejoining the Battle:** Each model that has been left
behind and is eligible to attempt to rejoin the fight
makes an Intelligence test. If passed they become
Reinforcements, if failed they may attempt to rejoin
next round.

Each round, all available Reinforcements arrive for
all gangs. They normally only enter play within 3" of
the Trailing Edge, though if the scenario uses Open
Battlefield sides they can also rejoin the battle within
3" of a battlefield side. They enter play in the same
state as they left play; all Out of Ammo markers, Wounds, Flesh Wounds, damage, etc., still apply. The exception is Stationary and Stalled vehicles
change their Status to Mobile.

## 3. Add New Terrain/Obstacles

As gangs continue their battle down the Rolling Road, more of the road ahead comes into view. No-one
knows for sure what will be around the next bend so
they must be quick to react to the terrain that appears
from the ash clouds.

In order to represent the unpredictable nature of a
Rolling Road, first roll a D3-1 to see how many pieces
of terrain enter the battlefield. If the result is zero, no more terrain is added this round.

Otherwise, proceed as follows:

- Players alternate placing pieces of terrain, starting
  with the player who doesn’t have Priority.
- Any available and suitable terrain piece can
  be placed.
- If there is no Visibility limit then terrain must be
  placed touching the Leading Edge at least 3" away
  from any model or other piece of terrain.
- If there is a Visibility (X") rule then new terrain can be
  placed anywhere on the battlefield at least X" closer
  to the Leading Edge than any model – note that
  it still needs to be at least 3" away from any other
  terrain or models.
- If this isn’t possible, the terrain can instead be
  placed touching the Leading Edge at least 3" away
  from any models or other pieces of terrain.
- If terrain cannot be placed following these guidelines
  then no more terrain is generated.
