# Scenario Rules

_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

## Choose Crew

Each player chooses a starting crew for the scenario, using one of the following methods or a bespoke
method, as determined by the scenario:

### Random Selection (X)

When a scenario instructs players to use Random
Selection (X) to choose their starting crew, the following
method is used. When Random Selection (X) is in use, there will always be a number shown in brackets:

- The player makes a deck of their Fighter cards
  (if fighting an Ash Wastes battle also include any
  Vehicle cards). The deck may not include any models
  unable to take part in the battle.
- The deck may only contain one randomly selected
  card for any models who have multiple cards.
- This deck is then shuffled and a number of cards
  equal to the number shown in brackets is dealt out.
  This is the player’s starting crew.

### Including Vehicles In Crews

In general, vehicles should only be included in
battles taking place out in the ash wastes, though
if both players agree, they can be included in
Underhive battles as well – though it takes a
particularly foolhardy ganger to drive a vehicle
through the tunnels of the underhive!

:::

### Custom Selection (X)

When a scenario instructs players to use Custom
Selection (X) to choose their starting crew, the following
method is used:

- The player chooses their crew, selecting the Fighter
  cards and Vehicle cards of the models they wish to
  use, equal to the number shown in brackets.
- Where no number is shown in brackets, the entire
  gang may be used, should the player wish.
- If any models have multiple cards, the player
  chooses which equipment set the model will use for
  the battle.
- Models that are unable to take part in the battle may
  not be selected.

### Hybrid Selection (X+Y)

When a scenario instructs players to use Hybrid
Selection (X+Y) to choose their starting crew, the
following method is used. When Hybrid Selection (X+Y)
is in use, there will always be two numbers shown in
the brackets:

- The player chooses a number of models equal to the
  first number (X) to be part of their starting crew and
  sets their Fighter and Vehicle cards to one side.
  - If any models have multiple cards, the player
    chooses which equipment load-out the model will
    use for the battle.
  - Models that are unable to take part in the battle
    may not be selected.
- The player then makes a deck of any remaining
  Fighter and Vehicle cards.
  - If any models have multiple cards, randomly
    determine which card is added to the deck.
  - Models that are unable to take part in the battle
    may not be included in the deck.
- The deck is then shuffled and a number of cards
  equal to the second number (Y) shown in brackets
  are dealt out and added to their starting crew.

## Deployment

Many scenarios detail the size and location of
deployment zones. For those that do not, the standard
methods are as follows:

Draw a line dividing the battlefield into two equal
halves. Starting with the defender, or the winner of
a roll-off, players select one half of the battlefield in
which to set their crews up. The defender/winner of the
roll-off sets up first. All fighters in both players’ crews
must be set up at least 12" away from the dividing line.

## Gang Tactics

Gang tactics are selected for most scenarios –
presented here are the default rules for gang tactics.
If different rules are used for a scenario, this will be
stated in the individual scenario:

- Each player may choose two gang tactics from those
  available to their gang.
- If during the pre-battle sequence the total credits
  value of fighters in one player’s starting crew is
  less than their opponent’s then they may randomly
  determine an additional gang tactic for each full 100
  credits of difference.

:::info

### Which Gang Tactics Are Available To My Gang?

Guidance for how to work out which gang tactics
are available to your gang can be found in the
[Arbitrator Tools](/docs/category/arbitrator-tools).

:::

## Reinforcements

If a gang has Reinforcements available, the scenario
will describe how to create a Reinforcements deck
from the Fighter cards and Vehicle cards not in their
starting crew:

- Reinforcements always arrive at the end of the End
  phase. The scenario will state the round(s) on which
  Reinforcements arrive and how many arrive.
- Reinforcements are randomly drawn from the
  Reinforcements deck. For each model drawn, a D6 is
  rolled. On a 3+, the controlling player deploys them. On a 1-2, the enemy player deploys them.
- Unless instructed otherwise by the scenario, Reinforcements are deployed on any battlefield edge, and not within 6" of an enemy model.

## Home Turf Advantage

If a scenario indicates that one gang has the Home
Turf Advantage, they gain the following benefits:

- When making a Bottle check, roll two D6 and discard
  the highest.
- Models add 1 to the result of any Rally tests.

## Sneak Attacks

In some scenarios, the defender may not initially be
aware of the attacker’s presence. In these scenarios, the following rules are used:

### Sentries

Sentries are deployed as described in the scenario. Sentries never gain Ready markers before the alarm
is raised:

- When it is the defender’s turn to activate a model, they select a sentry (note that a sentry can be activated several times in the same turn) and make a Leadership test for them:
  - If the test is passed then the sentry activates.
  - If the test is failed then the attacker selects a
    sentry and that sentry is activated instead.
- When a sentry is activated, the defender may make a single Move (Simple) action with them. Sentries may open or close any door within 1" of them before or after making their Move action.
  - Once the attacker has activated their last model, the defender activates one more sentry and then the Activation phase ends.

### Spotting Attackers

After a sentry has moved, there is a chance they may
spot nearby attackers and raise the alarm. If there
is an enemy model either within 3" or in the sentry’s
vision arc, roll a D6 applying the following modifiers:

| Attacker state                   | Modifier |
| :------------------------------- | :------: |
| Attacker is within 3             |    +2    |
| Attacker is in the open          |    +1    |
| Attacker is in partial cover     |    -1    |
| Attacker is in full cover        |    -2    |
| Attacker is out of line of sight |    -3    |

If the result is a 4+ then the sentry has spotted the
attacker and may make a free Shoot (Basic) action
with them as the target. If a sentry is engaged by an
attacker, or hit by a shooting attack, they automatically
spot the attacker and may make reaction attacks
if engaged.

### Raising The Alarm

The alarm is raised if:

- A sentry has spotted an attacker.
- An attacker fires a ranged weapon without the
  Silent trait.
- An attacker fires a ranged weapon with the Silent
  trait and the defender rolls a 4+.
- A sentry is hit by a shooting attack.

The alarm is automatically raised at the start of the
End phase of the third round.

Once the alarm is raised, the Action phase immediately
ends, and any models with Ready markers lose them.
In the following rounds, defenders gain Ready markers
and activate normally.

## Pitch Black & Visibility

### Visibility (X")

Battles on Necromunda are not always fought in bright
light, either because of the smog of industry filling the
underhive, lumens failing due to lack of maintenance
or sporadic power outages. Out in the ash wastes
things are not much better, with the ever present ash
diffusing whatever light makes it past the roiling storm
clouds from Necromunda’s star.

These conditions are represented by the following
special rules:

- All models are subject to the Hidden condition
  unless they are using a photo-lumen, are subject
  to the Blaze condition, or become Revealed
  (as follows).
- Ranged attacks may not be made against targets
  more than X" away unless the target has replaced
  the Hidden condition with the Blaze condition or
  Revealed condition (as follows), or is using a photolumen. Fighters using photo-lumens, photo-goggles
  or infra-sights extend this range by 9" (note these
  and similar effects do not stack). In addition, models
  may not make a Charge (Double) action against
  enemies who they cannot see (for example, their
  target must be within X" or have a Blaze or Revealed
  marker on them or be wearing a refractor field).
- If any model subject to the Hidden condition makes
  a ranged attack (with the exception of weapons
  that have the Silent weapon trait), makes a close
  combat attack using a weapon with the Power
  trait, or is a vehicle that moves, remove the Hidden
  condition from them and replace it with the Revealed
  condition. In the End phase of each round, Revealed
  models become Hidden again unless they are also
  subject to the Blaze condition.

### Underhive Battles – Pitch Black

Underhive battlefields are almost always shrouded in
darkness. On a good cycle, the dome lumens might be
mostly lit up, casting weak light throughout the hive’s
tunnels and chambers; just as often, however, these
fail, plunging the entire area into darkness.

If both players wish to use the Pitch Black rules, roll
on the table below, after setting up the battlefield
but before choosing deployment areas or deploying
any fighters.

### Pitch Black Table

| D6  | Effect                                                       |
| :-: | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
|  1  | **Full Night Cycle:** The Visibility (3") rule is in effect. |
| 2-3 | **Near Night:** The Visibility (6") rule is in effect.       |
| 4-5 | **Near Day:** The Visibility (12") rule is in effect.        |
|  6  | **Full Day Cycle:** The Visibility (24") rule is in effect.  |

### Ash Wastes Battles

In the changeable conditions of the ash wastes, visibility is not always as good as in the underhive, protected as it is from the outside elements. The
Battlefield Conditions will often also dictate the use of
the Visibility (X") rule. In addition to the usual effects, the following rules apply while the Visibility (X") rule is
in effect for an Ash Wastes battle:

- All weapons use the Long Range accuracy modifiers, regardless of actual distance.
- When terrain comes into view during Rolling Roads
  scenarios, Visibility affects where it can be placed (see [Adding New Terrain](/docs/battlefield-setup/rolling-roads#3-add-new-terrainobstacles)).

## The Beast’s Lair

Dangerous creatures lurk in the underhive and out in the ash wastes, ready to prey
on careless gangers. If both players agree, the following special rules may be used to
represent the presence of such a creature:

After both gangs have been deployed, the defender or the winner of a roll-off
(if there is no defender) may deploy a Beast’s Lair (such as the one found in the
Necromunda: Hive War boxed set or something similar, modelled on a 32mm base)
anywhere on the battlefield that is not within 6" of any model.

If any model ends their activation within 6" of the Beast’s Lair, they risk rousing the
beast within. To see if the beast is roused, roll a D6. If the result is a 6, or if the
result is higher than the number of inches between the model making the test and
the Beast’s Lair, the model is immediately attacked by the beast. The beast has the
following profile:

<FighterCard>

</WeaponStats>

#### Special Rules

The Beast’s Lair is not a fighter. It is always considered to be Standing and can never become Prone or be moved by any means. Models can move within 1" of the Beast’s
Lair and may move into base-to-base contact with it without needing to perform a Charge (Double) action. Models can attack the Beast’s Lair with ranged or close combat attacks. If the Beast’s Lair is reduced to 0 Wounds, it is removed from play.

</FighterCard>

## Loot Caskets

There will always be at least two Loot Caskets placed on any battlefield, as described in[ Battlefield Set-up](/docs/battlefield-setup/battlefield-set-up), but many
scenarios include far more. Loot Caskets can contain
anything from food supplies to valuable munitions –
their exact contents will not be known until they are
opened. Standing and Active fighters within 1" of a Loot
Casket may perform actions to [open or carry a Loot Casket](/docs/the-rules/fighter-actions#smash-open-loot-casket-basic).

In addition, each Ash Wastes Hab always has a Loot
Casket inside.

### Opening Loot Caskets

If a Loot Casket is opened by a fighter, roll a D6 on the
table below to determine its contents:

| D6  | Result                                                                                                                                                       |
| :-: | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  1  | **Dangerous Goods:** The casket has been booby trapped. Replace it with a [frag trap](/docs/armoury/booby-traps#frag-trap).                                  |
| 2-3 | **Nothing Much:** The casket contains some sundry items of small value that someone will have a use for. Add D6 credits to the gang’s Stash.                 |
| 4-6 | **Ammo Cache:** The Loot Casket contains a number of commonly used ammo clips, weapon parts and loose munitions. Replace the Loot Casket with an Ammo Cache. |

### Ammo Cache

Before an Ammo test is made for any fighter within 1"
of an ammo cache, the controlling player can declare
that the fighter will ransack the ammo cache. Add 2
to the result of the Ammo test. Additionally, a fighter
with a weapon with the Scarce trait may ignore that
trait if they are within 1" of an ammo cache. However, should a natural 6 be rolled for an Ammo test while
ransacking the ammo cache, the ammo cache is
exhausted and removed from play.

## Booby Traps – Frag, Gas And Melta

A booby trap is represented by a marker placed upon
the battlefield at the start of the game, after the
battlefield has been set up but before deploying any
models. If both gangs possess and wish to use booby
traps, the defender or the winner of a roll-off (if there is
no defender) places theirs first.

If any model, friendly or enemy, comes within 2" of a
booby trap for any reason, they risk setting it off. Roll a
D6 on the table below to determine what happens:

| D6  | Result                                                                                     |
| :-: | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  1  | **Dud:** The booby trap is a dud, remove it from the battlefield.                          |
| 2-3 | **Lucky Escape:** The booby trap doesn’t go off… this time. Leave the booby trap in place. |
| 4-6 | **Kaboom!:** The booby trap is triggered and explodes.                                     |

The profiles for booby traps can be found in the [Armoury](/docs/armoury/booby-traps). The movement of a moving model is interrupted whilst
this roll is resolved. If the booby trap does not go off, their movement continues after the roll is made. If
the booby trap does go off, and a fighter is Prone and
Pinned or Prone and Seriously Injured, or a vehicle is
Wrecked as a result, their movement ends.

Any model can target a booby trap with ranged attacks. Doing so has a -1 modifier to the hit roll at Short
range, or a -2 modifier at Long range. If the booby
trap is hit, roll a D6 on the table below to determine
what happens:

| D6  | Result                                                                                                                |
| :-: | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1-2 | **Glancing Hit:** The booby trap is hit, but is unaffected by the impact.                                             |
| 3-4 | **Kaboom!:** The hit activates the firing mechanism, the booby trap is triggered and will explode.                    |
| 5-6 | **Fizzz…:** The hit breaks part of the firing mechanism, the booby trap is disarmed and removed from the battlefield. |

<!-- 
## Horrors in the Dark

When a fighter activates outside 8" of any other fighters (friend or foe), roll a D6:

| D6  | Result                                                                                                                                        |
| --- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Suffer a Strength 6 hit with AP -1 and Damage 2. If Seriously Injured, the fighter is dragged away into the darkness and taken Out of Action. |
| 2-3 | The fighter can't make any actions this turn.                                                                                                 |
| 4-5 | The fighter can only make one action this turn.                                                                                               |
| 6   | The fighter activates normally.                                                                                                               |

:::danger House Rule (Necrodamus, A&A)
Horrors in the Dark: Seriously Injured or Broken fighters should be ignored when measuring closest fighter.
:::

## Multi-player games

Many scenarios can be used with more than two gangs. They can be modified depending on the difference in Gang Rating:

- Stronger gangs can deploy in the most exposed area.
- Stronger gangs can deploy further away from the objective.
- Stronger gangs can have random crew while weaker gangs can have custom crew.

Multi-player games use all the normal rules for battles with the following clarifications:

#### Priority

Roll for Priority as normal, taking turns activating the fighters. Re-roll ties.

#### Melee Combat

Count interference from all fighters B2B, even if they are from different gangs. However, fighters can only claim assistance from models from their own gang.

#### Defenders and Attackers

In scenarios that have defenders and attackers, divide the gangs roughly equal on both sides.

- Passes an Initiative test. This test is automatically passed if at least one of the following is true:
  - The first time each round.
  - The activated fighter made an attack against the servitor.

If Engaged, make Reaction attacks as normal.

### Hive Dwellers

Treated as fighters and use the normal rules for movement, stray shots, being Engaged and pinning. However, if reduced to 0 wounds, they are taken Out of Action without rolling any Injury dice.

Hivers do not activate normally and instead react to the actions of nearby fighters. Hivers are triggered by the following actions:

- A fighter makes a Shoot action within 12”
- A fighter makes a Fight action within 6”
- A blast is placed (after scatter) within 6”
- A fighter or hiver is hit by a ranged attack within 6”

After working out the effects of the action that triggered the hiver, roll a D6 on the table that follows (roll separately for each hiver that is triggered).

| D6      | Result                                                                                                                                          |
| ------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1-2** | **Damn Gangers messing up my Town!** Take a single Shoot action using a stub gun at the nearest fighter (even if they didn’t trigger the local) |
| **3-4** | **OK, take it Easy Fella:** Take no action                                                                                                      |
| **5-6** | **I’m getting outta here!** Become Broken (may rally in the End phase as normal by passing a Cool test)                                         |

During the End phase, take turns moving the hivers. Roll the Scatter dice for each one - on a Hit, the player moves the hiver its full Move in a direction of their choice, otherwise they make a full Move in the direction indicated (stopping if it contacts terrain).
