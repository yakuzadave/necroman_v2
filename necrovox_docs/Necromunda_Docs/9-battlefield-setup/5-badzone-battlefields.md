# Badzone Battlefields

_Source: Book of Peril (2019)_

When using Badzone battlefields:

1. Select scenario
2. Roll for Environment
3. Roll for Event

## Badzone Environment

Environments last the whole battle. Planning or special considerations may be required when used in certain scenarios.

| D6  | Environment                                       |

|  6  | [Unstable Dome](#6-unstable-dome)                 |

## Badzone Events

Events last one or more rounds. At the start of the first round, randomize an Event and apply the effects for this round. In the End phase, roll a D6 to see if the Event is discarded. If it is discarded, generate a new Event, placing it immediately into play.

If using dice to generate Events and the same Event is generated twice in a row, the Event will instead be either a Shutdown (if the first dice of the D66 roll was an odd number) or a Hive Quake (if the first dice roll was an even number).

Events are automatically discarded after being in play for 3 full rounds.

When discarded, remove all related effects from the board, such as markers, terrain or creatures.

## List of Environments

### 1: Ancient Manufactorium

_A forest of rusting smoke stacks rises above a maze of ancient abandoned machinery, the rumble of dormant forges audible from somewhere far below._

The battlefield should include at least 6 pieces of Industrial Terrain.

For the duration of the battle, effects from Industrial Terrain will be triggered on a 4+ rather than a 6.

Roll twice and apply the highest result when rolling for rewards. If the scenario has no credit rewards then the victor gains D6x10 credits instead.

### 2: Stygian Depths (3D only)

_Cracks run through the very foundation of the hives creating vast yawning chasms between domes, the black criss-crossed with a web of rusting gantries._

The battlefield should include as many walkways and raised sections as possible, and allow for a path from one side of the battlefield to the other.

The ground level is an abyss and fighters must remain on the upper levels or if at ground level (i.e., level with the abyss) must remain on pieces of terrain.

When falling into the abyss, pass an Initiative test or go Out of Action. If passed, the fighter becomes a Reinforcement and may return to the battlefield in the following round.

### 3: Sump Sea (3D only)

_A bubbling morass of toxic goo, the sump boils up from below, flooding entire levels with an ocean of waste and forcing fighters to take to boats or bridges to cross it._

The battlefield should include as many walkways and raised sections as possible, and allow for a path from one side of the battlefield to the other.

The ground level is a Sump Sea and fighters must remain on the upper levels or, if at ground level (i.e., level with the sea), must remain on pieces of terrain. When falling into the Sump Sea:

- Take no damage.
- Placed where fallen.
- Can’t take any actions.

When activated, pass a Strength test or go Out of Action. If passed, swim up to the Movement. If reaching a ladder or terrain piece, the fighter may climb to safety. Place the fighter closest to where they swam.

### 4: Dome Jungle

_Local flora and fungi has claimed the dome for their own, the crumbling remains of habitation completely overgrown by twisting creepers and deadly Carnivorous Plants._

The battlefield should include at least 6 large areas of Carnivorous Plants terrain.

The Carnivorous Plants gain +1 S and +3” range. All wounded plants heal 1 Damage in the End phase. The thick foliage and drifting spores limit vision. Shooting attacks made at Long range suffer an additional -1 to hit modifier (in addition to any other modifiers).

### 5: Warp-tainted

_Something terrible happened here once and the veil between reality and the Warp has worn thin, its malign energies still bleeding into the hive from the beyond._

When failing a Willpower or Cool test, gain Insanity in addition to any other effects for failing the test.

When taken Out of Action in Close Combat (or Coup de Grace), make 2 Lasting Injury rolls and apply the highest result.

Gain +1 XP when taking an enemy fighter Out of Action with a Melee weapon (or Coup de Grace).

### 6: Unstable Dome

_An ancient war, forgotten quake or simply the march of centuries has rendered the dome unstable and ready to collapse given the slightest hint of violence._

When placing a Blast marker, before working out its effects, roll a D6. On a 5+, place another Blast marker of the same
size in contact with the first at a point determined by the Scatter dice. Work out the attack’s effects under both Blast
markers.

When going Prone on a raised platform or other piece of raised terrain, pass an Initiative or fall, as if within ½" of the edge.

Doors and other structures with Toughness and Wounds gain -2 T (minimum 1).

## List of Events

### Odd - Repeat Event: Shutdown (Discard On 4+)

_Perhaps triggered by the battle, ancient failsafes kick in and the entire dome goes into shutdown – doors lock tight, lights go out and all machinery grinds to a halt._

Apply the Pitch Black rules. All terrain pieces become inert and generate no additional effects beyond those laid out in the core rules (i.e., counting as impassible, blocking line of sight, being climbable, etc). All doors seal and can't be opened normally, but may still be forced.

### 11-12: Critter Swarm (Discard On 5+)

_A swarm of hive critters – rats, roaches, spiders or similar – burst from vents and grates, creating a crawling and biting carpet beneath the fighter’s feet._

In the End phase of each round, roll a D6 for all fighters. On the roll of a 1, pass a Strength test or become Prone. If already Prone while failing the Strength test, pass a save roll or suffer a Flesh Wound. If Seriously Injured while failing the save roll, go Out of Action.

**Dome Jungle:** Fighters are attacked on the roll of a 1 or 2.  
**Warp-tainted:** Fighters attacked by a Critter Swarm must also pass a Willpower test or gain Insanity.  
**Ancient Manufactorum:** When a piece of Industrial terrain activates (or is activated), all fighters within 1" are attacked.

### 13-14: Howling Winds (Discard On 5+)

_A huge ventilation fan hangs above the dome blasting its inhabitants with a storm gale, fighters battling the winds to keep their footing and find their targets._

Apply -1 hit modifier to Long range shots. Blasts always scatter. Gas and Smoke have no effect on 4+ (roll after firing but before working the effects). If failed, Smoke is simply removed. When going Prone within ½" of an edge, re-roll successful Initiative tests.

**Stygian Depths:** Apply -2 hit modifier to Long range shots. Gas or Smoke weapons have no effect on a 3+.  
**Dome Jungle:** Plants can make attacks from an additional 6" away rather than 3".  
**Unstable Dome:** Place 2 additional Blast markers when placing a Blast marker, rather than just one.

### 15-16: Choking Clouds (Discard On 5+)

_Ash from the wastes or toxic fog from hive bottom fill the battlefield, making visibility more difficult and covering fighters in a layer of grimy dust._

Apply -1 hit modifier to Short range shots and -2 to Long range. Blasts always scatter.
Stray Shots potentially hit fighters within 2" of the fire line rather than just 1".

**Stygian Depths:** Fighters on the highest level of terrain ignore the effects of the Choking Clouds unless they are
making attacks at targets on a lower level.  
**Sump Sea:** Fighters in the sea or level with it ignore the effects of the Choking Clouds unless attacking targets on a higher level.  
**Ancient Manufactorum:** When Industrial Terrain activates, until the end of the round, the area on it and within 3" of it ceases to be subject to the Choking Clouds effects.

### 21-22: Toxic Downpour (Discard On 3+)

_Foul liquid rains down from above, perhaps released from some waste facility or run-off from one of the water reclamation facilities filled with pollutants._

Toxic liquid rains down from overhead. Roll a D6:

| &nbsp;&nbsp;D6&nbsp;&nbsp; | Result                                                                                                  |
| :------------------------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|            1-2             | **Chem Rain:** -1 save modifier (Field Armours are not affected).                                       |
|            3-4             | **Irradiated Coolant:** -1T for Toughness tests or Wound rolls. Fighters become Revealed (Pitch Black). |
|            5-6             | **Waste Run-off:** +2 modifier when attempting to put out the flames (Blaze).                           |

**Warp-tainted:** +2 penalty to Willpower tests.  
**Sump Sea:** The sea rises when this Event comes into play. Remove any terrain level with the sea. Fighters who were on this terrain are now in the sea.  
**Dome Jungle:** In the End phase (before removing this Event), Carnivorous Plants heal all damage dealt to them.

### 23-24: Spore Clouds (Discard On 4+)

_Virulent spores fill the dome, drifting on the hive winds and making the air dangerous to breathe as they seek out new hosts for their parent plant._

After each fighter activation, roll a D6. On a 1, the fighter has attracted a swarm of spores. Roll a D6 and center the following grenade blast on the fighter:

| &nbsp;&nbsp;D6&nbsp;&nbsp; | Result         |
| :------------------------: | -------------- |
|            1-2             | Choke grenade. |
|            3-4             | Scare grenade. |
|            5-6             | Smoke grenade. |

**Dome Jungle:** +2” radius for spore blasts.  
**Ancient Manufactorum:** When Industrial Terrain activates or is activated, roll a D6. On a 1, all fighters on or within 1" of the terrain piece are affected by a random grenade effect.  
**Stygian Depths:** The grenade’s effects do not use blast (only affect the fighter who triggered the spores). Smoke use 3” blast, rather than 5".

### 25-26: Brainleaf Outbreak (Discard On 4+)

_The dome is home to Brainleaf growths, their questing fronds seeking out victims to dominate into doing their bidding._

When Seriously Injured fighters roll a Seriously Injured or Out of Action result in the Recovery phase become a Brainleaf Zombie. At the end of the battle, fighters who became Brainleaf Zombies automatically go into Recovery, but suffer no other effects.

#### Brainleaf Zombies

Suitable weapons:

- Clubs (or guns used as clubs)
- Unarmed attacks (fists and teeth)

| Profile          | M    | WS  | BS  | S   | T   | W   | I   | A   | Ld  | Cl  | Wil | Int |
| ---------------- | ---- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Brainleaf Zombie | 2D6” | 5+  | 6+  | 3   | 3   | 1   | 6+  | 1   | 12+ | 4+  | 6+  | 12+ |

**Special Rules:**

- Can't be Pinned.
- Automatically pass any Cool tests.
- Ignore all Injury dice results except Out of Action.
- Counts Out of Action as Seriously Injured.
- Recovers and stands up in the Recovery phase.
- Can activate normally with Blaze (still takes damage) and can't attempt to put out the fire.
- Only has a single action each activation.
- Move 2D6" when taking a Move action.
- If the movement take them into B2B with an enemy, consider this as a Charge and immediately attack.
- Enemies taken Out of Action are replaced with a Brainleaf Zombie in the End phase.

A player can activate a Brainleaf Zombie instead of a fighter from a gang (still moves 2D6” towards the nearest fighter).

**Dome Jungle:** Fighters taken Out of Action becomes a Brainleaf Zombie instead.  
**Unstable Dome:** Roll a D6 after using a blast weapon, but before removing the blast. On a 4+, the fighter who used the Blast weapon places D3 Brainleaf Zombies in contact with the Blast marker.  
**Ancient Manufactorum:** Hatches and vents might conceal Brainleaf Zombies. When emerging after using a hatch, vent or ductway, the fighter becomes a Brainleaf Zombie on a 5+.

### 31-32: Bad Air (Discard On 4+)

_The huge machines that regulate the hive’s air have failed in this region and the atmosphere is stale and thin, like a tomb sealed away from the world for centuries._

Double Move actions can't be made in an activation without a respirator. -1 S to Blaze weapons (minimum 1).
Fighters hit by weapons with the Blaze trait do not become subject to the Blaze condition.

**Stygian Depths:** Ignore Bad Air on level with the abyss or within ½" of an edge.  
**Dome Jungle:** The plants are less aggressive and only make attacks from 1" away.  
**Ancient Manufactorum:** When Industrial Terrain activates, the area on it and within 3" of it ceases to be subject to the Bad Air effects until the end of the round.

### 33-34: Sludge Jellies (Discard On 4+)

_Vile predatory sludges hide within the vents, drains and ducts of the battlefield, waiting to envelop and consume the unwary._

Any liquid terrain such as pools, puddles or toxic spills might hide a Sludge Jelly. Vents, ductways and hatches might also hide these horrors.

When ending a Move action within 1" of a piece of liquid terrain or using a ductway, vent or hatch, roll a D6. On a 1, the activation ends as the Sludge Jelly attacks (after using vent, ductways or hatch normally):
Pass a Toughness test or become paralysed and consumed by the Sludge Jelly. If another fighter does not assist them before the following End phase, the paralysed fighter goes Out of Action. If assisted, become Seriously Injured instead.

**Sump Sea:** There are Sludge Jellies in the sea and fighters who fall in it will be attacked automatically.  
**Dome Jungle:** Sludge Jellies may attack within 1” of Carnivorous Plants.  
**Warp-tainted:** If passing the Toughness test from a Sludge Jelly attack, pass a Willpower test or gain Insanity.

### 35-36: Giant Rats (Discard On 5+)

_A nest of giant Necromunda rats has claimed the dome as its own, and will viciously defend it against interlopers._

Place D3+3 Giant Rats (starting with the gang with Priority). These rats may be placed at least 1" away from another fighter and not within any deployment areas.

In the End phase (before testing to remove this Event), each Giant Rat will charge any fighter within 8", otherwise they will move 2D6" in a random direction, stopping if they come into contact with impassable terrain but otherwise moving up and down terrain without restriction. Once all the Giant Rats have been moved, add D3 Giant Rats (as above).

Apply a -3 modifier to the Intelligence test when directing Bomb Delivery Rats within 12” of a Giant Rat.

Exotic Beast must attempt to charge Giant Rats within 6" when the owner activates.

| Profile   | M   | WS  | BS  | S   | T   | W   | I   | A   | Ld  | Cl  | Wil | Int |
| --------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Giant Rat | 6”  | 4+  | -   | 3   | 3   | 1   | 3+  | 1   | 10+ | 8+  | 10+ | 9+  |

**Weapon:** Jaws (S3, D1, Melee, Backstab).  
**Stealthy:** -1 hit modifier when targeted by Ranged attacks.  
**Small Target:** Never a potential target when working out Stray Shot.  
**Nimble:** 4+ save (unmodifiable by AP).

**Unstable Dome:** Roll a D6 after using Blast weapons. On a 4+, place D3 Giant Rats in contact with the Blast.  
**Ancient Manufactorum:** When Industrial Terrain activates or is activated, place D3 Giant Rats in contact with the terrain piece.  
**Sump Sea:** When falling into the sea, place D3 Giant Rats in the sea at least 6" away. Giant Rats can move without restriction in the sea.

### 41-42: Lair Of The Beast (Discard On 5+)

_A massive hive beast lairs within this dome, slumbering beneath the battlefield, its tentacles questing in its sleep until it finds a prey worthy of its appetite._

After deployment, but before the first activation, add 3 Beast’s Lairs to the battlefield (starting with the gang with Priority). Must be placed at least 12" from each other or any model, and cannot be placed in any deployment area. If a gang destroys a Beast’s Lair, that gang can place a new one (as above).

**Ancient Manufactorum:** When Industrial Terrain activates or is activated, any of its hatches count as Beast’s Lair markers until the end of the round.  
**Stygian Depths:** Beast’s Lair markers can be placed in the abyss and will attack fighters who pass above them, counting as within 6” regardless of the actual distance (unless closer).  
**Unstable Dome:** After using a Blast weapon, roll a D6. On a 5+, place a Beast’s Lair marker centred on one of the Blast markers generated by the attack.

### 43-44: Things In The Dark (Discard On 5+)

_Darkness and shadows rule the underhive, though here they grow especially thick, and within their blackness foul creatures stalk, preying upon all who walk there._

Apply the [Horrors in the Dark](/docs/scenarios/horrors-of-the-underhive) rules.

-1 modifier to Long range shooting attacks (unless equipped with photo-goggles or a thermal sight).

**Dome Jungle:** Fighters will be attacked unless they are within 8" of 2 other fighters (rather than 1).

**Warp-tainted:** When rolling on the Horrors in the Dark table, roll 2xD6 and choose the lower result.

**Sump Sea:** Fighters in the sea must roll on the Horrors in the Dark table when they activate.

### 45-46: Gunk Tank (Discard On 3+)

_Sludge and waste spurt periodically into the dome, pumped down from uphive and potentially showering fighters in disgusting goo._

Before rolling for Priority, all fighters must roll 2+ or gain the Gunked condition:

- -1” M (minimum 1”).
- don’t add D3" when Charging.
- -1 modifier to Initiative.
- Blaze trigger on 2+.

**Ancient Manufactorum:** When Industrial Terrain activates or is activated, test against Gunked within 1”.  
**Sump Sea:** Automatically become Gunked when falling into the sea.  
**Unstable Dome:** Test against Gunked when hit by Blasts.

### 51-52: Labyrinth (Discard On 4+)

_At the best of times the underhive is a maze, though here it is especially tangled, and fighters might find themselves easily separated from their allies and all alone._

When activating without line of sight to any other fighter, pass an Intelligence test or become lost and are placed anywhere on the battlefield within 12" of their current position by their opponent. May not be placed in impassable terrain or within 1" of another fighter.

**Warp-tainted:** Fighters who become lost gain Insanity.  
**Dome Jungle:** Can be placed within 6” of a Carnivorous Plant if becoming lost within 6” of a Carnivorous plant.  
**Stygian Depths:** When falling into the abyss, become lost, rather than going Out of Action.

### 53-54: Old Cache (Discard On 3+)

_Forgotten militia armouries, abandoned settler storehouses and lost gang caches are hidden throughout the underhive for those with the wit to find them._

Fighters can spend a Double action (Scavenge) to search for loot. Roll a D6, adding 1 to the result for each other friendly fighter within 6". On a 6+, place a loot casket in base contact with the fighter.

For the duration of the battle, fighters may re-roll failed Ammo tests.

Grenades do not automatically run Out of Ammo for the rest of the battle if they fail an Ammo test, and may be reloaded in the same way as other weapons.

**Ancient Manufactorum:** Find loot caskets on a 4+ (rather than a 6+).  
**Warp-tainted:** If failing the Scavenge action, pass a Willpower test or gain Insanity.  
**Unstable Dome:** Grenades misfires if a Hit is rolled on the Scatter dice regardless of the result of the D6 roll.

### 55-56: Static Storm (Discard On 3+)

_Vast superconductors power entire levels of the hive, their constant motion periodically unleashing static storms into the underhive amid crackling blue lightning._

Energy weapons (plasma, melta, las weapons, etc.) gain Unstable. If the weapon already is Unstable, it automatically overloads if the Ammo symbol is rolled on the Firepower dice. When moving into B2B with another fighter, both fighters suffer a Strength 1 Damage 1 hit (resolved before completing any other actions, such as Charging). If using Pitch Black rules, become Revealed when moving.

**Ancient Manufactorum:** When Industrial Terrain activates, or is activated, all fighters within 1" suffer S 1 D1 hit.  
**Dome Jungle:** Carnivorous Plants inflict D3 Strength 1 Damage 1 hits in addition to any other effects.  
**Stygian Depths:** Apply D3 hits (rather than 1) when moving into B2B.

### 61-62: I’Ve Got A Bad Feeling About This… (Discard On 5+)

_The grind of machinery falls silent and even the local wildlife scuttle back into their holes, as if the underhive is holding its collective breath – waiting for something terrible to happen._

+2 penalty to any Nerve tests. Broken Hired Guns and Hangers-on are removed from the battlefield (count as Out of Action without Lasting Injury rolls).

**Warp-tainted:** Gain Insanity when failing any Nerve test (in addition to any other effects).  
**Dome Jungle:** Make a Nerve test if starting or ending an activation within 3” of a Carnivorous Plant.  
**Stygian Depths:** Whenever a Nerve test is failed within ½" of an edge, pass a Willpower test or jump into the abyss.

### 63-64: Witch’S Lair (Discard On 4+)

_A Wyrd has taken up residence in the area, and is none too pleased that fighters have disturbed their solitude, bringing both violence and the chance of discovery._

One random Standing fighter from each gang is attacked by the Wyrd in the End phase. Pass a Willpower test or immediately attack the nearest fighter. Randomize a Melee/ranged weapon to use.

**Warp-tainted:** Randomize 2 fighters to be attacked by the Wyrd rather than 1. Work out their attacks in the order they were chosen.  
**Sump Sea:** When attacked by the Wyrd, jump into the sea rather than make attacks. If the fighter can't jump into the sea, move as close to the sea as possible.  
**Stygian Depths:** When attacked by the Wyrd, jump into the abyss rather than make attacks. If the fighter can't jump into the abyss, move as close to the abyss as possible.

### 65-66: Mutie Tribe (Discard On 5+)

_A feral tribe of Muties has claimed this region as theirs and want to drive off the invaders, doubtless completely unaware of the vast world beyond their dome._

In each Priority phase, roll a 2+ for each fighter that is Active, or be attacked by Muties armed with mutie bows. The ranged attack hits on 6+ with S2 Ap +1 D1 (no cover benefits). When attacked by Muties, a fighter can sacrifice the Ready status for this round and roll the Firepower dice for one of their ranged weapons (possibly making an Ammo test) to repel this attack and any other for fighters within 6”.

**Dome Jungle:** Fighters are attacked on the roll of a 1 or 2.  
**Warp-tainted:** The first fighter selected is attacked by a Wyrd rather than a normal Mutie. Pass a Willpower to gain Insanity, or if failed, take a S5 D2 hit.  
**Ancient Manufactorum:** Mutie attacks are made with reclaimed autoguns rather than mutie bows.

### Even - Repeat Event: Dome Collapse (Discard Automatically)

_The mighty hive shifts on its foundations, domes crashing into each other, sludge seas draining, chasms closing or opening, and entire levels falling down into the regions below._

All fighters become Pinned (this may cause fighters within ½" of an edge to fall). Discard the current Environment and generate a new one. The effects of the new Environment come into play immediately.

Discard this Event Immediately.
