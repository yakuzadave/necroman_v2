    "description": "The first thing any aspiring gang leader needs is a
    gang of followers. Most gang leaders are experienced
    fighters, champions or heroes who have struck out
    on their own to further their legend and strengthen
    their position within their House. Accompanying these
    renowned fighters will be a core of close allies from
    their former gang, competent and seasoned fighters
    all. These fighters will form the core of the new gang, creating its hierarchy and leadership.
    
    To these dangerous individuals will flock aspiring
    gangers, the foot soldiers of their House. These
    fighters will be joined by green Juves and youthful
    Prospects. Juves are inexperienced rookies â€“ in the
    parlance of Necromunda, those individuals with little
    to no fighting experience hoping to be accepted into a
    gang and prove their worth. Prospects represent the
    young hopefuls of the House. Often, these fighters are
    the sons and daughters of past gangers. Such fighters
    bring with them great potential, and a great weight of
    responsibility to their forebears."
