# The Gang Roster

As well as filling in a Fighter card or Vehicle card for each fighter and vehicle in their gang, players will need to
complete a gang roster. This tracks additional information during Campaign play, such as Territories held, Gang
Rating, Reputation, Wealth and so on, as well as each model’s Experience and Advancements. During Skirmish
play, such information is of less importance, but a gang roster is still a useful tool.

## Completing A Gang Roster

The gang roster is made up of a number of elements, as
shown opposite. Many of these elements are explained
over the following pages. Those that are not are dealt
with in detail in the [campaign rules](/docs/category/the-dominion-campaign). These elements include the gang’s name (1) and Type (2), its Gang Rating (3), Reputation (4) and
Wealth (5), the Territories it holds (6) and its Stash (7), containing unspent credits, surplus equipment (both
weapons and Wargear), and so on.

The gang roster also has a line for each model in
the gang, with space for their names (8), fighter or
vehicle type (9), cost (10), Experience earned (11), the
number of Advancements gained (12), and whether
they are currently In Recovery or Repair (13) or have
suffered any Lasting Injuries, Lasting Damage or been
Captured (14).

Note that although the number of rows is limited, there
is no upper limit on the number of fighters or vehicles
a gang can contain. Should a gang be lucky enough to
have more fighters or vehicles than can be fitted onto
one gang roster, simply use a second gang roster for
extra space.

## Gang Attributes

In Campaign play, gangs have a number of attributes, which are tracked on their roster. These attributes, and
their starting values, are explained below:

### Gang Rating

The Gang Rating is an indicator of how powerful
the gang is – the proficiency of its models, how well
equipped it is, and so on. The Gang Rating is the total
cost of all of the fighters and vehicles in the gang,
including the cost of all the equipment and Upgrades
they are equipped with.

### Wealth

In Campaign play, gangs also have a Wealth value –
this is equal to the total cost of all of the fighters and
vehicles in the gang, plus the value of any credits or
equipment they have in their Stash.

### Reputation

Reputation is the measure of a gang’s standing and
power in their region of the underhive. It is separate
from Gang Rating, which is a measure of the gang’s
size and resources; a small gang can build up quite an
impressive reputation. A gang’s Reputation starts at 1, and cannot drop below 1.

## Model Campaign Attributes

In Campaign play, each model in a gang has a number
of attributes that are tracked in their entry on the
gang’s roster:

### Experience (Xp)

Models can spend Experience in order to purchase
Advancements – when they do so, their Experience
total is reduced accordingly.

### Advancements

The more Advancements a model has, the more
expensive any future Advancements will be. In the
case of models that start with an Advancement
(such as a free skill), this should be noted on the gang
roster, though in most cases this will not increase the
expense of future Advancements.

### Captured By, In Recovery & In Repair

When a fighter goes Out of Action during a battle
fought as part of a campaign, there is a chance that
they will suffer a [Lasting Injury](/docs/the-rules/resolve-hits#lasting-injuries). Many
of these will cause them to go Into Recovery and miss
the next battle. When this is the case, their In Recovery
box is ticked.

Similarly, during Campaign play fighters might be
[Captured by an enemy gang](/docs/the-rules/the-post-battle-sequence#being-captured) – while this
is the case, a note is made in the Lasting Injury/Captured
By box of the name of the gang that has Captured them.

Should a vehicle be Wrecked during a battle fought as
part of a campaign, there is a chance that it will suffer
[Lasting Damage](/docs/the-rules/resolve-hits-against-vehicles#lasting-damage). This may cause it to
go Into Repair and force both it and its crew to miss
the next battle. When this is the case, the vehicle’s
In Repair box is ticked.
