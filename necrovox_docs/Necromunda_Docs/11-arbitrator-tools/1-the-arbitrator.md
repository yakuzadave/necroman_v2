# The Arbitrator

_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

Running a campaign can be like telling a good story –
albeit one of desperate gang warfare, brutal underhive
societies and violent criminals. It is the Arbitrator’s
job to bring this tale to life, often playing the role
of the antagonists and the uncaring universe that
opposes the gangs in their rise to power. This can be
a demanding role – but also a very rewarding one –
and a well-arbitrated campaign will be one the players
remember for a long time to come.

In any campaign, the Arbitrator’s role is to keep track
of the action, make sure that the players are informed
as to the rise and fall of their opponents, and to decide
when the campaign has reached its conclusion. These
are the basic responsibilities of an Arbitrator, but if
they choose, there are many different ways for them
to shape the course of their campaign. As masters of
the campaign, they might choose to introduce random
sub-plots, tasks thrust upon gangs by their superiors
within the House structure that, should they complete
them, may prove valuable. Arbitrators can also create
their own battlefields for the players in their campaign
to battle over, rather than leaving players to set up their
own terrain. Battlefields can be built to reflect unique
locations, such as partially submerged domes, bustling
settlements or hive-fungi arboretums, pitting gangs
as much against the environment as each other. How
large a part the Arbitrator plays in their own campaign
is up to them, and some Arbitrators might like to
create complex story arcs with set events, while others
may choose to just add a few random events to spice
things up.

### Campaigns Without Arbitrators

Sometimes, there might only be a few players in
a campaign, or none of the players might want to
take on the role of the Arbitrator. In these cases,
it is still possible to play a Necromunda campaign, with each player taking care of their own pre- and
post-battle bookkeeping and the players keeping
track themselves of which territories they hold and
so forth.

To add some variety to these campaigns, the
players can use the House Sub-Plots and may
decide to use a narrative scenario rather than
rolling on the Scenario table as normal.
