# Optional Special Rules

_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

Below you will find a selection of optional rules that Arbitrators may wish to use in their campaigns. These can be used individually or several can be used together.

## Exploding Weapons

The majority of the weapons found in the underhive are
of relatively low quality, and very few indeed are well
maintained by their owners. It is hardly surprising that
malfunctions happen often. These rules make all weapons unreliable and
dangerous to use. If a natural 1 is rolled when making
an Ammo test, in addition to the fighter’s weapon being
Out of Ammo, the fighter must immediately roll a D6:

- On a 2+, nothing untoward happens.
- On a natural 1, the weapon explodes. When a
  weapon explodes it is destroyed, and is removed
  from the fighter’s card. In addition, the fighter
  immediately suffers a hit from the destroyed weapon.
  If a weapon has multiple profiles for different ammo
  types or firing modes, this hit is based upon the
  profile being used to fire the weapon.

## Unreliable Weapons

The Unreliable Weapons rule factors the chance of
running Out of Ammo into the hit roll itself, removing
the need to roll the Firepower dice unless the weapon
has the Rapid Fire trait. If this rule is in use in a
campaign, it should be applied to each and every
ranged weapon. At the Arbitrator’s discretion, Master- crafted weapons may be exempt from this rule, replacing the normal Master-crafted trait with the
ability to ignore this rule and roll the Firepower dice
when making the hit roll as normal.

When making a hit roll with a ranged weapon, only
roll the Firepower dice if the weapon has the Rapid
Fire Weapon Trait. When rolling the Firepower dice, the Ammo symbol is ignored. Instead, if a natural 6 is
rolled when making a hit roll with any ranged weapon, an Ammo test must be made immediately. If firing a
weapon that does not need to roll to hit (for example
a weapon with the Template trait), then after resolving
the weapon’s attack roll a D6. On a 6 an Ammo test
must be made immediately.

## Hail Of Bullets

The Hail of Bullets rule is designed to work in
conjunction with the Unreliable Weapons rule.

When making a hit roll for a weapon that has the Rapid
Fire trait, the player can choose to fire a single shot or
a sustained burst:

- If they choose a single shot, fire the weapon as
  normal, but do not roll the Firepower dice; the
  weapon will only fire once.
- If they choose to fire a sustained burst, roll a
  number of Firepower dice equal to the Rapid Fire
  trait of the weapon. Each bullet hole rolled on the
  dice is a separate shot, and a hit roll should be
  made for each.
- Shots can be distributed as described in the rules
  for distributing hits with Rapid Fire weapons – in this
  case, make a hit roll for each individually, working
  out modifiers for each target.

## Wild Grenades And Shells

The Wild Grenades and Shells optional rules make grenades and all Blast weapons less accurate, as well as more
dangerous to use.

When making a ranged attack with a weapon with the Blast (X) trait, choose a target point as normal but do not
make a hit roll. Instead, roll the Scatter dice and a D6:

- If a Hit is rolled on the Scatter dice, leave the Blast marker where it is and work out the effects of the attack as normal.
- If an arrow is rolled on the Scatter dice, move the Blast marker a number of inches in the direction indicated
  equal to the D6 result plus the fighter’s BS (i.e., a fighter with a BS of 4+ would add 4" to the scatter distance).
- If a Hit and a 1 on the D6 is rolled, something has gone wrong. Roll on the table below to determine what.

| D6  | Result                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| :-: | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  1  | The grenade goes off in the thrower’s hand or the shell explodes in the weapon’s breach. Place the Blast marker directly over the fighter and work out damage as normal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|  2  | The grenade throw goes wild or the shell spins out of control as it leaves the weapon. The projectile travels 2D6" in a random direction from the fighter and explodes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|  3  | The grenade travels 2D6" in a random direction from the fighter and explodes. A shell fired from a weapon travels D6xD6" in a random direction from the fighter and explodes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|  4  | Not only does the grenade throw go wild or the shell spin out of control as it leaves the weapon, but the projectile itself is faulty! The projectile travels 2D6" in a random direction from the fighter and lands. Mark the position of the projectile. From now on, at the start of each End phase, roll a D6. On a 4+, the projectile explodes.                                                                                                       |
|  5  | The grenade tumbles from the thrower’s hand down a deep crack in the ground, or the shell spins upwards and strikes the dome roof. There is a muffled explosion, the ground shakes ominously or chunks start to fall from the roof and tall ruins. From now on, at the start of each End phase, both players must roll a D6. If a player rolls a 1 then a randomly determined fighter from their crew has been hit by debris and takes a S3, AP-, D1 hit. |
|  6  | The grenade or shell drops to the floor in front of the fighter and fizzes ominously for a while, but little else happens. It is a dud.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

## Hive Dwellers

Many hivers react badly when strangers show up and start shooting, and it can be tricky to predict just how
they will react. Any number of Hive Dwellers may be introduced into a scenario and deployed by the Arbitrator
as they wish. They are controlled by the Arbitrator and are activated by the Arbitrator in the End phase and
use the following profile:

|  M  | WS  | BS  |  S  |  T  |  W  |  I  |  A  | Ld  | Cl  | Wil | Int |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 5"  | 5+  | 5+  |  3  |  3  |  1  | 4+  |  1  | 7+  | 8+  | 9+  | 9+  |

Hive Dwellers may be equipped as the Arbitrator wishes, but any weapons they carry should be low quality, cheap items. Autopistols, clubs, fighting knives and other such Common weapons are ideal.
