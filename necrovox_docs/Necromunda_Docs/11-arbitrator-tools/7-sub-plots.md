# House Sub-Plots

_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

The fortunes of a House are often tied invisibly to the
rise and fall of its strongest allied gangs – each gang
leader is akin to a general in the House’s armies, and
each victory earns the House masters much kudos
from their peers as well as political capital to further
their schemes. For the most part, the gangs are
given autonomy to further the interests of the House,
largely by the simple act of fighting in its name, and
sent to places where they can do the most good
(or harm to the House’s foes). Sometimes, however, the nobles of a house will choose to take a more direct
hand in matters – one which gang leaders ignore at
their peril.

House Sub-plots represent the more direct meddling
of the House in the activities of a gang. These side
missions can be included in any scenario, and allow
a gang to earn some extra Reputation, Credits, Experience or gain additional gang tactics should
they complete them. Players should decide during the
pre-battle sequence if they want to use House Subplots, with both players needing to agree to include
them. If they do, they will need a deck of playing cards
containing two Joker cards. Each player shuffles the
deck and draws a card without letting their opponent
see it – starting with the player with the lower Gang
Rating, or, if both gangs have the same Gang Rating, the player that rolls highest on a D6.

They should then consult the table in their respective
House of … book to see what kind of Sub-plot their
gang has been given. If a Joker card is drawn, the
player should immediately show it to their opponent
and draw two new cards (without showing their
opponent), giving them two Sub-plots for the battle.
If one of these cards is also a Joker card then repeat
the process, giving the player a total of three Subplots. Each Sub-plot contains details on when it is
revealed, how to complete it, and the rewards for
doing so. Unless otherwise noted, once a card has
been revealed, and its effects have been resolved,
it is discarded.

## Cawdor Sub-Plots

_Source: House of Faith_

House Cawdor gangs spread the faith of the Redemption with a fanatical devotion
that has seen the clan expand to almost every hive city on Necromunda. To be a
member of the Redemption means relentlessly pursuing the tenets of the faith –
bringing the down trodden and hopeless into the clan, but also exterminating the
mutant, heretic and unbeliever wherever they may be found.

If players are using sub-plots in their battles, then a Cawdor player may choose to use the Cawdor Sub-plots table rather than any of the ones in the rulebook. Unlike the Sub-plots in the rulebook, Cawdor Sub-plots do not use suits (i.e., any Ace drawn will represent the Test of Faith Sub-plot regardless of its suit).

|   Card    | Sub-Plot                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| :-------: | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  **Ace**  | **Test of Faith:** Reveal this Sub-plot if a Champion or Leader belonging to your gang is Seriously Injured or taken Out of Action by an enemy fighter. If, at the end of the Action phase, that enemy fighter is Seriously Injured or taken Out of Action, every fighter in your gang gains 1 XP. If the enemy fighter is not Seriously Injured or taken Out of Action by then, this card is discarded.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|   **2**   | **Fires of Redemption:** Reveal this Sub-plot if three or more enemy fighters are subject to the Blaze condition at the same time to immediately gain a single randomly selected Gang Tactic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|   **3**   | **Folly of the Faithless:** Reveal this Sub-plot at the start of the battle if the enemy’s starting crew contains one or more Psykers. For the duration of this battle, all Psykers in the enemy gang suffer a -1 modifier to their Willpower checks. In addition, for each enemy Psyker taken Out of Action during this battle, your gang gains D3 Reputation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|   **4**   | **Purge them All!:** Reveal this Sub-plot if at least three enemy fighters are Seriously Injured or taken Out of Action during a single round. Your gang immediately gains two randomly determined Gang Tactics. If the enemy fighters were Seriously Injured or taken Out of Action by weapons with the Blaze trait, your gang immediately gains three randomly determined Gang Tactics instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|   **5**   | **Hymn of Devotion:** If at the start of any of your activations two or more friendly House Cawdor fighters have made a successful Threshold test this round, reveal this Sub-plot. Every enemy fighter on the battlefield suffers a -1 modifier to any Cool checks they are required to make until the end of this round.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|   **6**   | **Martyrdom:** Reveal this Sub-plot during the Choose Crew step of the pre-battle sequence. Choose one of the fighters in your crew and tuck this card under their Fighter card or otherwise note that they are the subject of this Sub-plot. For the duration of this battle the chosen fighter counts as having no weapons, armour or Wargear regardless of what appears on their model. If the fighter manages to inflict a Serious Injury or an Out of Action result on an enemy fighter, they earn D3 XP. If, after achieving this feat, the fighter is then taken Out of Action, your gang earns +2D3 Reputation. |
|   **7**   | **Righteous are the Fallen:** Reveal this Sub-plot if you win the battle with three or fewer friendly fighters Standing and Active. If you do, your gang gains +D3 Reputation. If you won the battle with only a single friendly fighter Standing and Active, your gang gains +2D3 Reputation instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|   **8**   | **If It Doesn’t Hurt, It Doesn’t Count!:** Reveal this Sub-plot when a friendly House Cawdor Champion or Leader recovers from being Seriously Injured (i.e., rolling a Flesh Wound when making a Recovery test and becoming Prone and Pinned). Your gang gains +D3 Reputation. If the recovered fighter then goes on to recover from being Seriously Injured a second time before the end of the battle, your gang instead earns +2D3 Reputation.                                                                                                                                                                       |
|   **9**   | **March to the Grave:** Reveal this Sub-plot at the start of any round if your gang has failed a Bottle test and your opponent has at least three times as many fighters on the battlefield as you do. If you subsequently go on to win the battle, your gang gains +D3 Reputation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|  **10**   | **Rites of Doom:** If at the start of any of your activations two or more of your fighters are Engaged with the same enemy Leader or Champion, you may reveal this Sub-plot. If at the end of the activation that enemy Leader or Champion has been taken Out of Action, your gang gains D3+1 Reputation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Jack**  | **Word of the God-Emperor:** Reveal this Sub-plot when a Champion or Leader belonging to your gang uses the Group Activation (X) special rule. Until the start of their next activation, every fighter activated as part of that Group Activation gains a special 3+ save roll against any hits that cannot be modified in any way. In addition, until the start of their next activation, every fighter activated as part of that Group Activation that performs a Coup De Grace (Simple) action earns an additional 1 XP and your gang gains 1 Reputation.                                                            |
| **Queen** | **Reign of Madness:** Reveal this Sub-plot when an enemy fighter fails a Nerve test. For the remainder of this battle, an enemy fighter that fails a Nerve test does not become Broken. Instead, they become subject to the Insane condition.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **King**  | **Divine Possession:** Reveal this Sub-plot when a Champion or Leader belonging to your gang is taken Out of Action by an enemy fighter. The fighter is not taken Out of Action. Instead, they regain one lost Wound and, for the remainder of this battle, improve their Weapon Skill and Strength characteristics by 2 (to a maximum of 2+ and 6 respectively). However, if the fighter is taken Out of Action again during this battle, they are removed from play as normal, two Lasting Injury rolls are made against them and the higher result is applied.                                                       |

## Delaque Sub-Plots

_Source: House of Shadow_

House Delaque gangs excel at spying, sabotage and assassination and, as such,
their services are often employed by the Noble Houses or the Imperial House.
Whenever a Delaque gang enters battle, its true goal is seldom as simple as
defeating their rivals, rather, there might be numerous other subtle plans in play,
many unknown and unseen by the enemy.

If players are using Sub-plots in their games then a
Delaque player may choose to use the Delaque Sub-plots table rather than any of the
ones in the rulebook. Unlike the Sub-plots in the rulebook, Delaque Sub-plots do not
use suits (i.e., any Ace drawn will represent the Host of Shadows Sub-plot regardless
of its suit).

|   Card    | Sub-Plot                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| :-------: | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  **Ace**  | **Host of Shadows:** Reveal this Sub-plot at the beginning of a round if you have at least one fighter within 6" of each of the four corners of the battlefield and out of line of sight of any enemy fighters. If, at the end of the round, these fighters are still in place and not Seriously Injured, add D6x10 credits to your gang’s stash.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|   **2**   | **An Unkind Word:** Reveal this Sub-plot if a Champion or Leader belonging to your gang moves within 1" of an enemy Champion of Leader. Your Champion or Leader may then make the Clever Insult (Basic) action, forcing the enemy Champion or Leader to make an Intelligence check. If the test is failed, your Champion or Leader gains 1 XP. If the Intelligence test is passed, they earn D3 XP instead.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|   **3**   | **Five Small Secrets:** Reveal this Sub-plot when activating a fighter in your crew. That fighter may immediately make the Hide Device (Basic) action, placing a marker next to their location to indicate a hidden device. Place a token next to the fighter’s card or otherwise indicate that it is active on the fighter. If by the end of the game the fighter did not go Out of Action and placed at least five hidden devices, each at least 6" apart, then add 2D6x10 credits to your gang’s stash.                                                                                                |
|   **4**   | **Silent Footsteps:** Reveal this Sub-plot if one of your fighters engages an enemy fighter outside of their line of sight, and outside of the line of sight of any enemy fighters. If your fighter has not gone Out of Action by the end of round, immediately add a random gang tactic to your gang for this battle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|   **5**   | **Eyes in the Dark:** Reveal this Sub-plot if the Pitch Black rules are in effect or come into effect during the course of the battle. If your gang wins the scenario without any of its fighters ever gaining a revealed token (i.e., from firing a weapon, getting set on fire, or otherwise illuminating themselves), all fighters in your gang who took part in the scenario gain D3 XP in addition to any other scenario rewards.                                                                                                                                                                    |
|   **6**   | **Whispers and Lies:** Reveal this Sub-plot the first time one of your fighters takes the Coup de Grace action. Instead of sending the enemy fighter Out of Action they can instead make the Plant Lie (Simple) action. If, at the end of any round, there are three enemy fighters on the battlefield who have had this action made against them, your gang immediately gains a gang tactic for use later in this battle.                                                                                                                                                                                |
|   **7**   | **Craven is the Coward:** Reveal this Sub-plot if there are three or more enemy fighters currently Broken, and no friendly fighters within 6" of one of your fighters. If this is the case, add D6x10 credits to your gang’s stash. If all enemy fighters on the battlefield are Broken, add 3D6x10 credits instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|   **8**   | **Follow the Leader:** Secretly choose an enemy fighter at the start of the game – if the enemy Leader is on the battlefield you must choose them. Reveal this Sub-plot in the End phase if at least one of your fighters is within 6" and line of sight of the chosen fighter. If for three consecutive turns in each End phase you have a friendly fighter within 6" and line of sight of the chosen fighter, discard this card to add 2D6x10 credits to your gang’s stash.                                                                                                                             |
|   **9**   | **A Dark Mirror:** Reveal this Sub-plot after an enemy fighter completes their activation. One of your fighters within 18" and line of sight of the enemy fighter must then make exactly the same action(s) as the chosen fighter (i.e., move, shoot, charge, etc), though need not use the same weapons or select the same targets of their attacks. In each subsequent round, the fighter must activate after the enemy fighter and copy their actions. If they can do this for three consecutive rounds, they gain D3 XP. If they can keep it up until the end of the battle, they earn D6 XP instead. |
|  **10**   | **Dead of Night:** At the start of the game, secretly choose a number between 6 and 12. If, when the round number matches the number chosen, no enemy fighters have line of sight to any of your fighters, your gang immediately gains a gang tactic for use later in this battle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Jack**  | **No Witnesses:** Reveal this Sub-plot if one of your fighters takes an enemy fighter Out of Action while neither fighter is within line of sight of any other fighters. Place a marker where the enemy fighter went Out of Action (this marker can be moved just like a Loot casket as detailed in the Necromunda Rulebook). If, by the end of the game, no enemy fighters have come within 1" of the marker, add D6x10 credits to your gang’s stash.                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Queen** | **Hive Ghosts:** Reveal this Sub-plot if one of your fighters recovers from being Seriously Injured and goes on to take an enemy fighter Out of Action. If they do so, they earn D3 XP. If they do this and remain out of line of sight of any enemy fighters for the remainder of the game, they earn D6 XP instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **King**  | **Memory Fades to Myth:** Secretly choose one of your fighters at the beginning of the game. Each time an enemy or friendly fighter is Seriously Injured or taken Out of Action within line of sight of the fighter, make a note. If, at the end of the battle, the chosen fighter is still on the battlefield, reveal this Sub-plot. If they witnessed at least three fighters being Seriously Injured or taken Out of Action, add D6x10 credits to your gang’s stash. If they witnessed five or more fighters suffering these fates, add 3D6x10 credits to your gang’s stash instead.                   |

## Escher Sub-plots

_Source: House of Blades_

The fighters of House Escher revel in the surgically (and stylishly) applied shock and
awe of battle, dealing as much damage as they can in as short a time as possible
to demoralise and disorientate their enemies. They value skilful kills and daring
attacks, their fighters gaining great renown from their peers for impressive battlefield
feats. Escher fighters are also well known for their use of poisons and chems to take
down their foes, and the Clan Chymists regularly supply gangs with new experimental
toxins to try out in battle.

If players are using sub-plots in their battles then an
Escher player may choose to use the Escher Sub-plots table rather than any of the
ones in the rulebook. Unlike the sub-plots in the rulebook, Escher sub-plots do not
use suits (i.e., any Ace drawn will represent the Decapitation sub-plot regardless of
its suit).

|   Card    | Sub-Plot                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

Your gang immediately gains D3 Reputation. If the enemy Leader was taken Out of Action by your own Leader, your gang gains D6 Reputation instead.                                                                                                       |

|   **4**   | **A Dark Fate:** Reveal this sub-plot immediately during the post-battle sequence should your gang capture an enemy fighter. You may immediately roll on the Lasting Injury table for the captured fighter and apply the results.

|   **6**   | **Flawless Victory:** Reveal this sub-plot if, during the Wrap-up, none of your fighters are Seriously Injured or taken Out of Action, and if you have won the scenario. Your gang gains 3D6x10 credits.

|   **7**   | **Scrag ‘em All:** Reveal this sub-plot if the battle ended before round 9 and your gang was victorious. Your gang gains D3 Reputation. If the battle ended before round 6, and your gang was victorious, your gang gains D6 Reputation instead.                                                                                                                                                                 |

Your gang gains D6x10 credits. If the enemy fighter was a Champion or Leader then your gang gains 2D6x10 credits instead.                                                                                   |

|  **10**   | **Queen takes King:** If your gang Leader takes an enemy Leader, Champion or Bounty Hunter Out of Action, reveal this sub-plot. Your gang gains D6x10 credits. If they took the enemy Leader, Champion or Bounty Hunter Out of Action using a weapon with the Melee or Versatile trait, they gain 2D6x10 credits instead.                                                                                        |
| **Jack**  | **Bloody Sisterhood:** Reveal this sub-plot if, during any Recovery phase, two or more of your fighters recover from being Seriously Injured (i.e., they roll a Flesh Wound on the Recovery dice and become Prone and Pinned).

If any of the fighters taken out by a Coup de Grace (Simple) action were a Leader or Champion, you may generate two Gang Tactics instead. |

## Goliath Sub-plots

_Source: House of Chains_

House Goliath has its own way of doing things, which usually includes raw displays
of strength and dishing out excessive amounts of violence. Unlike other Clan
Houses, they care little for the nuances of inter-clan politics, or the whims of the
Great Houses. A Goliath gang that wins its wars through subterfuge is no Goliath
gang at all, and the demands of the Clan House reflect these savage beliefs. To this
end, House Goliath sub-plots are not so much cunning schemes or uphiver plans
as they are chances for Goliath gangs to prove just how tough they really are.

If players are using sub-plots in their games (see the Necromunda Rulebook) then
a Goliath player may choose to use the Goliath Sub-plots table rather than any of
the ones in the rulebook or elsewhere. Unlike the sub-plots in the rulebook, Goliath
sub-plots do not use suits (i.e., any Ace drawn will represent the King Hit sub-plot
regardless of its suit).

|   Card    | Sub-Plot                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

|  **Ace**  | **King Hit:** Reveal this card when one of your fighters takes an enemy fighter Out of Action with an unarmed attack (taking an enemy Out of Action with a Coup de Grace action does not count). The fighter immediately earns D3+1 XP. If they were Engaged with two or more enemies when this card was revealed, they earn D6+1 XP instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|   **2**   | **Raw Aggression:** Reveal this card at the end of the game, provided there is still at least one model from your gang on the battlefield. If all of your remaining fighters are in your opponent’s deployment area, your gang gains D3 Reputation. Additionally, if the battle ended without any of your fighters going Out of Action, earn 2D3 Reputation instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|   **3**   | **Stimmer Rampage:** Reveal this card after both crews have deployed but before the first round begins. Every fighter in your crew begins the game under the effects of a stimm-slug stash Unlike a normal stimm-slug stash these effects last until the end of the battle, or when the fighter suffers a Serious Injury. However, the rigours of such high doses of stimms mean that when rolling to see if a fighter is overcome by the effects of the chems, they must roll a number of D6 equal to the current round, with any results of 1 forcing them to suffer an Injury dice.<br /><br /> If you win the scenario, your gang earns D6 Reputation, in addition to any scenario rewards. If you lose, your gang’s Reputation is decreased by D3 instead. |
|   **4**   | **Paid Overkill:** If, at the start of any of your activations, two or more of your fighters are Engaged with the same enemy fighter, you may reveal this card. If at the end of the activation the enemy has been taken Out of Action, your gang gains D6x10 credits.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|   **5**   | **Pit Fight:** The first time one of your fighters uses a weapon that does not have the Melee trait, discard this card. If, at the end of the battle, your fighters only used weapons with the Melee trait, reveal this card. Every fighter in your gang gains D3 XP, in addition to any other XP awarded for the scenario.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|   **6**   | **Show of Brawn:** Reveal this card when a fighter in your crew uses a Brawn skill (i.e., Bull Charge, Bulging Biceps, Crushing Blow, Headbutt, Hurl, Iron Jaw), whether their action is successful or not. For passive skills, like Iron Jaw, this card can be revealed when the skill is triggered (i.e., when an opponent makes an unarmed attack against them). The fighter gains +1 XP. If the use of the skill took an enemy fighter Out of Action, they gain +D3 XP instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|   **7**   | **Excessive Force:** If one of your fighters inflicts 5 or more points of damage to an enemy fighter in a single activation, reveal this card. Your gang gains + 1 Reputation. If the attack resulted in the enemy fighter going Out of Action, your gang gains +2 Reputation instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|   **8**   | **Personal Vendetta:** Reveal this card should your gang’s Leader take your opponent’s Leader Out of Action with either a Shoot (Basic) action, or a Fight (Basic) action. Your gang immediately gains D3 randomly determined Gang Tactics.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|   **9**   | **Sky Stomp:** Should one of your fighters fall on an enemy fighter (see the Necromunda Rulebook), reveal this card. If the enemy fighter was Seriously Injured or taken Out of Action, your fighter gains +1 XP. In addition, if your fighter survived the fall (i.e., they were not Seriously Injured or went Out of Action themselves), they gain an additional +1 XP.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|  **10**   | **Impressive Combo:** Reveal this card if a Champion or Leader belonging to your gang wounds two or more enemy fighters during a single activation, using a weapon with the Melee trait. Your gang gains +1 Reputation. If three or more enemy fighters were wounded by the Champion or Leader using a weapon with the Melee trait, then your gang gains D3 Reputation instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Jack**  | **Contempt for the Weak:** Reveal this card during the Choose Crew step of the pre-battle sequence. You can reduce the size of your crew (as determined by the scenario) by up to half the number of models in your gang, to a minimum crew size of 1. If the scenario allows you to take your entire gang (i.e., Custom Selection without a number in brackets), then your entire gang is effectively your crew, and may be reduced as described above. Should your gang win the scenario, it receives D6x10 credits for each fighter that was removed from your starting crew.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Queen** | **Back from the Dead:** Reveal this card the second time one of your fighters recovers from being Seriously Injured (i.e., rolling a Flesh Wound when making a Recovery test and becoming Prone and Pinned). Your gang gains +D3 Reputation. If the recovered fighter then goes on to take an enemy fighter Out of Action before the end of the battle, your gang instead earns +2D3 Reputation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **King**  | **Naked Brutality:** Reveal this card during the Choose Crew step of the pre-battle sequence. Choose one of the fighters in your crew and tuck this card under their Fighter card or otherwise note that they are the subject of this sub-plot. For the duration of this battle the chosen fighter counts as having no weapons, armour or Wargear, regardless of what appears on their model. If the fighter manages to inflict a Serious Injury, or an Out of Action result, on an enemy fighter, and if they are still on the battlefield at the end of the game then they earn 6 XP.                                                                                                                                                                         |

## Orlock Sub-plots

_Source: House of Iron_

House Orlock gangs enforce the will of their House and ensure its mining operations
continue as they have always done. Sometimes, this means straight up killing rivals
in as efficient a way as possible, other times it means making an example of them.
Orlock gangs are also known for their hardiness, and many times a gang will do
something difficult or dangerous just to prove they can.

If players are using sub-plots in their battles (see the Necromunda Rulebook), then an
Orlock player may choose to use the Orlock Sub-plots table rather than any of the ones
in the rulebook. Unlike the sub-plots in the rulebook, Orlock sub-plots do not use suits
(i.e., any Ace drawn will represent the Hardman sub-plot regardless of its suit).

|   Card    | Sub-Plot                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| :-------: | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  **Ace**  | **Hardman:** Reveal this card when one of your fighters suffers two or more Flesh Wounds as part of a single damaging hit. If the fighter is still on the battlefield after working out the effects of the hit, your gang gains 1 Reputation. If the fighter is still Standing and Active, they gain D3 Reputation instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|   **2**   | **Sumptown Shakedown:** Reveal this card when a friendly fighter performs a Coup De Grace (Simple) action. Instead of rolling on the Lasting Injury table for the opponent’s fighter, instead count the result as Out Cold, and add D3x10 credits to your gang’s Stash. For the remainder of the battle, whenever a friendly fighter performs the Coup De Grace (Simple) action, the fighter taken Out of Action automatically counts the result on the Lasting Injury table as 12-26 Out Cold, and D3x10 credits are added to your gang’s Stash.      |
|   **3**   | **Prospecting Mission:** Reveal this card at the start of the battle, after both crews have deployed, but before rolling for Priority. Place three markers anywhere on the battlefield at least 12" from your deployment zone, and at least 8" from each other. During the battle, if one of your fighters is activated within 1" of one of these markers they may perform the Prospect (Basic) action, and remove the marker from the battlefield. At the end of the battle, add D6x10 credits to your gang’s Stash for each marker that was removed. |
|   **4**   | **Comeback King:** Reveal this card at the start of any round if your gang has failed a Bottle test and your opponent has at least three times as many fighters on the battlefield as you do. If you subsequently go on to win the battle, your gang gains D3 Reputation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|   **5**   | **Call them Out:** Reveal this card at the start of the battle, after both crews are set up but before rolling for Priority. Choose one of your fighters and one of your opponent’s fighters. If, during the course of the battle, your chosen fighter takes the chosen enemy fighter Out of Action from a distance of no more than 6", your gang gains D3 Reputation.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|   **6**   | **Take a Beating:** Reveal this card if you win the battle with three or fewer friendly fighters Standing and Active. If you do, add D6x10 credits to your gang’s Stash. If you won the battle with only a single friendly fighter Standing and Active, gain 2D6x10 credits instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|   **7**   | **Race the Clock:** If the battle ends before the start of round 7, and you are the winner of the scenario, reveal this card to gain 1 Reputation for your gang. If the battle ended before the start of round 3, and your gang was the winner of the scenario, gain D3 Reputation instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|   **8**   | **Outland Showdown:** Reveal this card at the start of any activation if a friendly fighter and one of your opponent’s fighters are within 12" of each other, but also both more than 12" from any other fighters. If this is the case, and your fighter can Seriously Injure the enemy fighter, or take them Out of Action, your gang gains 1 Reputation.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|   **9**   | **Hostile Negotiations:** When your opponent plays a gang tactic, if you have fewer fighters on the battlefield than your opponent does, reveal this card to immediately gain a single gang tactic. If they have three times as many, or more, fighters than you, gain two gang tactics instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|  **10**   | **Badzone Brotherhood:** Reveal this card if one of your Champions or your Leader use the Leading by Example special rule to allow three or more friendly fighters to automatically pass their Cool checks. The Champion or Leader immediately gains D3 XP. If the Champion or Leader used the Leading by Example special rule to allow all remaining members of the crew to automatically pass their Cool checks, they will gain D6 XP instead.                                                                                                       |
| **Jack**  | **Mano-a-Mano:** Reveal this card at the start of any activation while your Leader is Engaged with your opponent’s Leader. If your Leader takes your opponent’s Leader Out of Action with a Fight (Basic) action, add D6x10 credits to your gang’s Stash. If your Leader did so while Engaged with more than one enemy fighter, then add 2D6x10 credits to your Stash instead.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Queen** | **Ash Bath:** Reveal this card if three or more enemy fighters are subject to the Blaze condition at the same time to immediately gain a single gang tactic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **King**  | **The Last Round:** Reveal this card if one of your fighters successfully reloads one of their weapons and then takes an enemy fighter Out of Action with the same weapon as part of a single activation. That fighter gains D3 XP. If more than one enemy fighter was taken Out of Action during this single activation, the fighter gains D6 XP instead.                                                                                                                                                                                             |

## Van Saar Sub-plots

_Source: House of Artifice_

The gangs of House Van Saar operate to protect the interests of the House, ensuring its vast manufactoria
operations are protected from hostile rivals whilst simultaneously keeping the secrets of the House secure from
outsiders. To do this, Van Saar gangs rely on their technological superiority and the intellectual prowess of handpicked
gang leaders to present shows of unrivalled strength through superior tactics and firepower. Where other
gangs rely on brute force or dogged determination to win a fight, House Van Saar prefers to outwit and outgun
its foes.

If players are using Sub-plots in their games (see the Necromunda Rulebook), then a Van Saar player may choose
to use the Van Saar Sub-plots table rather than any of the ones in the rulebook. Unlike the Sub-plots in the
rulebook, Van Saar Sub-plots do not use suits (i.e., any Ace drawn will represent the Retaliatory Fire Sub-plot
regardless of its suit).

|  **Ace**  | **Retaliatory Fire:** Reveal this Sub-plot if a Champion or Leader belonging to your gang is Seriously Injured or taken Out of Action by an enemy fighter. If, at the end of the Action phase, that enemy fighter is Seriously Injured or taken Out of Action, every fighter in your gang gains 1 XP. If the enemy fighter is not Seriously Injured or taken Out of Action by then, this card is discarded.                                                                    |
|   **2**   | **Methodical:** Reveal this Sub-plot the first time a Seriously Injured enemy fighter is taken Out of Action by one of your fighters as a result of a Shoot (Basic) action. Your fighter immediately gains an additional 1 XP.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|   **3**   | **Shooting Gallery:** The first time one of your fighters becomes Engaged by an enemy fighter, discard this Sub-plot.

If you do so, your gang earns D3 Reputation, in addition to any scenario rewards.                                                                                                                                                                              |
|   **4**   | **Forward Thinking:** Reveal this Sub-plot when your opponent plays a gang tactic. If you have yet to play a gang tactic this battle, immediately gain one randomly determined gang tactic. If your opponent has played two or more gang tactics before this Sub-plot is revealed, and you have yet to play any gang tactics, immediately gain two randomly determined gang tactics instead.                                                                                   |
|   **5**   | **Radiation Purge:** Reveal this Sub-plot the first time an enemy fighter reduces their Toughness characteristic to 0 due to a 4+ being rolled as a result of the Rad-phage trait. Your gang gains D3 Reputation.

|   **6**   | **Seize the System:** If, at the start of any of your activations, two or more fighters have made a successful Intelligence check this round, for any reason, reveal this Sub-plot. You may immediately open, close and/or lock all doors on the battlefield, determining what happens to each door individually.                                                                                                                                                              |
|   **7**   | **Sucker Punch:** Reveal this Sub-plot if an enemy fighter becomes Seriously Injured or is taken Out of Action by a Reaction attack made by one of your fighters.

|   **8**   | **Well-prepared:** The first time one of your fighters fails an Ammo check, discard this Sub-plot. If, at the end of the battle, this card has not been discarded, your gang gains an additional D3 Reputation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|   **9**   | **Reliable Tech:** Reveal this Sub-plot during the Choose Crew steps of the pre-battle sequence. For the duration of the battle, only weapons with the Plentiful trait can be used; if a fighter that is part of your crew does not have such a weapon, they count as being equipped with a laspistol until the end of the battle, after which the laspistol is discarded. Should your gang win the scenario, it receives 2D6x10 credits, in addition to any scenario rewards. |
|  **10**   | **Shoot for the Head:** Reveal this Sub-plot if a fighter from your gang Seriously Injures or takes your opponent’s Leader Out of Action with a Shoot (Basic) action.

Your gang gains D6x10 credits, in addition to any scenario rewards.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Queen** | **Deadeye:** Reveal this Sub-plot the first time an enemy fighter is Seriously Injured or taken Out of Action as a result of an Improbable Shot (i.e., the shot hit after rolling a 6 for the Improbable Shot and then successfully Injured the target) made by one of your fighters. That fighter gains an additional D3 XP and your gang gains an additional D3 Reputation.                                                                                                  |

Your gang immediately gains one randomly determined Gang Tactic. If any of the fighters taken Out of Action in this way were a Leader or Champion, you gain two gang tactics instead.                                 |
