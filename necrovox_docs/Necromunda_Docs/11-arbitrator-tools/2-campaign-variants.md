# Campaign Variants

_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

Necromunda is an extremely customisable game system with a host of optional rules and expansions for the Arbitrator to add to their campaigns as desired. In addition to these campaign add-ons, the Necromunda campaigns themselves can be altered to give the Arbitrator and their players a different gaming experience. This can range from campaigns that place restrictions on weapons and wargear, victory conditions and Territory, all the way to those that change the way gangs are constructed or even the core rules of the game themselves.

Presented in this section is a collection of campaign variants designed to work with the standard Necromunda Dominion Campaign rules, though the Arbitrator can adapt these rules further to suit any campaign (though they may encounter some unusual situations during the campaign, and should be prepared to make some adjustments if required).

## Old Kingdoms

Some parts of the underhive have been under the
control of the same gangs since before anyone
alive can remember. Every now and then something
changes, a gang collapses or wants more, and then the
gangs go to war, re-soaking the same old ground with
fresh blood. In the Old Kingdoms variant, players each
start with two random Territories out of those drawn
for the campaign. The remainder are discarded. There
is no Occupation phase in this variant. Instead there
are two three-week Takeover phases, separated by one
week of Downtime.

## Into The Unknown

In this variant, the gangs are exploring an area where
everything is unknown – perhaps a pass into an
inaccessible part of the underhive has opened up, or
the gangs are prospecting deep in Hive Bottom or out
in the Ash Wastes. This variant works like the Dominion
Campaign, but rather than revealing the Territories at
the start of the campaign, they are kept secret (the
cards are drawn but not turned over). A Territory is still
chosen as the stake for each battle in the Occupation
phase, but that Territory is chosen from the unrevealed
Territories before being revealed. Simply, Territories
are only revealed to players when they are fought over.
In the Takeover phase, battles are fought over either
revealed Territories held by a gang, or over a Territory
that has not yet been revealed.

## Escalation Campaign

Sometimes on Necromunda, things get bad, and
then they just keep on getting worse. In an Escalation
Campaign gangs continue to increase in size and
power regardless of the outcome of the battles they
play. To defeat their opponents, players cannot simply
win their battles, but must utterly crush their enemies, or seek victory in other ways, as even a weakened
opponent will soon return to fighting strength.

An Escalation Campaign uses the following rules:

- In an Escalation Campaign, Territories and similar
  mechanics do not grant any credit rewards – though
  they may still provide other benefits (such as free
  Juves or increased Reputation).
- Gangs do not gain credits as rewards from scenarios, regardless of the outcome.
- Gangs cannot earn credits from selling equipment
  or fighters.
- After each battle a gang takes part in, add 250
  credits to its Stash. The most a gang can earn
  in this way during each Campaign Week is 500
  credits, though they may still earn extra Reputation, Experience and other rewards from fighting
  more battles.
- In an Escalation Campaign, Triumphs relating to the
  acquiring of credits and wealth are not used.

## Classic Campaign

A Classic Necromunda Campaign captures some of the low-tech simplicity and
savage randomness of the original Necromunda game. Gangs are less well-armed
and armoured, must rely upon chance to see what they find at the Trading Post
and must really smash their opponents if they hope to capture their turf. Classic
Campaigns also use some older game rules, making weapons less reliable, rapid fire
even deadlier and grenades more unpredictable!

A Classic Necromunda Campaign uses the following rules:

- When a player is creating their gang, they can only equip their fighters with
  Common items from the Trading Post, and any items that are unique to their
  gang’s House Equipment List. Flak armour and mesh armour are Rare (10). All fighters begin the campaign without armour, which does not alter their cost.
- Gangs cannot include any Hangers-on or Brutes or use gang tactics.
- All battles take place in the Underhive, this means vehicles and wargear that grant
  the Mounted condition are not used – note this means that gangs do not gain an
  extra 400 credits to spend on them.
- A gang can never contain more than two heavy and/or special weapons at any time. When the gang makes a Purchase Equipment action during the Visit the Trading
  Post step of the post-battle sequence, a player can buy Common items from the
  Trading Post, or items that are unique to their gang’s House Equipment List for
  their fighters.
- The Seek Rare Equipment action is changed as follows. The player rolls a D6 for
  each Leader or Champion that performed a Trade action during the post-battle
  actions step, and consults the table below to see what item is on offer:
  The player may then select one item in the category rolled regardless of Rarity (X)
  or Illegal (X) rules. This item may be purchased as normal.

  | &nbsp;D6&nbsp; | Rare Equipment                                                                                                                     |
  | :------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  |      1-2       | **Weapon:** Roll a D6 – 1-2 Basic Weapon, 3 Pistol, 4 Special Weapon, 5 Heavy Weapon, 6 Close Combat Weapon                        |
  |      3-4       | **Wargear:** Roll a D6 – 1 Grenades, 2 Gang Equipment, 3 Personal Equipment, 4 Weapon Accessories, 5 Status Items, 6 Exotic Beasts |
  |      5-6       | **Armour:** Roll a D6 – 1-5 Armour, 6 Field Armour                                                                                 |

- Each player begins the campaign with three Dominion Campaign Territories. These
  Territories are chosen by the player from all those available. There is no limit on
  how many players can choose the same type of Territory.
- During the pre-battle sequence, players ignore the Make a Challenge and Stake
  Territory step. Instead, players organise battles as they see fit.
- At the end of a battle, if the winning gang takes at least three times as many
  enemy fighters (minimum 3) Out of Action as the opposing gang did, then it takes
  over one randomly selected Territory from the opposing gang. If the opposing gang
  only has a single Territory, then no Territories are taken over.
- There are no Campaign Weeks, phases or Downtime in a Classic Necromunda
  Campaign – the Arbitrator and the players can decide how long they wish it to run.
- A Classic Necromunda Campaign uses the following optional rules: Unreliable
  Weapons, Hail of Bullets, Wild Grenades and Shells, and Exploding Weapons
  (see [Optional Special Rules](/docs/arbitrator-tools/optional-special-rules)).

## Ironman Campaign

In an Ironman Campaign, players create powerful gangs from all of the options
available to them. The catch is, once their gangs have been built, they must see if
they can go the distance, as they cannot replenish their losses with new fighters, buy
new equipment or fall back on allies or gang tactics for extra muscle. An Ironman
Campaign is also more lethal than a normal campaign, with death far more common, to reflect its added level of brutality. An Ironman Campaign uses the following rules:

- Each player has 3,000 credits to create their gang. When creating a gang, players
  can ignore the restrictions for including Hangers-on and Brutes based upon
  Reputation. Any unspent credits are added to the gang’s Stash, but can only be
  used to pay for visits to the Doc.
- During gang creation, fighters may be equipped with any item from their House
  Equipment List, the Trading Post regardless of the Rare (X) or Illegal (X) rules. Fighters can still only be equipped with items available to their fighter type
  (gangers cannot have special or heavy weapons, etc.).
- Dramatis Personae, Bounty Hunters and Hive Scum can all be added to a gang
  during its creation. For the purposes of this type of campaign, these fighters ignore
  the Dead, Not Alive, Claiming Bounties, and “We’ll Get Our Bit…” special rules and
  are instead permanently added to the gang.
- Leaders begin the campaign with 15 XP, Champions begin the campaign with
  10 XP, and each other fighter begins with 6 XP. Leaders and Champions can
  spend these XP right away or save them for later. Other fighters must spend themright away.
- Dominion Campaign Territories are determined as normal, then are divided up
  randomly between the players so that all Territories are claimed and all players
  have the same number of Territories.
- House Agents, House Favours and Alliances are not used.
- During the pre-battle sequence, the Recruit Hired Guns step is not used. During
  the post-battle sequence, the Collect Income and Visit the Trading Post steps are
  not used. In effect, players may never add new equipment or fighters to their gangs
  from any source (this includes fighters gained from Territories or gang tactics and
  equipment recovered from dead fighters).
- When a fighter (including Hired Guns) suffers a Lasting Injury, instead of rolling on
  the Lasting Injury table, the opposing player rolls a D6:

  | &nbsp;D6&nbsp; | Result                                                                                       |
  | :------------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  |      1-3       | Out Cold (see [Lasting Injuries](/docs/the-rules/resolve-hits#lasting-injury-table)).        |
  |      4-5       | Critical Injury (see [Lasting Injuries](/docs/the-rules/resolve-hits#lasting-injury-table)). |
  |       6        | Memorable Death (see [Lasting Injuries](/docs/the-rules/resolve-hits#lasting-injury-table)). |

- There are no Campaign Weeks, phases or Downtime in an Ironman Necromunda
  Campaign, and it continues until either there is only one gang left able to field
  fighters, or all but one of the players has retired their gang due to losses.

## Dome Rush

A hive quake has opened up a new area, and gangs
are rushing to be the first to claim the riches there.
In a Dome Rush Campaign, Territory is discovered and
discarded regularly, and the goal for the gangs is to
gain reputation and as many creds as they can muster, bleeding an area dry before moving on to the next.
It is a campaign that is rich in credits, and while gangs
don’t hold on to great territorial empires, they grow
rapidly in wealth.

A Dome Rush Campaign uses the following rules:

- Territory is handled differently in a Dome Rush
  Campaign – finds are quickly turned into credits
  and then gangs move on to fresh areas, travelling
  nomadically from camp to camp rather than
  establishing a hideout. Gangs do not start with any
  Territories.
- When a gang would claim a new Territory as a result
  of winning a battle, they instead add D6x50 credits
  to their stash, representing the finds in that region
  being quickly converted into credits.
- At the start of the first Campaign Week, the Arbitrator
  should generate a single random Territory – this
  represents the first area the gangs are exploring
  and it will remain in play for the duration of the first
  Campaign Week. For the first Campaign Week, all
  gangs gain the Boons associated with this Territory. This means they will earn credits from it, gain free
  fighters or enjoy any other Boons, just as if their gang
  was in control of the Territory.
- At the start of the second Campaign Week, the
  Arbitrator discards this Territory and generates a new
  Territory to take its place (representing a new area
  the gangs have moved on to).
- This process is repeated at the start of each
  Campaign Week for the duration of the campaign.
- In a Dome Rush, lots of good loot is flowing out of
  the newly discovered area – to reflect this, and to
  represent the eagerness of Guilders to capitalise on
  this new wealth, all gangs add 2 to the Availability
  Level when seeking Rare or Illegal equipment (see
  [Visiting the Trading Post](/docs/the-rules/the-post-battle-sequence#b-visit-the-trading-post)).
- Victory is determined by Reputation and credits. Triumphs relating to the gaining and holding of
  Territory are not used.

## Last Gang Standing

Trapped in a small settlement or cramped dome, a group of fledgling gangs wage a violent war for
supremacy. The Last Gang Standing Campaign is a
short campaign that is played out over a few bloody
battles. It is both quick and brutal, as all the gangs
are fighting over a single Territory or Racket, and every
battle results in casualties. This type of campaign
adds a number of additional rules that capture the
viciousness of this closed-in struggle for the control
of a small settlement or zone deep in the underhive.

A Last Gang Standing Campaign uses the
following rules:

- This campaign consists of only a single phase,
  itself lasting between three and six Campaign
  Weeks, as decided by the Arbitrator.
- At the start of the first Campaign Week, the Arbitrator
  should generate a single random Territory – this
  represents the extent of the small settlement the
  gangs are fighting over. All gangs gain the Boons
  associated with this Territory. This means they will
  earn credits from it, gain free fighters or enjoy any
  other Boons, just as if their gang was in control of
  the Territory.
- Gangs cannot recruit new fighters (other than
  those generated as Territory Boons), nor can they
  make use of Hired Guns, though they can still visit
  the Trading Post or Black Market and buy new
  equipment.
- Every battle in this campaign is a multi-player battle. Each time a battle is fought, the Arbitrator chooses
  the scenario and all gangs participate. Alliances
  between gangs are encouraged, but players should
  feel free to betray their alliances at the most
  opportune moments, representing the ruthlessness
  of the gangs in their drive for supremacy.
- When a fighter goes Out of Action, no roll on the
  Lasting Injury table is made – instead it is assumed
  that the fighter has been killed in the savage war
  for supremacy – and they are removed from the
  player’s gang.
- If a gang bottles out (including bottling out
  voluntarily), the Arbitrator removes D3 fighters
  at random from their gang, not including their
  Leader. This represents that the gang is new and
  inexperienced, and that green fighters may, when
  faced with the brutal reality of gang warfare, give it
  up as a bad idea.
- Victory goes to the gang with the highest Gang Rating
  at the end of the phase. No other Triumphs are used.

## Hive Empires

Having risen to control entire zones, mighty gangs then
turn their attention to each other, waging inter-House
warfare on an epic scale. In a Hive Empires Campaign, the gangs start out rich in Territories and Rackets, commanding a large section of the underhive. However, the size of their gang and their wealth is more tightly
tied to their holdings, and a loss to their ‘empire’ means a direct and lasting loss to their gang’s power. A Hive Empires Campaign uses the following rules:

- To play out the kind of macro warfare represented
  by a Hive Empires Campaign, the Arbitrator will
  need to create a map depicting the locations of the
  different gang holdings and the battlefields they are
  fighting over:
  - On the map, draw a number of zones – there
    should be three times as many as there are
    players in the campaign.
  - Then, draw lines linking each zone to one or more
    other zones (representing the tunnels and domes
    that connect the zones).
  - The Arbitrator can then give the zones appropriate
    names (such as the Cogwind Canyons, Sump-river
    City, or Ash Docks, for example).
  - The players begin the campaign in control of three
    connected zones (the Arbitrator can either assign
    these or have the players choose randomly).
- Each player has 3,000 credits to create their gang. When creating a gang, players can ignore the
  restrictions for including Hangers-on and Brutes
  based upon Reputation, allowing them to be hired at
  gang creation.
- At the start of the campaign, each gang has a
  Territory or Racket for each zone they control
  (the Arbitrator can assign these Territories or
  Rackets to zones or allow the players to do so).
- When issuing challenges, players can only attack
  zones that are connected to a zone they control –
  unless they make a deal with another player to pass
  through their zones.
- If the challenger successfully claims a Territory or
  Racket, they then take control of the zone and the
  Territory or Racket it contains.
- Victory is determined using all the normal Triumphs.

## Nomads Of The Underhive

In the deepest and darkest depths of the underhive
there are very few resources to go around, and gangs
must struggle over the scraps cast down from above. A Nomads of the Underhive Campaign is a campaign
that is very sparse in terms of credits and Territories, where the gangs must scratch out a living from among
the lowest levels of the underhive. It can present an
interesting challenge and change of pace from the
other, more cred-rich types of campaign available, as
gangs must truly struggle to survive.

A Nomads of the Underhive Campaign uses the
following rules:

- Each player has only 700 credits to create their
  starting gang, rather than the usual 1,000 credits.
  If fighting in the ash wastes, each player only adds
  300 credits to spend on vehicles and wargear that
  grant the Mounted condition instead of the usual
  400 credits.
- At the beginning of this type of campaign, the
  Arbitrator should generate as many Territories as
  there are gangs involved and randomly assign one
  Territory to each gang.
- Gangs cannot earn more than 100 credits in each
  Campaign Week, regardless of the source, though
  other rewards from scenarios and Territories can be
  gained as normal.
- The scarcity of goods in this type of campaign
  means that gangs are limited in the equipment
  they can have:
  - Gangs may not begin with any equipment that,
    in the Trading Post, has a Rare (X) or Illegal (X) trait
    with the value of X being greater than 10, even if
    included on their House list.
  - Gangs may not purchase during any post-battle
    sequence any equipment that, in the Trading Post,
    has a Rare (X) or Illegal (X) trait where X is greater
    than 10.
  - Gangs may purchase any other equipment from
    either their House or the Trading Post as normal.
- At the end of each Campaign Week, after gaining
  any Boons from them, each gang must discard all
  but one of its Territories. They may choose which
  Territories to discard.
- If a gang no longer controls any Territories, they remain in the campaign and may capture
  Territory as usual.
- Victory is determined by the last gang to hold
  a Territory.

## Helmawr’s War

Sometimes inter-House warfare becomes so
widespread that it disrupts hive production levels and
Lord Helmawr orders a gang purge. In a Helmawr’s
War Campaign, the gangs are divided into two sides
and war is declared! These divisions can be based
on almost anything, from outlaws versus lawmen to
heretics versus servants of the Ministorum, but only
one side can emerge victorious from the bloodshed.

A Helmawr’s War Campaign uses the following rules:

- At the start of the campaign, the Arbitrator should
  divide the players’ gangs evenly into those deputised
  by the Guilders and supporting the purge, and those
  declared as renegades and fighting against the purge.
- If there are an uneven number of players, then the
  odd gang joins the outlaws.
- Only outlaw gangs start controlling any Territory
  or Rackets:
  - Create a pool of Territories or Rackets equal
    to the number of outlaw gangs taking part in
    the campaign.
  - For the purposes of the campaign, all outlaw gangs
    benefit from these Territories or Rackets just as if
    their gang was in sole control of them.
- Deputised gangs begin the campaign with no
  Territories or Rackets, but may spend an additional
  250 credits when creating their gangs.
- As there are no unclaimed Territories or Rackets, gangs may challenge other gangs for Territories or
  Rackets from the beginning of the campaign.
- Whenever a deputised gang would gain a Territory or
  Racket from an outlaw gang, this Territory or Racket
  is discarded from the campaign, as it is considered
  to now be ‘under control’.
- There is no restriction on which gangs can fight each
  other (after all, it can be imagined that deputised
  gangs mistake each other for outlaws while outlaws
  are struggling over their shrinking turf). In these
  kinds of battles, no Territories or Rackets change
  hands, but gangs may earn credits, Experience and
  Reputation as normal.
- Victory is dependent on remaining Rackets or
  Territories. If all of these have been captured by
  the deputised gangs, then their side is victorious, otherwise the purge has failed and the outlaw gangs
  stand victorious. Other Triumphs may be used to
  determine secondary victory conditions as usual.

## Perpetual Campaigns

Sometimes you just don’t want the fighting to end as
gangs continue to grow ever larger and more powerful, or fall from seemingly unassailable heights to become
just another cautionary tale. The simplest method for
running a perpetual campaign is to just keep playing
battles. In this way the campaign has no end, and
the end of each campaign phase signals the start
of another. For those following a specific campaign
system with dedicated phases, such as the Dominion
Campaign, a perpetual campaign can be achieved
by looping the campaign phases – in this case, the
Occupation phase and Takeover phase – separated by
Downtime phases.

For example, a perpetual Dominion Campaign would
have the following sequence of phases: Occupation >
Downtime > Takeover > Cycle Downtime > Occupation > Downtime > Takeover, etc. Each complete block of
Occupation > Downtime > Takeover is referred to as a
campaign cycle, and each cycle is separated by a Cycle
Downtime phase. The Cycle Downtime phase is the
perfect time to introduce new gangs to the campaign, to form splinter gangs, or for a player to retire their
gang. Players wishing to carry on their gang unchanged
into the next campaign cycle do nothing and all rules
for a Downtime phase apply as normal to all gangs. This method can easily be used for other types of
campaign systems as presented here and in various
Necromunda supplements.

### Territories

When playing a Dominion Campaign, the end of a
campaign cycle will likely see multiple gangs in control
of several Territories each. In the case of a perpetual
campaign, players may find that all the Territories
available are soon controlled, making it difficult for newplayers to join in and make an impact.

To counter this, the Arbitrator may decide that
Territories must be refreshed during Cycle Downtime.
If Territories are refreshed, players retain a number of
Territories limited by their Gang Rating. Each player
may retain one Territory of their choice for each full
1,000 credits of their Gang Rating, e.g., a player
with a Gang Rating of 2,300 credits would choose
up to two Territories they currently control to retain. The rest of the Territories are lost and a new set of
Territories is determined as described in the campaign
being played.

When determining Territories for a new campaign cycle, the number of Territories generated should be based
upon the total number of gangs participating in the
campaign as normal. This means there will often be
more Territories to fight over in a perpetual campaign
than in a standard Dominion Campaign, and many
of these may be duplicated. This is deliberate. Not
only does it allow new gangs a fair chance to capture
uncontrolled Territories, it also means that, should a
veteran gang stumble and begin suffering losses, the
collapse of its large dominion both looks and feels
very significant.

### Semi-Perpetual Dominion Campaigns

A semi-perpetual campaign is a method based upon the idea of splinter gangs. After a campaign has ended, victors have been determined, Triumphs have been
awarded and things have settled down, players create new gangs as described
in [Gang Creation](/docs/founding-a-gang/gang-creation). Any player that was awarded a Triumph at the end of the previous
campaign and includes any fighters or Crew from their original gang receives
additional benefits based on the Triumphs they were awarded, as described in
the table below:

| Triumph     | Benefit                                                                                                                                                                            |
| :---------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Dominator   | The gang gains an extra starting Territory, chosen at random from all Territories after each player has chosen their starting Territory.                                           |
| Slaughterer | After the gang has been founded, the gang gains 6 additional XP that can be distributed between fighters recruited from an old gang. Only 2 XP can be given to any single fighter. |
| Creditor    | The gang starts with an extra 100 credits which are added to their starting Stash.                                                                                                 |
| Warmonger   | The gang starts the campaign with an additional 3 Reputation and can choose to be the attacker or defender in their first battle, regardless of who issued the challenge.          |
| Powerbroker | The gang can choose to start the campaign with one of the following Hangers-on for free: Ammo-jack, Dome Runner, Gang Look-out, Rogue Doc or Slopper.                              |

These Triumph benefits are only retained for that campaign. At the end of the
campaign, Triumphs are assigned as normal and can switch from player to player
between campaigns.

:::

### Maximum Starting Crewsizes

In a perpetual campaign, as gangs get larger the number of fighters will inevitably
increase and this could result in one gang fielding an unmanageable quantity
of fighters at once. To combat this, Arbitrators may wish to place a limit on the
maximum number of fighters a single player can field in scenarios with unlimited
Custom Crew selection.

A maximum fighter limit can be set through the use of a player’s Gang Rating. When
a scenario uses the Custom Selection method, a player can choose a maximum
number of fighters determined by their Gang Rating, as shown in the table below:

| Gang Rating | Maximum Crew Size |
| :---------: | :---------------: |
| Up to 1,000 |        10         |
| 1,001-2,000 |        15         |
| 2,001-3,000 |        20         |
|   3,001+    |        25         |

Hired Guns and fighters recruited as part of House Patronage are not included in this
limit and may increase the crew size above the maximum shown on the table
