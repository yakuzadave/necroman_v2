  BIOMANCER SPECIAL ABILITY

  If a Wyrd only selects powers from the Biomancy discipline, they gain the Fast Healing special rule:

  Fast Healing: When this fighter makes a Recovery test, roll an extra Injury dice then choose one to discard.

  QUICKENING (BASIC), CONTINUOUS EFFECT

  The wyrd pours psychic energy into their muscles, greatly increasing their reflexes.

  While this Wyrd Power is maintained,
  improve this fighterâ€™s Movement characteristic by 3 and their Weapon Skill, Ballistic
  Skill and Initiative characteristics by 1 (to a maximum of 2+).
