## Special Rules Quick Reference

### Gang Skills

|Skill Name|Skill Set|Skill Description|
|---|---|---|
|Evade|Cunning​|If an enemy targets this fighter with a ranged attack, and this fighter is Standing and Active and not in partial cover or full cover, there is an additional -1 modifier to the hit roll, or a -2 modifier if the attack is at Long range.|
|Fearsome|Ferocity​|If an enemy wishes to make a Charge (Double) action that would result in them making one or more close combat attacks against this fighter, they must make a Willpower test before moving. If the test is failed, they cannot move and their activation ends immediately.|
|Nerves Of Steel|Ferocity​|When the fighter is hit by a ranged attack, make a Cool test for them. If it is passed, they may choose not to become Prone and Pinned.|
|Unstoppable|Ferocity​|Before making a Recovery test for this fighter in the End phase, roll a D6. If the result is 4 or more, one Flesh Wound they have suffered previously is discarded. If they do not have any Flesh Wounds, and the result is a 4 or more, roll one additional dice for the Recovery test and choose one to discard.|

  

### Wyrd Powers

|Power Name|Discipline|Action Type|Power Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|Unbreakable Will|Telepathy|Basic, Continuous|Whenever a friendly fighter takes a Nerve test or makes a Willpower check whilst within 9" of this fighter, they may use this fighter’s Cool or Willpower characteristic instead of their own.|
|Zealot|Telepathy|Double, Continuous|Once per turn, when another fighter from the same gang that is within 9" of the Adept makes a Fight (Basic) or Charge (Double) action, any dice that roll a 1 to hit may be re-rolled.|

  

### Special Rules

|Special Rule|Description|
|---|---|
|Machine Madness|All attacks have Reckless. After a target is Seriously Injured or taken Out of Action, roll 2+ or immediately gain Insanity.|
|Valuable|(Ambot): If Captured and not rescued, it can be sold as normal or added to the gang for free (if having sufficient Reputation to take an extra Hanger-on). (Scrapcode-Corrupted Ambot): If Captured and not rescued, the capturing gang has the following options depending on alignment: Law Abiding: Sold as normal. Outlaw: Sold for full cost (Black Market). Added to the gang for free (if having sufficient Reputation to take an extra Hanger-on).|

  

### Weapon Traits

|Trait Name|Trait Description|
|---|---|
|Blast (x)|The weapon utilises a Blast marker.|
|Blaze|After an attack with the Blaze trait has been resolved, roll a D6 if the target was hit but not taken Out of Action or Wrecked. On a 4+, they become subject to the Blaze condition. Inorganic targets are not affected.|
|Concussion|Any fighter hit by a Concussion weapon will have their Initiative reduced by 2, to a minimum of 6+, until the end of the round. Any vehicle hit by a Concussion weapon will suffer a -2 penalty to all Handling tests until the end of the round.|
|Disarm|If the hit roll for an attack made with a Disarm weapon is a natural 6, the target cannot use any weapons when making Reaction attacks for the remainder of that round – they make unarmed attacks instead.|
|Graviton Pulse|Instead of rolling to wound normally with this weapon, any fighter caught in the Blast must instead roll equal to or under their Strength on a D6 (a roll of 6 always counts as a fail), or suffer Damage with no armour save allowed; any vehicle caught in the Blast must instead roll equal or over the Toughness value of the facing hit on a D6 (a roll of a 6 always counts as a success), or suffer a hit to the Body with no armour save allowed. After the weapon has been fired, leave the Blast marker in place. For the remainder of the round, any model moving through this area will use 2" of their Movement for every 1" they move (note this affects all vehicles regardless of their Locomotive special rule). Remove the Blast marker during the End phase.|
|Grenade|Despite being Wargear, grenades are treated as a special type of ranged weapon. A fighter equipped with grenades can throw one as a Shoot (Basic) action. Grenades do not have a Short range, and their Long range is determined by multiplying the fighter’s Strength by the amount shown. A fighter can only carry a limited number of grenades. The Firepower dice does not need to be rolled when attacking with a grenade. Instead, after the attack has been resolved, it is assumed that the Ammo symbol has been rolled and an Ammo test is made automatically. If this is failed, grenades cannot be reloaded; the fighter has run out of that type of grenade and cannot use them for the remainder of the battle.|
|Knockback|When a weapon with the Knockback trait hits a fighter, if the hit roll is equal to or higher than the target’s Strength, they are immediately moved 1" directly away from the attacking model. If the fighter cannot be moved the full 1" because of impassable terrain or another model, they move as far as possible and the attack’s Damage is increased by 1. If a Blast weapon has the Knockback trait, roll a D6 for each fighter that is hit. If the result is equal to or higher than their Strength, they are knocked back as described above – however, they are moved directly away from the centre of the Blast marker instead. If the centre of the Blast marker was over the centre of their base, roll a Scatter dice to determine which way they are moved. If a Melee weapon has the Knockback trait, the attacking fighter can choose to follow the target up, moving directly towards them after they have been knocked back to remain in base contact. If the attack was made across a barricade, the attacker cannot do this. If any part of the knocked back fighter’s base crosses the edge of a platform, make an Initiative test. If this is failed, they will fall. If this is passed, they stop moving at the edge of the platform.|
|Melee|This weapon can be used during close combat attacks.|
|Melta|If a Short range attack from a weapon with this Trait reduces a fighter to 0 wounds, no Injury dice are rolled – instead, any Injury dice that would be rolled cause an automatic Out of Action result. If a Short range attack from a weapon with this Trait wounds a vehicle, roll an additional Damage dice. If a weapon with this Trait has no Short range, then the Trait applies to all attacks made by it.|
|Parry|After an enemy makes close combat attacks against a fighter armed with a Parry weapon, the fighter can force the attacking player to re-roll one successful hit. If the fighter is armed with two Parry weapons, they can force the attacking player to re-roll two successful hits instead.|
|Plentiful|Ammunition for this weapon is incredibly common. When reloading it, no Ammo test is required – it is automatically reloaded.|
|Power|The weapon is surrounded by a crackling power field. Attacks made by Power weapons cannot be Parried except by other weapons with the Power trait. In addition, if the hit roll for a Power weapon is a natural 6, no save roll can be made against the attack (except Field armour save rolls) and its Damage is increased by 1.|
|Pulverise|After making an Injury roll for an attack made by this weapon, the attacking player can roll a D6. If the result is equal to or higher than the target’s Toughness, or is a natural 6, they can change one Injury dice froma Flesh Wound result to a Serious Injury result, or if targeting a vehicle roll an additional Damage dice.|
|Rapid Fire (x)|When firing with a Rapid Fire weapon, a successful hit roll scores a number of hits equal to the number of bullet holes on the Firepower dice. In addition, the controlling player can roll more than one Firepower dice, up to the number shown in brackets (for example, when firing a Rapid Fire (2) weapon, up to two Firepower dice can be rolled). Make an Ammo test for each Ammo symbol that is rolled. If any of them fail, the gun runs Out of Ammo. If two or more of them fail, the gun has jammed and cannot be used for the rest of the battle. If a Rapid Fire weapon scores more than one hit, the hits can be split between multiple targets. The first must be allocated to the original target, but the remainder can be allocated to other models within 3" of the first who are also within range and line of sight. These must not be any harder to hit than the original target – if a target in the open is hit, an obscured target cannot have hits allocated to it. Allocate all of the hits before making any wound rolls.|
|Rending|If the roll to wound with a Rending weapon is a 6, then the attack causes 1 extra point of Damage if the target is a fighter, or rolls an extra Damage dice if the target is a vehicle.|
|Scarce|Ammunition is hard to come by for Scarce weapons, and as such they cannot be reloaded – once they run Out of Ammo, they cannot be used again during the battle.|
|Scattershot|When a target is hit by a Scattershot attack, make D6 wound rolls instead of 1.|
|Sidearm|Weapons with this Trait can be used to make ranged attacks, and can also be used in close combat to make a single attack. Note that their Accuracy bonus only applies when making a ranged attack, not when used to make a close combat attack.|
|Silent|In scenarios that use the Sneak Attack special rules, there is no test to see whether the alarm is raised when this weapon is fired. Additionally, if using the Visibility (X") rules, a model using this weapon that is Hidden does not become Revealed.|
|Single Shot|This weapon can only be used once per battle. After use, it counts as having automatically failed an Ammo test. There is no need to roll the Firepower dice unless the weapon also has the Rapid Fire (X) trait.|
|Template|Template weapons use the Flame template to determine how many targets they hit.|
|Unwieldy|A Shoot action made with this weapon counts as a Double action as opposed to a Basic action. In addition, a fighter who uses a weapon with both the Unwieldy and Melee traits in close combat cannot use a second weapon at the same time – this one requires both hands to use.|
|Web|If the wound roll for a Web attack against a fighter is successful, no wound is inflicted, and no save roll or Injury roll is made. Instead, the target automatically becomes Webbed.|

  

### Wargear

|Wargear Name|Wargear Description|Additional Rules|
|---|---|---|
|Mono-sight|If a model attacks with this weapon after making an Aim action, add 2 to the result of the hit roll instead of 1.||
|Ablative Overlay|The first time a fighter wearing an ablative overlay is required to make a save, their save is 2 better than normal (i.e., a model with a 5+ save would gain a 3+ save). A model without a save gains a 5+ save. The second time they must make a save, it becomes 1 better than normal or 6+ if they did not already have a save. After the fighter has been hit twice, the ablative overlay is spent and has no further effect on the battle, but is retained by the fighter and may be used again in future battles.||
|Carapace Armor - Light|Light carapace armour grants a 4+ save roll.||
|Carapace Armor - Heavy|Heavy carapace armour grants a 4+ save roll. This is increased to 3+ against attacks originating within the fighter’s vision arc (the 90° arc to their front); check this before the fighter model is placed Prone and is Pinned. If it is not clear if the attacker is within the fighter’s front arc, use a Vision Arc template to check – if the centre of the attacker’s base is within the arc, use the 3+ save roll. Against attacks with the Blast trait, use the centre of the Blast marker in place of the attacker. If the fighter does not have a facing (for example, if they are prone), use the 4+ save roll. However, due to the extra weight of this armour, the fighter’s Initiative is reduced by -1 and their movement by 1" when making a Charge action.||
|Flak Armor|Flak armour grants a 6+ save roll. Against weapons that use a Blast marker or Flame template, this is increased to a 5+ save roll.||
|Mesh Armor|Mesh armour grants a 5+ save roll.||
|Armor Spikes|Inflict a S1 hit when becoming B2B with any other fighter (applied before any other attacks after this fighter or another fighter moves).||
|Bio-booster|The first time in each battle that an Injury roll is made for a fighter with a bio-booster, one less Injury dice is rolled. If only one dice was being rolled, two dice are rolled and the player controlling the fighter with the biobooster can discard one of them.||
|Cult Icon|When a fighter that is carrying a Cult Icon uses the Group Activation (X) special rule, they may activate one additional Ready friendly fighter, meaning that a fighter with the Group Activation (2) special rule may activate three additional fighters, whilst a fighter with the Group Activation (1) special rule may activate two additional fighters.||
|Grapnel Launcher|An Active fighter with a grapnel launcher can make the Grapnel (Double) action:<br><br>\|Grapnel\|Double\|<br>\|---\|---\|<br>\|The fighter can move up to 12" in a straight line, in any direction. This move can take them to a different level, as long as they do not move through any terrain.\|   \|||
|Medicae Kit|When a fighter with a medicae kit assists a friendly fighter’s Recovery test, roll an extra Injury dice then choose one to discard.||
|Photo-goggles|A model with photo-goggles can attack through smoke clouds, increases the value of X" in the Visibility (X") rule by 9" and may gain other benefits in low light conditions, depending upon the scenario. In addition, if they are hit by a Flash weapon, add 1 to the result of any test to see whether they become subject to the Blind condition.||
|Respirator|When a model with a respirator is hit by a weapon with the Gas trait, their Toughness is increased by 2 for the purposes of the roll to see whether they are affected.||

  

### Conditions

|Condition Name|Condition Description|Additional Rules|
|---|---|---|
|Blaze|Models with the Blaze condition can never become Hidden and cannot make Reaction attacks. There are additional effects depending on whether the model is a fighter or a vehicle.||
|Concussed (Fighter)|Initiative reduced by 2, to a minimum of 6+, until the end of the round.||
|Concussed (Vehicle)|Suffer a -2 penalty to all Handling tests until the end of the round.||
|Insane|When activating an Insane model, roll a D6. 1-2: The model immediately becomes Broken – or, if they were already Broken, they flee the battlefield. The opposing player can control the Insane model for the duration of this activation, treating them as part of their gang in all respects until their activation ends. As soon as their activation ends, the Insane model no longer counts as being a part of the opposing gang. 5-6: The model can act as normal for the duration of this activation. Once their activation is over, make a Willpower test for them. If it is passed, they lose their Insanity marker.||
|Webbed|While a fighter is Webbed, treat them as if they were Seriously Injured and roll for Recovery for them during the End phase. If a Flesh Wound result is rolled during Recovery, apply the result to the fighter as usual and remove the Webbed condition. If a Serious Injury result is rolled, the fighter remains Webbed, but they do not gain a Flesh Wound. If an Out of Action result is rolled, the fighter succumbs to the powerful sedative and is removed from play. Instead of rolling on the Lasting Injury table, roll a D6 to determine what happens to them – on a result of 1-4 suffer the 15-26 (Out Cold) result, on a 5-6 they suffer the 55-56 (Captured) result.||
