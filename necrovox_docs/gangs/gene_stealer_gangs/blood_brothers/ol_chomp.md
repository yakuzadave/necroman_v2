  Special Rules
  Many-shaped Horror: When a Sump Beast is recruited, the recruiting player chooses one of the profiles from those listed previously. In this way, the profile can be matched to the model being used to represent the creature, whether it is a lumbering brute, a rapidly moving predator, or a scuttling horror of many legs and eyes.

  Underhive Monster: When a Sump Beast is activated, if there is a Seriously Injured fighter within 6" (friend or foe) it must make an Intelligence test. If this test is failed, the Sump Beast must make a Charge (Double) action or a Coup de Grace (Simple) action against the Seriously Injured fighter.

  In addition, a Sump Beast must always make a Coup de Grace (Simple) action if able, rather than choosing to consolidate.

  Scaly Hide: A Sump Beast with this upgrade has a 4+ Save.

  Venomous Bite: The ferocious jaws of a Sump Beast with this upgrade gain the Toxin trait and change their Strength characteristic to ‘-’.

  Multiple Legs: The Movement characteristic of a Sump Beast with this upgrade is increased by 2" and it gains the Clamber skill.
