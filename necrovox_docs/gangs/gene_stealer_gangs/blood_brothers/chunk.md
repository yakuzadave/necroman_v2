  WALL OF FLAME (BASIC), CONTINUOUS EFFECT

  Fire erupts from the air to engulf an area of the battlefield.

  Place a 5" Blast marker so that its centre is anywhere that is both within 12" and line of sight of this fighter. Once placed, this marker does not move but will remain in place while this Wyrd Power is maintained. Any fighter
  that either begins or ends their activation touching the marker suffers a Strength 3,
  Damage 1, AP 1 hit as if from a weapon with the Blaze trait.
