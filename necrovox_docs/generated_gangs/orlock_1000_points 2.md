# Gang Goals
Let's get back to the battle at hand.

As you decide to launch a counter-attack against the Goliath forces, I roll a dice for you: `dice: 1d6`

The result is... **4**!

With this roll, your gang gains an initial advantage in the counter-attack. Your fighters, Grimjack "The Unyielding" and Kaelin "The Butcher", move forward aggressively, taking cover behind nearby crates and debris.

Grimjack takes aim with his trusty Autopistol, firing a few shots at the Goliath forces to try and pin them down. Meanwhile, Kaelin readies her Chainsword, preparing to charge into melee combat if needed.

The enemy gang, however, is not easily intimidated. Grimgold Ironfist, their leader, rallies his retinue and begins to push back against your gang's counter-attack.

As the leader of this Orlock gang, you have several goals that drive your actions:

**Primary Goal:** Secure control of Sector 4's mineral deposits for House Orlock. These valuable resources will help fuel your gang's growth and expansion in the underhive.

**Secondary Goals:**

1. Eliminate Grimgold Ironfist, leader of the Goliath forces, to weaken their resistance and clear the way for your gang's expansion.
2. Capture key strategic locations within Sector 4, such as abandoned factories or fortified strongpoints, to establish a foothold and deter rival gangs.

What would you like to do next?

B) Try to outmaneuver the enemy gang and flank them
C) Focus on securing key defensive positions and preparing for the next wave of attackers

# Gang Stronghold
Let's get back to the battle at hand.

**Gang Stronghold:**

The House of Orlock's stronghold is the imposing fortress-city of Hive Primus, a testament to their unyielding spirit and unwavering dedication to the underhive. This ancient structure has been the seat of Orlock power for generations, its labyrinthine tunnels and chambers home to countless secrets and mysteries.

**Gang Description:**

The House of Orlock is a noble and proud clan of miners and warriors who have long dominated the underhive. With their stronghold in Hive Primus, they control the flow of precious minerals and resources, using their wealth and influence to shape the fate of the hive. The Orlocks are known for their unwavering loyalty, unshakeable resolve, and unmatched ferocity in combat.

**Current Situation:**

You're currently in the midst of a fierce battle against the House of Goliath, who are seeking to claim control of the valuable mineral deposits in Sector 4. Your gang has managed to hold off the initial assault, but you know that reinforcements will be arriving soon.

As the leader of an Orlock gang, I decide to:

A) Launch a counter-attack against the Goliath forces
I want to take the initiative and push back against Grimgold Ironfist and his gang. With my two fighters, Grimjack "The Unyielding" and Kaelin "The Butcher", we can try to outmaneuver the enemy and gain an advantage.

Please roll a dice for me: `dice: 1d6`

(The result is... **4**!)


# Gang Description
Let me expand on the description for your Orlock gang:

**Leader (You):**
As the leader of an Orlock gang, you're a natural-born fighter with a reputation for being fearless and unyielding. Your name is whispered in awe by the miners and workers in Hive Primus, who know that when you lead a charge into battle, victory is all but certain.

**Grimjack "The Unyielding":**
Your first fighter, Grimjack, is a grizzled veteran of the underhive's darkest corners. He's fought countless battles against rival gangs, mutants, and even the occasional lost explorer who wandered too far from the safety of Hive Primus. His Autopistol is his trusty sidearm, and he knows how to use it to devastating effect.

**Kaelin "The Butcher":**
Your second fighter, Kaelin, is a butcher-turned-fighter who's traded in her cleaver for a Chainsword. She's as ruthless on the battlefield as she was in the slaughterhouse, cutting down enemies with precision and efficiency. Her reputation precedes her, striking fear into the hearts of those who dare oppose her.

**Elara "The Healer":**
Your Medik, Elara, is a skilled nurse and medic who's seen her share of battles. She's as comfortable patching up wounded gangers as she is reviving them with adrenaline shots. Her medical bag is filled with all manner of bandages, stim-packs, and other wargear that can turn the tide of battle in your favor.

Now that we have a better understanding of your Orlock gang, what would you like to do next?

A) Continue the counter-attack with Grimjack and Kaelin
B) Try to outmaneuver the enemy gang and flank them
C) Focus on securing key defensive positions and preparing for the next wave of attackers
