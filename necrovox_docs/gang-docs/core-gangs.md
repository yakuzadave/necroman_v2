# Gangs

The first thing any aspiring gang leader needs is a
gang of followers. Most gang leaders are experienced
fighters, champions or heroes who have struck out
on their own to further their legend and strengthen
their position within their House. Accompanying these
renowned fighters will be a core of close allies from
their former gang, competent and seasoned fighters
all. These fighters will form the core of the new gang, creating its hierarchy and leadership.

To these dangerous individuals will flock aspiring
gangers, the foot soldiers of their House. These
fighters will be joined by green Juves and youthful
Prospects. Juves are inexperienced rookies â€“ in the
parlance of Necromunda, those individuals with little
to no fighting experience hoping to be accepted into a
gang and prove their worth. Prospects represent the
young hopefuls of the House. Often, these fighters are
the sons and daughters of past gangers. Such fighters
bring with them great potential, and a great weight of
responsibility to their forebears.
