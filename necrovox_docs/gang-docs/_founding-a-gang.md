# Founding a Gang

Each gang has a starting budget:

- Normal: 1000 credits
- With vehicles: 1400 credits. The +400 extra credits can only be spent on vehicles, Mounted fighters and Wargear granting Mounted condition.

The budget can be spent on fighters and equipment. Any credits not spent are added to the gang’s Stash and stored away for later use. A gang does not have an upper limit on the number of fighters it can contain.

## Gang Composition

All gangs follow these rules when founded and when new fighters are added to the gang:

- Always 1 Leader (if killed or captured and sold to the Guilders, see [Loss of a Leader](core-gang-creation.md#loss-of-a-leader)).
- At least half the gang must consist of Gang Fighters (not counting [Hangers-on](/docs/gangs/gang-additions/hangers-on) or [Hired Guns](/docs/gangs/gang-additions/hired-guns/)). Gang Fighters are any of the following:
  - Ganger & Ganger (Specialist)
  - Juve & Juve (Specialist)
  - Crew

### Gang Fighter Balance

If at any time more than half of the gang’s fighters are not Gang Fighter, the gang must take actions to restore the balance:

- Retire fighters without the Gang Fighter ability.
- Recruit fighters with the Gang Fighter ability.

Continue to take these actions until balance is restored (at least half the gang consists of Gang Fighters).

All gangs can purchase new weapons and equipment from the Equipment List, Trading Post or Black Market. However, some fighter types can't take weapons or can only take weapons from the Equipment List.

:::danger House Rule (A&A)

- A gang can only have up to 1 Specialist Champion at a time
- A gang can only have up to 1 Brute at a time

:::

### Weapons & Wargear (Equipment, Armour, Grenades)

- A fighter can be equipped with a max of 3 weapons (slots), unless noted otherwise.
- Weapons marked with \* take up 2 weapon slots.
- Any fighter can be equipped with unlimited Wargear (Equipment, Armour and Grenades), unless specifically stated otherwise.

:::danger House Rule (A&A)

- Equipment can be swapped between fighters who are not in recovery.
- Limit of 1 Limited ammo per weapon.

:::

### Faction Fighter

The following are considered a Faction fighter:

- Leader, Champion, Ganger, Juve (including any Specialist variants).
- Hangers-on (including Brutes).
- Hired Guns with a gang specific discount or availability.

Any other fighters like pets/exotic beasts or universally available Hired Guns are not considered a Faction Fighter. Each Alliance is their own separate Faction.

:::danger House Rule (Necrodamus)

The official rules often mention <Gang\> Fighter, but this is never defined. The Faction Fighter rule is a suggested definition, based on some official wordings including "Agents, Hangers-on and Brutes".

### Equipment

- New (purchased or from Stash): Any fighter can gain new equipment during the campaign.
- Discard (return to Stash):
  - Wargear: Any fighter can discard a piece of Wargear if it is replaced by an alternative item that fulfils "a similar purpose".
  - Wargear (Mount): Wargear that grants the Mounted condition cannot be discarded.
  - Weapons: No fighters can discard weapons.

### Equipment Sets

Some fighters can have multiple equipment sets. The most valuable equipment set is used when calculating the fighter’s cost. A fighter can have the same piece of equipment in multiple equipment sets.

Only one equipment set can be used for a battle. If a battle uses random fighters, a fighter with multiple equipment sets will have one set selected randomly (can't choose which equipment sets to use).

NB: Fighters with weapons attached to the fighter can't have equipment sets (for example Augmetic weapons).

### Gang Hierarchy

Some fighters have the “Gang Hierarchy” ability:

- Can make post-battle actions (only fighters that are part of a gang).
- Leading By Example (X”).

### Leading By Example (X")

Can keep friendly models on the battlefield after the gang bottles.

After the gang bottles out, if passing the Fleeing the Battlefield (Cool) test in the End phase, any friendly models within X” automatically pass the Cool test and will not flee.

- Leader: 12”.
- Champion: 6”.

#### Notes:

- Only fighters from the same “group” are affected, for example Alliance or Gang.
- Keep in mind the role of walls and solid terrain features when measuring the distance between fighters

:::info N17-N21 (IMPROVED VERSION)
Champions can only use Leading By Example for models without this ability.
:::

### Free Skill

Some fighters start with a specific skill or can choose a Primary custom skill. This is free (already included in the cost) and does not affect gang rating.

### Weapon Restrictions

Most fighters have “Restrictions” for what weapons they can be given. By default, each gang will specify what weapons are available to each fighter in the Equipment List. Fighters can gain additional weapons from other sources (for example Trading Post or Black Market). A fighter may have limits on what type of weapons they can have:

- Pistol
- Basic
- Special
- Heavy
- Close Combat

A fighter can have access to all weapon types, some or none.

## Loss of a Leader

If the leader is killed or sold to the Guilders (after capture), a new Leader must be nominated from the gang according to this priority:

1. Champion & Champion (Specialist).
1. Ganger (Specialist) & Juve (Specialist).
1. Other fighters.

Tie-breakers:

1. Leadership.
1. Advancements.
1. Choose freely.

A promoted fighter have their Type changed to Leader and count as a Leader when determining which equipment and skill sets they can access. Existing stats and special rules do not change.
