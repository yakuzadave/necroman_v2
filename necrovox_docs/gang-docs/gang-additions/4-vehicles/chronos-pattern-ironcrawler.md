#### Fire Points

The Ironcrawler has five Fire Points on the transport cage: two on the left side, two on the right side, and one on the rear. Fighters in the transport cage have access to the Shoot (Basic) and Reload (Simple) actions. The Shoot (Basic) action is resolved from any one of the Fire Points. A Fire Point can only be used once per round. When using a Fire Point, fighters may not take the Aim (Basic) action, nor utilise weapons with the Unwieldy trait.

#### Transport Bed

The Ironcrawler has a transport bed behind the transport cage. Fighters and loot in this dedicated area don't fall off if the vehicle moves, Swerves or Jack-knifes (Loss of Control).
