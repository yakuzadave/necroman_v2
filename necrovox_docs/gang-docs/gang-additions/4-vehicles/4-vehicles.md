# Vehicles & Crew

For custom vehicles, see [Wasteland Workshop](/docs/gangs/gang-additions/vehicles/wasteland-workshop).

For vehicle upgrades, see their relevant sections in the Trading Post. Note that universal vehicles have restrictions on weapons prior to accessing the Trading Post, which can be seen in their respective columns.

Crew and Vehicle can either be universal (available to everyone except Ash Wastes Nomads), or gang-specific.
