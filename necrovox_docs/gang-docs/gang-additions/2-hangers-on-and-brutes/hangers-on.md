# Hangers-on

_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

Each of the different types of Hanger-on brings a
specific benefit or a special rule to the gang that
employs them. Hangers-on do not normally take part
in battles; their role is a non-combat one. However,
should a battle take place on the gang’s own turf
(i.e., when the gang has the Home Turf Advantage
in a scenario), roll a D6 for each Hanger-on before
choosing a crew. On a roll of 1, 2 or 3, the Hanger-on
is unfortunate enough to be around when the fighting
starts, and must be included as part of the crew.

Hangers-on cannot gain Experience or Advancements;
if they suffer a Lasting Injury that would make a change
to their Fighter card, they decide that the hideout is no
longer safe and move on – they are removed from the
gang roster. They cannot be given any equipment other
than what is listed.

## Hangers-on costs and restrictions

Some hangers-on are only available to particular gangs, and some have gang discounts.

**Gun-smith:** If a gang has an Ammo-jack, its weapons are regularly serviced and their ammo stocks are carefully maintained. As such, fighters from the gang can re-roll any failed Ammo checks that roll a natural 1. The Ammo-jack does not have to take part in the battle for the gang to receive this bonus, but if they are not available for
the battle, for example, if they are In Recovery or have been Captured, the bonus
does not apply.

If a gang has more than one Ammo-jack, the bonus increases. A gang with two Ammo-jacks can re-roll failed Ammo checks that roll a natural 1 or 2. A gang with three can re-roll failed Ammo checks that roll a natural 1, 2 or 3.

An Ammo-jack may be armed with either a boltgun or combat shotgun with salvo and

are equipped with mesh armour.

**Skills:** [Lie Low](/docs/gang-fighters-and-their-weaponry/skills/#5-lie-low).  
**Special Rules:** Slop Pot, Grub's Up, Part of the Crew.

<details className="">
<summary>Special Rules</summary>

**Slop Pot:** When Bigby Crumb is hired, he brings along
his Slop Pot. The Slop Pot is represented by its own
model and is placed within 2" of Bigby when he is
deployed on the battlefield. The Slop Pot may be moved
in the same way as a Loot casket (see the Necromunda
Rulebook) and counts as cover.

While within 2" of the Slop Pot, Bigby may perform the
Add Ingredients (Basic) action. When he performs this
action, choose one of the following effects:

- **Stinger Spore Stew:** Until the end of this round, friendly fighters within 2" of the Slop Pot count as having an assist when making Recovery tests (see the Necromunda Rulebook).
- **Frenzon Fondue:** Until the end of this round, friendly fighters within 2" of the Slop Pot gain the Nerves of Steel and True Grit skills.
- **Tentacle Surprise:** Until the start of Bigby’s next activation, the Slop Pot counts as a Beast’s Lair (see the Necromunda Rulebook). Note that Bigby does not trigger the Beast.

**Slopper:** Bigby Crumb is a Slopper Hanger-on and follows the Grub’s Up rule for aiding fighters In Recovery. If hired, he counts as the one Slopper a gang may include.

> **Grub’s Up:** At the end of the Spend Experience step of the pre-battle sequence, roll a D6 for each of the gang’s fighters that is In Recovery. On a roll of 6, a constant supply of good food has helped them recover more quickly – the fighter’s In Recovery box on the gang roster is cleared, and they are now available for this battle.

**Part of the Crew:** Unlike other Hangers-on, this fighter
is always ready for a fight. As long as this fighter is part
of the gang roster, they are treated just like a regular
Ganger for the purposes of selecting a crew. Therefore,
this fighter may be chosen or randomly selected as part
of their gang’s starting crew just like any other Ganger.
However, just like any other Hanger-on, this fighter
cannot gain any Experience or Advancements and,
should they suffer a Lasting Injury that would make a
change to their Fighter card, this fighter is removed from
the gang roster just like any other Hanger-on.

<details className="lore">

_Bigby Crumb was once the head chef to the Archduke of House Greim, brought in from the agri-world of Pravium Secundus especially for the job. As Bigby will freely admit, he has since fallen on hard times. As the Ratling slopper tells it, he was expelled from the spire after an unfortunate incident involving a Threadneedle Worm Surprise pie. Rumours persist that the dismissal had less to do with exploding pies and more to do with the Duchess of Greim’s dislike of Ratlings – who she claimed were far too small to be trustworthy. Whatever the reason for Bigby being turfed out of the spire, the nobility’s loss was the underhive’s gain. Down in the stinking depths of Hive Primus, Ratlings don’t usually warrant a second glance, especially in places like Sump City or Heretic’s Hole, where Ogryns and mutants regularly rub shoulders with Beastmen and wyrds. It was here, in the very depths of the hive, that Bigby found a new life turning aggressive sump flora and fauna into quite passable soups and stews._

_Unlike most sloppers, who pass themselves off as culinary experts just because they know how to siphon a water still, Bigby can actually cook. This has put him in high demand among the gangs of hive bottom. The price for hiring Bigby, though, is often joining him on one of his legendary (and equally dangerous) ingredient hunts, the Ratling delving deep into the badzones of the underhive in his search for exotic plants and animals to fill his slop pot. Some say he is merely looking to add new recipes to his repertoire, though others claim Bigby’s hunts have more to do with creating the perfect dish, one good enough to win his way back into the spire._

wilful and the training doesn’t work. A Brute Handler can only train one Brute at
a time.

In addition, if a Standing and Active Brute Handler is on the battlefield, and within
3" of a friendly Brute, the Brute gains the Nerves of Steel skill and can re-roll any
Leadership, Cool, Willpower or Intelligence checks it is required to make.

**Part of the Crew:** Unlike other Hangers-on, this fighter is always ready for a
fight. As long as this fighter is part of the gang roster, they are treated just like a
regular Ganger for the purposes of selecting a crew. Therefore, this fighter may
be chosen or randomly selected as part of their gang’s starting crew just like any
other Ganger.

However, just like any other Hanger-on, this fighter cannot gain any Experience or
Advancements and, should they suffer a Lasting Injury that would make a change
to their Fighter card, this fighter is removed from the gang roster just like any other
Hanger-on.

_Brutes are typically savage and dull-witted, herded into battle by gangs to increase their firepower and intimidate their enemies. Even those Brutes with the sense to listen to their leader’s commands in combat still need guidance and training, and Goliath Brute Handlers are ex-pit fighters or factorum overseers and know how to get the most out of muscle._

single dose of any Chem, chosen from the Black Market.  
**Special Rules:** Steady Supply.

<details className="">
<summary>Special Rules</summary>

**Steady Supply:** A gang with a Chem Dealer counts all Chems as Common
availability when buying them from the Trading Post or Black Market. Chem
Dealers can also, in a pinch, acquire Chems ‘on consignment’ during the pre-battle
sequence of a game. This allows the gang to buy a single dose or any Chem, or
items containing Chems, such as a single stimm-slug stash or medicae kit, without
expending any credits. However, during the post-battle actions step of the postbattle
sequence, the gang must pay for these items. If the gang cannot or will not
pay for any item, the Chem Dealer is removed from the gang’s roster. Should this
happen, news of the bad deal gets around, and the gang cannot hire another Chem
Dealer Hanger-on for the remainder of the current campaign.

</details>

<details className="lore">

_Chems are a vital resource in the underhive, and many gangs don’t like to leave acquiring them to chance. A Chem Dealer is a dedicated supplier for a gang and, for a bit of protection and some creds, provides a gang with chems when they need them. Of course, while Chem Dealers are not as vulnerable to criminal reprisals as freelancers, when a deal goes sour they can just as easily end up with a stub round in their brain._

_Necromunda is an exhausted world, its mineral wealth all but spent, and even its rich pools of waste chems or seams of scrap are jealously guarded by those who mine them. In such an environment, it is individuals such as the Claim Jumper who help the Ironhead Squat Prospectors find the best places to set up their great mining rigs. Grizzled loners used to operating far from their clan, Claim Jumpers have a nose for fermented toxic waste or crystallised promethium run-off, among a hundred other valuable resources unique to the outlands. Where a less experienced Squat might see only the shifting ashen face of Necromunda, the Claim Jumper detects tiny tells, like discolouration in dust dunes or the faint scent of rotting ferrosteel, pointing the way to a worthy find. Like all Squat technical or mining specialists, the Claim Jumper is aided by a Techmite drone of their own creation – in this case a Techmite Autoveyor. Autoveyors are as much a pet as tools, with their own unique machine intelligence. This allows them to hunt down minerals and treasure the Claim Jumper might have missed, using their drill appendage to bore into the ground (or sealed containers) and return to their master with their find – much like a Cyber-mastiff loyally returning to its owner, kill clutched in its jaws._

_True to their name, a Squat Claim Jumper does not limit their explorations to unclaimed minerals and wealth. More often than the Clan Houses would like to admit, Squat Prospectors, led by a Claim Jumper, have moved in on one of their newly staked mining sites, stripping it bare before they can properly set up shop. House Orlock in particular has clashed with the Squats over such breaches of claim – the Squats themselves operating outside of the rigid Clan and Noble House structure and so less concerned with contracts made between humans. As such, a Claim Jumper comes more heavily armed than one might expect, carrying power weapons, grenades and firearms, both for seeing off local wildlife or Ash Waste Nomads, but also in case they run into any rival prospectors._

_Doctor Arachnos works out of the Six Clans ‘Cutting Room’ in Dust Falls. Both Proctor Clause Bauhein and Mistress of Coin Melerva pay the Doc well for his services, and even Narco Lord Balthazar Van Zep has been known to go to him to save the life of an especially valued associate. A slightly sinister figure, no one quite knows where Arachnos comes from; he just turned up one day in Dust Falls with his chirurgical assistant, Craven Bonesaw, in tow – the small misshapen creature thought to be the product of one of Doctor Arachnos’ experiments. However, good medical aid is hard to come by in the underhive, especially of the kind Arachnos offers, and so he does a fine trade in digging out bullets and patching up ruptured organs._

_The Doc also has a healthy sideline in gen-hancements and organ grafting. For a modest fee, Doc Arachnos will cut an underhiver open and make ‘improvements’ to their physiology. Most often, these are purely practical – like implanting a Goliath pulmonary system to allow the patient to brea the toxic air, or a set of Phyrr Cat eyes so they can see in the dark. More rarely, gang leaders come to Arachnos looking for cosmetic enhancements such as ripper jack teeth or ash devil claws (which look scary but make opening a bottle of Wild Snake a small feat!). Of course, all these exotic components need to come from somewhere, and the Doc regularly signs on with gangs going down into the depths of the underhive. While Arachnos can, and does, pay for unusual organs procured by gangers, he prefers to extract them himself – rather than receive them in the battered remains of a corpse-starch ration tin wrapped in whatever dirty rag the ganger could find._

1 is rolled when rolling the D3, the Brute suffers a wound with no save possible. An
overcharged jump booster adds D6" to the Movement of a Wrecker (roll each time
the fighter is activated). If a natural 1 is rolled, then no extra Movement is
gained and the Wrecker may only perform a single action during its
activation, as they struggle to control their malfunctioning pack.

**Combat Ready:** A gang containing a Pit Trainer can train fighters between battles.
Up to three fighters, who are not In Recovery, can be trained at once. A fighter who
undergoes training gains a random skill, generated from their Primary or Secondary

removed from the fighter’s card at the end of the battle. If the generated skill is one
they already have, they may instead choose the temporary skill from their Primary
or Secondary skill lists.

However, when a fighter trains for the pit, there is a chance they will be injured. Roll
a D6 for each fighter in training. On a roll of 1, the fighter must immediately make a
roll on the Lasting Injury table and immediately apply the results. If a fighter suffers
an injury that puts them Into Recovery, they must miss the next battle.

<details>
<summary>Special Rules</summary>

**Psychoteric Echo:** A gang with a Psychoteric Thrall can use it as the focal point
when a friendly Delaque fighter performs a Wyrd Power action. Whilst this fighter is
not Engaged or Seriously Injured, a friendly Delaque fighter that is within 12" of this
fighter may choose to channel a Wyrd Power through this fighter.

That fighter makes a Willpower check as normal and, if a
double 1 is rolled, it is that fighter that will suffer the
effects of Perils of the Warp. However, the effect
of the Wyrd Power is worked out from the model
representing the Psychoteric Thrall, rather than
from the model representing the fighter. In
other words, line of sight, distance, range
and so forth are all measured from the
Psychoteric Thrall, not from the fighter
using the Wyrd Power.

**Disturbingly Familiar:** When a Psychoteric Thrall is added to the gang, make a note
of its House of Origin. This may be either House Cawdor, Escher, Goliath, Orlock or
Van Saar. This represents the origin of the unfortunate Thrall. Any enemy fighter
that belongs to that House suffers a -2 modifier to Leadership and Willpower checks
made whilst within 6" of this fighter. Any enemy fighter that does not belong to that
House suffers only a -1 modifier to Leadership and Willpower checks made whilst
within 6" of this fighter.

**Part of the Crew:** Unlike other Hangers-on, this fighter is always ready for a fight. As
long as this fighter is part of the gang roster, they are treated just like a regular Ganger
for the purposes of selecting a crew. Therefore, this fighter may be chosen or randomly
selected as part of their gang’s starting crew just like any other Ganger.

However, just like any other Hanger-on, this fighter cannot gain any Experience or
Advancements and, should they suffer a Lasting Injury that would make a change
to their Fighter card, this fighter is removed from the gang roster just like any other
Hanger-on.

_As an itinerant wanderer, Gunnstein served as a mercenary under all manner of masters, but after many decades he found himself at the Ring of Selene void docks that orbit Necromunda. There he chose the wrong side in a feud between a House Goliath longshore gang and one of the many fanatical Cargo Cults for the rights to handle cargo passing through the vast zero-G freight halls. Fleeing the ensuing chaos, he was very nearly eaten alive by an Ur-Ghul infestation, before being chased off-station by an angry heretek cult whose nascent techno-heresy he inadvertently exposed._

_At that point, Gunnstein decided it was time to retire, and so he smuggled himself into Hive Primus and struck out for the underhive with the intention of setting himself up as a weaponsmith to fund what he hoped would be a very long and quiet old age. Of course, life rarely turns out as intended, and his retirement has proven every bit as eventful as his previous career. Nonetheless, he makes a comfortable living working with a variety of underhive gangs, his skill at maintaining weapons and his keen sense of honour ensuring his services are ever in high demand. Despite his status as a hanger-on, Gunnstein rarely remains at the hideout while his current employers head out to fight, and he is well known for insisting on accompanying his latest friends into battle. Few ever demand he remain at home, for even in his retirement Gunnstein is more than capable of teaching the youngsters a thing or two about fighting._

**Patch Up:** If a gang has a Rogue Doc, it can make an additional Medical Escort
action in the post-battle sequence in addition to any other post-battle actions
performed by fighters with the Gang Hierarchy (X) special rule. This visit does not
cost any credits – however, a result of 6 on the table is treated as Stabilised rather
than a Full Recovery, due to the Rogue Doc’s comparatively limited supplies and the
lack of proper medicae technology.

If a gang has more than one Rogue Doc, it can make this additional action once for
each of them.

_Shivvers and Hive Oracles are an important part of Escher society, and often gangs will call upon their services. A Hive Oracle may, if she sees fit, set up residence in a gang’s hideout, often operating out of strange many-hued wagons or tents, filled with the objects and artefacts of their craft. Between battles, a gang leader can visit the Shivver, hoping for a glimpse into their future. Sometimes these glimpses can save the gang from calamities or lead them to great riches, though other times they may be misleading, or even dangerous, resulting in disaster._

<summary>Special Rules</summary>

**Vox Hack:** Silberlant Sevos can perform the Gather Intelligence (Double) action:

- **Gather Intelligence (Double):** Make an Intelligence test for Silberlant Sevos. If the test is passed your opponent must reveal all gang tactics they have generated, if the test is failed your opponent must reveal a random gang tactic they have generated.

**Whisper Merchant:** Silberlant Sevos is a Whisper Merchant. If hired he counts as the one Whisper Merchant a
gang may include.

**Useful Lies:** During both the pre-battle or post-battle sequence, a gang with a Whisper Merchant may count
the result of a single D6 roll as a 6 when taking the following actions: Determine Scenario, Choose Crews
(when random crew size applies), Receive Rewards (including rewards from Territories), and Seek Rare or Illegal
equipment. This ability can be used only once in each sequence and, each time it is used, make a note on the
gang roster. Once this ability has been used six times, the Whisper Merchant calls in their debt and the gang
must pay the hiring fee again or remove the Whisper Merchant from their gang roster.

**Part of the Crew:** Unlike other Hangers-on, this fighter is always ready for a fight. As long as this fighter is part
of the gang roster, they are treated just like a regular Ganger for the purposes of selecting a crew. Therefore,
this fighter may be chosen or randomly selected as part of their gang’s starting crew just like any other Ganger.
However, just like any other Hanger-on, this fighter cannot gain any Experience or Advancements and, should
they suffer a Lasting Injury that would make a change to their Fighter card, this fighter is removed from the
gang roster just like any other Hanger-on.

_As much as they would like their enemies to believe otherwise, the Delaque do not have a monopoly on the Necromundan secrets trade. Within Hive Primus, mysterious agents such as Nemo the Faceless move in the shadows dealing in rumours, while Hive Temenos boasts the Conclave of Truth, fallen priests whose sacrament is the lies they spread. Sevos the Infotek has made himself one of this esteemed company. An exile from House Van Saar, Sevos sought to merge his mind with the sacred STC, creating a synaptic-inload interface to extract his consciousness. Unfortunately for Sevos the STC rejected his attempts, leaving him shattered in both body and mind. His former brothers and sisters within the House of Artifice dumped his remains in the depths of the underhive, striking his true name from their records for his breaking of the Three Laws._

_While Sevos’ experiment might have failed to merge his mind with the STC, it did have unexpected results. While he lay in refuse, his body dying and his thoughts unravelling, he discovered he could see the electronic soul of the hive all around him. Not only could he see it, but he could also interact with its systems. Reaching out and taking control of a clade of maintenance servitors, he had the base creatures carry him to safety and bring nourishment for his failing body. Over cycles, he took control of more hive systems, using plundered tech to build himself a suspensor chair to carry his body and protect it from harm._

_It was not long before Sevos discovered that, in addition to manipulating nearby hive systems, he could also steal data secrets as they were transmitted along the electro highways of the towering city. Washing away any trace of his past, Sevos set himself up as a Whisper Merchant, growing rich from his trade in information. When the Great Darkness tore apart the social fabric of Necromunda, Sevos was one of the first to see it coming and took refuge in his underhive hideout, remotely manipulating events from the shadows. Later, when he heard the first whispers of the Prophet and the great pilgrimage that would follow, he saw an opportunity to fulfil his ambition to merge with the Van Saar STC… and take his revenge on the Clan that had left him to die._

<summary>Wyrd Powers</summary>

A Spyker is a Psyker and knows the following
Wyrd Powers:

- **Psychic Scream (Basic):** Any enemy fighters within
  3" of this Psyker must immediately pass a Nerve
  test, subtracting 1 from the result. Any enemy fighter
  that fails this test is immediately Broken and runs
  for cover.
- **Psychic Assault (Basic):** Nominate an enemy fighter
  anywhere within 18" of this Psyker. The nominated
  fighter must immediately take a Willpower check. If
  the check is passed, the fighter is Pinned. If the test
  is failed, the fighter loses 1 Wound and is Pinned. If
  this reduces the fighter to 0 Wounds, roll one Injury
  dice and apply the result.
- **Force Blast (Basic):** Any enemy fighters within 3" of
  this Psyker are immediately pushed D3+1" directly
  away. If this movement would push a fighter from a
  platform or into a pitfall, stop at the edge and take
  an Initiative test for them. If the test is passed, they
  are placed prone at the edge. If the test is failed,
  they will fall. If this movement is interrupted by
  a wall, or other impassable terrain, the fighter is
  immediately Pinned and takes a hit with a Strength
  equal to the number of inches rolled for the
  push distance.

<summary>Optional Rules: The Confluence of Shadows</summary>

:::note Designer's Commentary

Presented below are special rules that will allow you to recreate the events described in Sump City Sinking. If the Arbitrator wishes, these rules can be used by any Delaque gang during a campaign.

:::

During the Choose Crews step of the Pre-battle Sequence, any Spykers may choose to use the following wyrd powers instead of those presented in _Necromunda: House of Shadow_ (above).

**Crush (Basic):** Target a single enemy fighter or obstacle that is both within 12" and line of sight of this fighter and make a hit roll, using this fighter's BS. If a hit is scored, an obstacle is destroyed and removed from the battlefield, while an enemy fighter must make a save roll. If this save roll is successful, roll an injury dice and immediately apply the result against the fighter.

**Witchfire (Double):** All enemy models within 3" of this fighter suffer a S5, D2, AP-1 hit as if from a weapon with the Blaze trait.

**Mind Maze (Basic, Continuous):** Target a single Standing and Active enemy fighter that is both within 6" and line of sight of this fighter. The target must make an initiative test, if the test is failed they change their status to Prone and Pinned. Additionally, while this power is maintained, each time the target activates they must make an intelligence test, if the test is failed then any ranged or melee attack they perform during their activation suffers a -1 penalty to kit.

One additonal enemy fighter may be chosen as the target of this power for each friendly Delaque fighter within 3" of the Wyrd that is Standing and Active.

<summary>Special Rules</summary>

**The Finest Merchandise:** Having an Underhive
Trader around means the gang has access to all
manner of goods. More importantly, they can use
the Trader’s connections to find rare goods. An
Underhive Trader can make the Trade action
during the post-battle sequence just as if they
were a Leader.

**Specialist Product:** Most Underhive Traders have their own specialities and when
hired on to the gang players must choose one of the following Trader types, gaining the
additional benefits listed here:

- **Relicmonger:** A purveyor of religious trinkets, a Relicmonger can adorn a gang’s
  fighters with blessed tokens – some of which might, very occasionally, actually do
  something. Once per battle, when a fighter with blessed tokens is Seriously Injured
  or taken Out of Action, roll a D6. On a result of 6, the fighter can ignore the result.
- **Beastwrangler:** A procurer and tamer of Exotic Beasts, a Beastwrangler can train
  a gang’s exotic pets while they rest in the gang’s hideout. At the start of each
  campaign week, add 1 XP to each Exotic Beast in the gang.
- **Gun-smyth:** Able to procure the best guns in the underhive, Gun-smyths are highly
  valued by gangs looking to gain an edge over their opponents. A gang that has a
  Gun-smyth can upgrade one ranged weapon purchased from the Trading Post or
  Black Market to have the Mater-crafted trait at no extra cost. Each Gun-smyth can
  do this once per post-battle sequence.
- **Connected Trader:** A Connected Trader has spent a lifetime building up a web of
  contacts they can use to move items. If a gang has a Connected Trader then once
  per post-battle sequence for each Connected Trader they control, they may double
  the credits they gain for selling items in their Stash. In addition, they may freely
  trade credits and items in their Stash with other gangs participating in the same
  campaign; note that both gangs must agree in order for a trade to happen.

<summary>Special Rules</summary>

A gang with an Agitator can make bold claims about their prowess and
righteousness over their enemies, though such boasts are not without their
dangers. In the pre-battle sequence a gang can declare they are using their
Agitator to spread word of their impending victory. If they win the game then
they gain an extra D3 Reputation. If they lose the game, they must reduce their
Reputation by an additional 1.

An Agitator also improves recruitment for the gang. When the gang rolls to see if
they get a free fighter from a Territory, such as those provided by a Settlement, they
may roll twice and choose the result they want.

**Outlaw:** An Agitator can only be hired by Outlaw gangs.

:::note Designer's Commentary

Presented below are special rules that will allow you to recreate the events described in Twins of Two
Tunnels. If the Arbitrator wishes, these rules can be used during a campaign.

:::

**Rile ‘em Up (Basic):** The Agitator fires up their allies, extolling the glory that awaits them. All friendly fighters
within 12" of the Agitator may add 1" to their Movement characteristic until the end of this round.

_Cults and criminals often use propaganda to spread their message throughout the hive. Specially trained individuals give speeches, paint slogans on walls and spread subversive rumours among the citizenry. These propagandists might be devout followers of the cult, but can equally be skilled orators and liars working for their own selfish ends._

<summary>Special Rules</summary>

**Arthromite Whisperer:** During the Post-battle Sequence a Nomad Arthromite
Herder may tend to the wounds of an Arthromite Duneskuttler. If the Arthromite
Duneskuttler is Critically Injured, it goes into Recovery; otherwise roll a D6, on a 3+
the Arthromite Duneskuttler heals any lasting injuries it has and goes into Recovery.
This cannot be performed in the same Post-battle Sequence as the Training
Program ability.

**Training Program:** During the Post-battle Sequence, a Nomad Arthromite Herder
may attempt to train an Arthromite Duneskuttler; make an Intelligence test for the
Nomad Arthromite Herder, if successful, the Arthromite Duneskuttler earns D3
XP. This cannot be performed in the same Post-battle Sequence as the Arthromite
Whisperer ability.

<details className="lore">
<summary>Lore</summary>

_The Ash Waste Nomads have a strange affinity for the creatures of the wasteland, especially the Dustback Helamites that they ride into battle. More insidious than these surface-running creatures are the massive insects that live beneath the ground. Known commonly as Arthromites, these huge creatures often lie in wait for unwitting prey, burrowing under the surface of ash dunes and leaping to terrible life when a traveller or even a vehicle moves over it. The creature then overpowers their catch, tearing and biting before ultimately dragging it beneath the sand or ash._

_Even on their own an Arthromite can be more than a match for a human, and Nomad Arthromite herders will train these creatures to do their bidding. Clad in the discarded exoskeletons of their charges, an Arthromite herder is often accompanied by an Arthromite Duneskuttler – sending them charging toward their foes with little more than a gesture of their hunters polearm, the Duneskuttlers falling upon the hapless target seconds before the herder themself joins the fray. Though Duneskuttlers are by far from the most common insects to be found in the command of a herder, there are rumours of even larger more terrible beasts that they can control – with herders often travelling deep into the wastes and returning with horrors seldom seen in civilised lands._

**Purification through Pain:** During the pre-battle sequence, after setting up the
battlefield but before choosing crews, a gang with a Flagellator may attempt to
bring one of its fighters out of Recovery. The chosen fighter immediately makes a
Toughness check. If this check is passed, the fighter leaves Recovery and may be
included in the crew for this battle. However, this fighter begins the battle with
one Flesh Wound.

**Outlaw:** A Flagellator can only be hired by Outlaw gangs.

_Purification through pain is a common belief of the Redemption, and gangs sometimes employ specialist flagellators to motivate and ‘heal’ their members. A wounded ganger, or one suffering from some underhive malady, may well forget their injuries and get back in the fight if staying in the gang’s hideout means regular whippings._

If a gang includes a Heretek then it can have them enhance one of the gang’s

fighter from your crew. One of the weapons carried by the fighter gains either the
Blaze, Concussion, Power, Rad-phage or Shock trait, as chosen by the controlling
player. The weapon also gains the Unstable trait, or the Reckless trait if it has the
Melee trait as well. These traits last until the end of the battle.

**Sermon:** A gang with a Hive Preacher may roll a D6 at the end of any pre-battle
sequence and add this many Faith dice (see page 97) to their Faith dice pool. In
addition, if a Hive Preacher is on the battlefield and not Seriously Injured, then they
count as three fighters when determining the number of Cawdor fighters generating
Faith dice in the End phase.

**Part of the Crew:** Unlike other Hangers-on, this fighter is always ready for a fight.
As long as this fighter is part of the gang roster, they are treated just like a regular
Ganger for the purposes of selecting a crew. Therefore, this fighter may be chosen or
randomly selected as part of their gang’s starting crew just like any other Ganger.
However, just like any other Hanger-on, this fighter cannot gain any Experience or
Advancements and, should they suffer a Lasting Injury that would make a change
to their Fighter card, this fighter is removed from the gang roster just like any other
Hanger-on.

**Outlaw:** A Hive Preacher can only be hired by Outlaw gangs.

An Outlaw gang with a Proxy can sell captives to the Guilders and may use
the Trading Post. However, each time they do so they must roll a D6, and on
a result of 5+ the action fails. The gang can also attempt to make an Alliance
with the Merchants Guild or the Imperial House. If it does, before the Alliance
is formed roll a D6. On a 6, the Alliance fails and the Proxy is removed from the
gang’s roster, otherwise the Alliance is formed as normal. If an Outlaw gang
is ever required to Test the Alliance with the Merchants Guild or the Imperial
House then the Alliance is automatically ended without the need to roll.
