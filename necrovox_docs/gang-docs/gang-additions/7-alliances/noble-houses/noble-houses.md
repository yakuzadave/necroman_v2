## House Greim (330)

**Strong alliance: Goliath**

_House Greim is one of the seven Great Houses of Necromunda, standing shoulder to shoulder with the likes of House Ulanti, Ran Lo and even House Helmawr itself. Based in the spire of Hive Primus, the House owns huge portions of the planet’s weapons manufacturing capacity, and has built itself up as the ‘military’ House of the hive world. That the vast majority of its members have never seen a battle hasn’t stopped it from proclaiming itself the preeminent military family of all Necromunda. Resplendent in campaign medals and ornamental weaponry, the lords of House Greim march about the spire conducting business like they are waging war. And perhaps they are. In the struggles between the Great Houses, the scions of Greim have survived for centuries, using one stratagem or another to outwit their foes. It also helps that Greim claim ownership of the titles and structures of the Necromunda Militia regiments, from which the Astra Militarum draws troops to serve the Imperium. This means many militia commanders, as well as representatives for the Imperial Guard, owe House Greim for their commission and their position on Necromunda._

_Lord Ludwig Greim, Krieger-Lord of the Palatine Cluster, and Marshal of Helmawr’s Ash Militias, rules over his kin with military precision. Ordnance turned out by the Clan Houses is inspected and tested by the Great House’s agents, the finest selected to bear the mark of House Greim itself, and gifted to their prize battalions and companies. It is a form of blatant favouritism that Lord Helmawr willingly tolerates, much like the affected military titles and puffed-up personalities of House Greim. The Lord of Necromunda knows that by allowing Ludwig and the nobles of Greim to play at soldier, they will support him against the other Houses, their loyalty bought with a few shiny medals._

_House Goliath, renowned for the strength of their gangers and the quality of their steel, has been a close ally of House Greim for many generations. The Goliaths enjoy the favours that the Great House can bestow, along with lucrative Astra Militarum weaponry contracts, while the Greim entertain notions of one day raising a regiment comprised entirely of Goliaths. Only the sanction of Lord Helmawr, and the Imperium’s distrust of abhumans, has so far stymied House Greim, though the time might yet come when the Goliaths march to war._

### Benefits

#### The Finest Ordnance

Any friendly Gang Fighter can re-roll any Ammo tests.

#### An Eye For War

Modify the roll for determine scenario with +1/-1. If this ability is used, the Military Attaché must be included in the crew.

#### Military Attaché

_While the upper echelons of House Greim would never countenance setting foot on an actual battlefield – even from the relative safety of an Astra Militarum Leviathan command transport – they have no qualms about sending their lower-ranked sons and daughters down-hive to experience a bit of ‘real’ warfare. Krieg Mesters are lesser nobles of the House who keep an eye on their parents’ investments. No less pompous for their lower standing, they dress and act like officers of the Imperial Guard, replete with their own uniforms and fancy weaponry. Competent in combat, if not born for it, they are never seen without their Jagerkin – bonded servants of House Greim, drawn from veterans of the Militia or the Imperial Guard, and tasked with keeping their Krieg Mester alive._

_Attached to underhive gangs, Krieg Mesters offer tactical advice and oversee the field testing of House Greim funded weaponry. Most gang leaders tolerate the presence of a Krieg Mester because of the wealth their Noble House offers, or because their own Clan House has coerced them into cooperation. Occasionally though, the noble officer really knows what they are talking about, and on their advice some gangs have managed to turn the tide against their enemies, or win battles that seemed all but lost._

## House Ulanti (460)

**Strong alliance: Escher**

_House Ulanti is among the oldest of all the Great Houses, their history intertwined with that of House Escher itself. Though many centuries separate the nobles of Ulanti from the rulers of Escher, the two remain closely linked in countless ways. Much of the Ulanti interests on Necromunda are tied to the production of chems and their sale to the wider Imperium. Each cycle, the Great House draws huge revenues from the world’s drug trade, making the percentage taken by the Merchant Guild, the Narco Lords, and even House Escher, who produce the chems, seem insignificant by comparison. Ulanti, like all Noble Houses, has its hands in many other industries, allowing Clan Houses and Merchant Guild families to use its factories and territories in exchange for a hefty slice of their output. Several hives are owned outright by the Great House, such as the Skygelt Tower on the edge of the World Sump, or Hive Valkyria in the highest reaches of the Spoil. The Great House even owns the Necromunda moon of Juggerata, where its nobles go on safari, hunting xenos beasts brought in especially for this purpose._

_All this wealth and privilege has, over centuries, saturated House Ulanti with a level of decadence considered extreme even by the standards of the Necromundan nobility. Lords and ladies of the House live in ridiculous luxury. Their levels within the spire are often transformed into fairy-tale lands, paradise realms or fantastic menageries filled with every kind of exotic creature imaginable. The Ulanti also dine upon the rarest food and drink of the galaxy, from hydro-clonic cocktails created with the refined alco-aqua of five different death worlds, to albino-gyrinx flesh that can only be harvested one day a year and must be eaten in natural sunlight lest it turn into a deadly poison. With all this decadence, it might be assumed that the Ulanti themselves are useless wastrels with little to personally offer the world of Necromunda, and for the most part such an assumption would be right. However, there remain within the Noble House individuals of great power and vision who see to its survival. These men and women are often skilled warriors or gifted leaders, but their true power comes from House Ulanti’s greatest weapon – its near-limitless wealth._

### Benefits

#### Excessive Wealth

+2D6x10 credits during the post-battle sequence.

#### Court Advisor

_Sometimes, agents of House Ulanti are dispatched into the lower regions of the hive to oversee important dealings or to observe the endeavours of its subjects and allies. This kind of interference from on-high can be a boon to a Clan House or Guilder family, as the Ulanti bring with them vast amounts of wealth and influence, as well as skilled warriors and their own talents for conflict resolution. Equally, having such an important individual shadowing a gang can present its own risks – for instance, how best to explain to a family that their loved one caught a stub round in the head in a bar fight in an especially insalubrious part of the underhive. Fortunately, those House Ulanti Courtiers that do see fit to visit Hive City, or the underhive, are usually trained duellists, having perfected their skills on servants in mock-battles in the spire. These entitled tourists also bring their own bodyguards with them. The Ulanti favour the use of Mirror Masks, augmented warriors who wear hologramatic masks to look like their masters. These noble doubles are designed to confuse assassins, as well as make the noble look good – one can be sure that any impressive combat feats perpetrated by the Mirror Mask will be claimed by the Courtier. Both Courtier and Mirror Mask also have access to the finest in personal weaponry their House can afford and, given the deep coffers of theUlanti, these are very fine indeed._

_In recent times, numerous House Ulanti Courtiers have travelled down-hive looking for the noble outcast Princess D’onne Ulanti, who remains enemy number one for the Great House. So far, though, House Ulanti has found no sign of their wayward daughter – unless you count the Courtier bits routinely sent back to the spire._

:::

## House Ran Lo (370)

**Strong alliance: Orlock**

_If the Mercator Gelt count Necromunda’s coins, then House Ran Lo guard its coffers. The Great House long ago established itself as the hive world’s bankers and creditors, their legions of scriveners responsible for the countless debts and loans that keep the planet’s wealth firmly in the hands of Lord Helmawr. It is a sacred position on a world as wealthy as Necromunda, and the Imperial House relies heavily upon Ran Lo for both its assistance, and its discretion. Understandably, this position means most of the other Great Houses despise House Ran Lo, even more so than the general hatred they have reserved for each other. While the other Noble Houses must rely upon political manoeuvring, or the efforts of clandestine agents, to get their way, House Ran Lo only needs to tighten its purse strings to exert almost unbearable pressure._

_The lords and ladies of House Ran Lo are universally austere and serious, dressing in severe clothing of dark or drab colours, putting them in stark contrast with their peers. In conversation they are blunt and to the point, having little love for pomp and ceremony, making social functions in the House Ran Lo areas of the spire dull and painful affairs for other nobles. These traits might seem like a strange pairing with the rough and rebellious reputation of House Orlock. However, for the wealth of Necromunda to flow, goods must make it to Hive Primus – and when it comes to transportation no one is as efficient as the House of Iron. The alliance between Orlock and Ran Lo has endured for centuries – the House of Iron moving the goods, and the Noble House paying the bills._

### Benefits

#### Always More Coin

Gain 2D6x10 credits after each battle the allies take part in (regardless of the outcome).

#### Checks and Balances

Gain 2D6x10 credits after each battle if any opponent earned more credits from the scenario than the allied gang.

#### Aid

Success level: 11 or less  
Fighters: Auditing Conclave

<FighterCard cost="180">

### 1 Auditor (Leader)

_To ensure their investments are yielding the expected returns, House Ran Lo may decide to dispatch an Auditing Conclave. These severe and pitiless individuals are universally feared throughout the hives. Many clan lords, who wouldn’t flinch from facing a swarm of Ripper Jacks or a slavering Phyrr Cat, pale at the thought of meeting a Ran Lo Auditor. This terror is well founded, as the Auditor can inflict terrible and lasting wounds upon a settlement, organisation or gang, levying crippling taxes upon them or ensuring their access to the Merchant Guild and its goods and services suddenly disappears._

_Auditing Conclaves like to get a first-hand look at a situation, and do not shy away from combat like many other nobles. Of course, a dead man cannot pay their debts, so Auditors favour suppression and non-lethal weapons, and are very adept at their use. Should the Auditor be seriously threatened, their bodyguard, the Gelt-scrivener will stepin. These are talented combat-hardened individuals who have chosen to pay their debts to House Ran Lo through service, and know that should their master die, they will never be free of their obligations to the Great House – andso fight all the harder to protect them as a result._

## House Ko'iron (500)

**Strong alliance: Cawdor**

_The matriarchal line of House Ko’iron can trace its lineage back thousands of years on Necromunda. Though its survival for such a long time is often put down to the double-dealings of its nobles, and their knack for picking the winning side more often than not, the truth is Ko’iron endures because of its faith. The devout matriarchs of the Noble House have always enjoyed close ties with the Ministorum on Necromunda, and dominate the upper levels of Hive Temenos – much of their wealth tied up in the grand cathedral at its peak and the countless pilgrim trails and shrines that crisscross the planet below. There are even rumours that the House was founded around the same time as the Adepta Sororitas, during the Age of Apostasy, and somehow the two are linked. Certainly the noble women of Ko’iron enjoy the confidence of the Sororitas mission on Necromunda, and many of their daughters end up joining the ranks of the Battle Sisters._

_With such close associations to the Imperial Creed, it is little wonder that Clan Cawdor has found a sponsor in House Ko’iron._

_Though the roots of the Redemption do not dig deep into the families of the Noble House, its members recognise the importance of the faithful in the lower reaches of the hive and support the spread of the Redemption to the godless places of the toxic world. House Cawdor is also an excellent source of soldiers for the armies of Ko’iron, or as tithe warriors for the Frateris Militia, sent to the Ministorum in their tens of thousands to gain favour with the local Ecclesiarchs._

_In return for their devotion and their manpower, the pious matriarchs provide the Clan House with genuine holy objects drawn from the stores of the Ministorum, such as blessed battlefield relics like the bloodstained armour of martyrs, or incense made from the grounddown bones of missionaries. Sometimes these rare and wondrous items might even find their way into the hands of a Cawdor gang, where they are treasured beyond words and drive the faithful into even greater heights of divine rapture._

### Benefits

#### The Emperor Protects (Same as: Pious + Fanatical)

All fighters in this alliance can re-roll Nerve & Rally tests if the result is 2 (before modifiers).

#### Religious Relics

A leader can have 1 item (armour or weapon) Blessed (while allied):

- Re-roll a failed hit or save (once per battle).

#### Ministorum Delegation

_When House Ko’iron wishes to interact with the faithful of the lower hive, they will send forth one of their MinistorumDelegations. Led by a Prima Materis and defended by a pair of veteran Frateris Bodyguard, the delegation wraps itself in the trappings of the Imperial Creed. On the surface, the Prima Materis is a priestess of the GodEmperor, and her blessings are welcomed by the lowly inhabitants of the hive. Clan Cawdor especially flock to the outstretched hand of the Materis, her touch akin to the grace of the God-Emperor for such unworthy souls. Behind the ritual and prayer, however, the Prima Materis is very much an agent of House Ko’iron, and enforces its will within the lower reaches of the hive city. Gangs and gang leaders, especially those of House Cawdor, are manipulated into doing the bidding of the House, while acts of industrial sabotage, expansion or murder are veiled behind the will of the most holy Emperor._

_While the Prima Materis is herself a competent warrior, armed with a shock stave and boltgun, both emblazoned with the symbols of her House, it is the Frateris Bodyguard who keep trouble at bay. Veterans of wars of faith, often returned from off-world, these scarred soldiers wear well-worn armour under their robes, and are experts in the use of the chainblades and lasguns they carry._

## House Ty (300)

**Strong alliance: Delaque**

_The great and mysterious House Ty claims its ancestry from the Nihon Empire and Dragon Isle of Ancient Terra. Whether there is in fact any true connection between the progenitors of House Ty and those long-lost peoples is highly debatable, though it does not stop the nobles of the House from dressing in flowing embroidered silks covered in the spidery script of lost Nihonese languages and emulating everything they know of Ancient Terran customs. This identity may spring from House Ty being one of the youngest of the Noble Houses and considered ‘new’ nobility by some of the older ones such as Ulanti. As a result of this, Ty is eager to make its mark upon the world. This eagerness is also doubtless why House Ty is so closely allied to the Delaque, the mere fact the two are known to have secret dealings is enough for many of the Noble Houses to be wary of openly opposing the Ty._

_This union also ties into the chief area of influence of the Noble House – the conveying of messages and the trading of secrets. Under the auspice of the Imperial House, House Ty maintains more psykers than any other Noble House and provides large numbers of recruits for the Adeptus Astra Telepathica._

_On Necromunda, many within Lord Helmawr’s own stable of psykers and astropaths wear the jade robes of House Ty along with the white or black mantles of their station, and there are rumours that everything that passes from their lips to the Master of Necromunda’s ears is also heard by House Ty and, ultimately, House Delaque. What House Ty gets in return for the secrets it passes on is another mystery, though one that keeps the lords and ladies of the Noble Houses awake in the night cycles._

### Benefits

#### Psychic Training

While allied, a fighter with Psychoteric Mastery (or any Psyker if no fighters have Psychoteric Mastery) gains +1 Wyrd Power from those available to that fighter. This is lost if the Alliance is Broken.

#### House Ty Onmyodo Coven

_At any one time on Necromunda, there are thousands of telepathic psykers in the employ of the Imperial House. The most powerful of these are part of the Astropathic Choirs of the Adeptus Astra Telepathica which conveys long range messages from Necromunda to Terra and other far-flung worlds, though there are many more who use their gifts to communicate between the Noble Houses, or other esteemed institutions on Necromunda, where simple vox communication is either impossible or too risky. The Onmyodo Covens of House Ty serve this function and are a unique pairing of psyker and null carefully cultivated by the Noble House for the purpose of telepathy and divination. Always in twos, one member of the Onmyodo is a powerful telepath capable of peering into the minds of Lord Helmawr’s servants but with their own power kept in check by a psychic null. Both null and psyker wear control collars to further regulate their powers, the Noble House able to activate or deactivate a collar depending on the role the coven will be playing._

_House Ty Onmyodo Covens are sometimes sent by the Noble Houses to the underhive where they shadow gangs and gather information, or act as a direct line to their masters in the spire. Of course, as welcome as the power of such skilled telepaths and psychic nulls are to a gang, they can never be entirely sure who the Astropath answers to, and just which noble lord might be looking out through their glassy eyes from the safety and comfort of their tower atop the hive._

## The Imperial House

**Strong alliance: Palanite Enforcers**

_House Helmawr stands above all other Houses of Necromunda. It is rightly known as the Imperial House, a house sanctioned by the Imperium itself to rule. For seven millennia, a Helmawr has governed the blighted hive world, keeping both nobles and clans in line as well as the countless billions of helots, workers and subjects. It is both the glory and the burden of the Imperial House to see the Emperor’s tithe is paid − and reap the immense wealth and reputation their position provides. As rulers of Necromunda, House Helmawr are both the law and the law makers, there being nothing and no one beyond their extensive reach. The Enforcers, the militant arm of Lord Helmawr’s control, exact his will wherever their booted feet are heard stomping down tunnels and through domes, while his legions of scribes and scriveners see to it that the other nobles and clans are kept in line. A complex web of alliances and obligations is the foundation upon which this control is built and all who would wield power on Necromunda do so only upon the sufferance of Lord Helmawr._

_When gangs ally themselves with the Imperial House, it is because they have been granted the official sanctioning of House Helmawr. Often, this means appointment as de facto rulers of a region, or perhaps a clandestine force within the underhive operating beyond the reach of the Enforcers. In either case, as most gangers will tell you, a pact with the Imperial House is a double-edged sword. For every boon the Imperial House grants, it often demands two- or three-fold in return. Woe to the gang that crosses Lord Helmawr or fails to pay his tithes − for just as the great Imperium of Mankind looks unkindly upon any world that fails to meet its due, so too does Lord Helmawr deal harshly with any of their subjects that fail to please them._

### Benefits

#### Law Abiding Allies

Any gang may form an Alliance with the Imperial
House, provided it is a Law Abiding gang.
The House of Helmawr has no interest in
collaborating with the criminal classes.

#### Imperial Appointment

When a gang allies with the Imperial House, they
may select one of their Territories (or
equivalent) to be officially appointed as
theirs by the Imperial House. The gang
may perform the Collect Tithe post-battle action:

- **Collect Tithe:** Receive the boon from the Territory an additional time.

#### Enforcer Bodyguards

In the pre-battle
sequence the gang may add Enforcer
Bodyguards to their gang
for the battle ahead. These fighters do
not cost a gang any credits to hire, but
if chosen, they must be included in the
gang’s crew, even if crew selection is
normally random.
If the gang is playing against an Outlaw
gang then the Enforcer Bodyguards must
be included unless the gang rolls to Test
the Alliance.

### Drawbacks

#### Imperial Tax

During the post-battle sequence, if the gang gained any credits as a scenario reward, the gang must give up a portion of this to the Imperial House:

- The gang must give D3x10 credits to the Imperial House. If the amount rolled is greater than the amount gained, the gang must make up the deficit from their Stash or Test the Alliance.
- Alternatively, the gang can choose to keep all of its rewards, but if they do they must Test the Alliance.

### Enforcer Bodyguards

_Palanite Companions are the elite Enforcers of the spire. Hand-picked from the most loyal subjects of Lord Helmawr’s Palanite battalions, they are utterly devoted to their noble masters. Each one undergoes extensive psycho-conditioning until their single-minded purpose is to protect those of Helmawr blood − or those deemed important by the House nobility. Companions are so named because they seldom leave the side of their masters − Lord Helmawr’s personal retinue is never more than a handful of strides from his side, and never completely out of his line of sight._

#### Helmawr’s Protectors

During the pre-battle sequence, after the Choose Crews step, the Palanite Companions are assigned to protect a fighter of the allied gang’s choice.

#### A Band Apart

Members of the Imperial House take care of their own. Palanite Companions will remain separate and aloof from the gang they are working beside, disappearing during the post-battle sequence to tend to their wounds. If a Palanite Companion goes Out of Action during a battle, there is no need to roll for Lasting Injury; they are considered to have rolled 12-26 Out Cold.

#### "Here to Help"

Unlike other fighters, Enforcer Bodyguards are not counted during the Choose Crew step of the pre-battle sequence. Instead, at the end of this step, these fighters may (and, in some cases, must) be added to the crew, regardless of the Crew Selection method in use. This may take the number of fighters in a starting crew above the number specified by the scenario.
