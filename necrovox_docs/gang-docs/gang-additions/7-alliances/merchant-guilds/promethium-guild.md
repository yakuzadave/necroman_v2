# Promethium Guild

_Source: House of Artifice_

_Power in all its forms, whether created by burning promethium or tapping into a hive’s great heat sink, is controlled by the Pyrocaen Lords of the Promethium Guild. House Van Saar maintains close ties with both the Mercator Pyros and the Mercator Lux, the generation and use of energy on Necromunda key to the wealth and power of the House of Artifice._

## Benefits

**Law Abiding Allies:** Any gang may form an Alliance with the Promethium Guild
provided it is a Law Abiding gang. The Guilds of Necromunda have no interest in
collaborating with the criminal classes.

**Strong Alliance (House Van Saar):** The first time a gang belonging to House Van Saar is required to Test the Alliance (see page 75) with this ally, do not roll. Instead count the result as Disquiet.

**Helmawr’s Radiance:** While the gang is allied with the Promethium Guild, any
plasma or flame weapons (i.e., plasma pistol, plasma gun, plasma cannon or any
combi-weapon with a plasma component, or any weapon with the Blaze trait) owned
by the gang loses the Scarce trait, or, if they did not have the Scarce trait, gains the
Plentiful trait.

**Pyromantic Conclave:** While the gang is allied with the Promethium Guild, in the pre-battle sequence the gang may attempt to add Guild Representatives in the form of a [Pyromantic Conclave](#pyromantic-conclave) to their gang for the battle ahead:

Roll a D6 and add the gang’s current Reputation:

- If the total is 11 or below, the Promethium Guild deigns to aid their allies on the battlefield.
- If the total is 12 or more, the Guilders decide the gang can cope alone.

This group of fighters does not cost a gang allied to the Promethium Guild any credits
to hire, but if chosen they must be included in the gang’s crew, even if crew selection
is normally random. If, however, the gang is playing the Looters, Smash and Grab,
Caravan Heist or Escort Mission scenario and is the defender (see Guard Duty as
follows) then a Pyromantic Conclave must be included. Roll a D6 and add the gang’s
current Reputation:

- If the total is 11 or below, the gang is glad of this aid.
- If the total is 12 or more, the gang is unhappy about this forced interference and they must Test the Alliance.

## Drawbacks

**Guard Duty:** During the pre-battle sequence, if the gang has the option of choosing
the scenario to be played, roll a D6. On a 1, 2 or 3, the gang must choose Looters,
Smash and Grab, Caravan Heist or Escort Mission, and take on the role of the
defender. On a 4+, they can choose any scenario as normal. Alternatively, instead of
making this roll, the gang can choose to play any scenario, but if they do they must
Test the Alliance.

**Power Tap:** During the post-battle sequence, if the gang gained any credits as a
scenario reward, the gang must give up a portion of this to their Guild allies:

- The gang must give D3x10 credits to the Guild. If the amount rolled is greater than
  the amount gained, the gang must give the full amount gained to their allies and
  the Alliance is automatically tested.
- Alternatively, the gang can choose to keep all of its rewards, but if they do they
  must Test the Alliance.

## Pyromantic Conclave

_By flickering flame or glowing orb, the Pyrocaen Lord moves through the darkness of the underhive. Power in all its forms is controlled by the Promethium Guild in the underhive, with severe punishments dispensed upon those who presume to steal promethium. Pyrocaen Lords are both merchants and murderers, offering settlements trade in the form of burnable fuel or sanctioned thermal taps, but also holding executions by flame and electrocution for those who have been taking more than their due. With excessive promethium at their fingertips, Pyrocaen Lords favour ostentatious flame weapons, overpowered examples of common hive ordnance, designed not just to destroy but also to intimidate. These powerful individuals are also often held aloft on roaring flame and jet-driven palanquins, never setting foot on the soiled ground of the underhive as they have the fuel to waste for both their comfort and protection._

_Alongside the Pyrocaen Lords are the Pyromagir and Cynders. The former are the bearers of the eternal flames, which they carry on their backs in huge burning cauldrons of promethium. It is from this flame that symbolic fires are lit or that the lord dispenses the gift of heat and light to the less fortunate. Then there are the Cynders, surgically altered bodyguards who cast fire in the path of the Pyrocaen Lord, heralding their coming or immolating their enemies._

### Composition

A Pyromantic Conclave consists of one Pyrocaen Lord, one Pyromagir and two Cynders.

### Pyromantic Conclave Special Rules

**Light in Dark Places:** If the player controlling the Pyromantic Conclave chooses, they may announce during the
pre-battle sequence, after crews have been chosen but before deployment, that the battle will be fought using the
Pitch Black rules. Additionally, they may choose during any End phase that these rules no longer apply. Finally, if
any member of the Pyromantic Conclave is removed from play, immediately before removing the fighter, resolve a
photon flash grenade attack centred on the fighter.

**A Band Apart:** Members of the Pyromantic Guild take care of their own, especially valued representatives and
their favoured attendants. A Pyromantic Conclave will remain separate and aloof from the gang they are working
beside, disappearing during the post-battle sequence to tend to their wounds. If a Pyromantic Conclave fighter
goes Out of Action during a battle, there is no need to roll for Lasting Injury; they are considered to have rolled
12-26 Out Cold.

**“Here to Help”:** Unlike other fighters, a Pyromantic Conclave is not counted during the Choose Crew step of the
pre-battle sequence. Instead, at the end of this step, these fighters may (and, in some cases, must) be added to
the crew, regardless of the crew selection method in use. This may take the number of fighters in a starting crew
above the number specified by the scenario.
