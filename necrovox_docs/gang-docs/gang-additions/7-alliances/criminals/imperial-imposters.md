  - Ammended **An Honorable Word**

</details>

_Faux nobility are well-versed in the mechanisms of power that run Necromunda, and the aid of an Imperial Imposter can elevate a gang to unheard-of levels of power – provided they don’t get caught. House Van Saar is, in many ways, as much a clan of secrets as the Delaque, the preservation of the STC requiring unseen hands working in the darkness – and for this the House of Artifice both employs and sponsors Imperial Imposters._

## Benefits

**Criminal Allies:** Any gang may form an Alliance with an Imperial Imposter provided
it is an Outlaw gang. The nature of their operations makes Fallen Houses deeply
distrustful of Law Abiding gangs.

**Strong Alliance (House Van Saar):** The first time a gang belonging to House Van
Saar is required to Test the Alliance (see page 75) with this ally, do not roll. Instead
count the result as Disquiet.

**An Honourable Word:** While the gang is allied with an Imperial Imposter, they can
protect themselves or another gang from being outlawed. At the start of a Campaign
week, choose a gang (this can be the player’s own gang). For the duration of this
Campaign week, the selected gang can ignore any one action that would result in
them changing alignment. If a gang that is allied with an Imperial Imposter changes
alignment, it must Test the Alliance but does not add 3 to the dice roll.

If a gang that is allied with an Imperial Imposter changes alignment in a Law and Misrule campaign, it must Test the Alliance but does not add 3 to the drice roll. When visiting the Trading Post, the allied gang may ignore the -2 modifier to the Seek Rare Equipment roll for being an Outlaw gang.

**Uphive Ambassadors:** In the pre-battle sequence the gang may add a [Master Charlatan](#master-charlatan) to their gang for the game. This Hired Gun does not cost a
gang any credits to hire, but if chosen they must be included in the gang’s crew, even
if crew selection is normally random.

If the gang is playing the Murder Cyborg, Shoot-out or Escort Mission scenario then a
Master Charlatan must be included unless the gang rolls to Test the Alliance.

## Drawbacks

**Noble Ambitions:** During the pre-battle sequence, if the gang has the option of
choosing the scenario to be played roll a D6. On 1, 2 or 3 the gang must choose
Looters, Forgotten Riches or Caravan Heist. On a 4+ they can choose any scenario
as normal. Instead of rolling the gang can choose to play any scenario, but if they do
they must Test the Alliance.

**Guilt by Association:** During the post-battle sequence, if the gang fielded a Master
Charlatan they must roll a D6. On a 6 their association has been discovered and the
gang is outlawed. Instead of rolling, the gang can dissociate itself from the Imperial
Imposters, but if they do they must Test the Alliance.

<summary>Lore</summary>

_Master Charlatans blend seamlessly into Necromunda high society. Dressed as nobles and adopting their affectations they work towards their own ends – which is usually robbing the Noble Houses mercilessly. Some have deeper agendas – often because they are in the employ of other Noble Houses or vengeful renegades, though these are the exception rather than the rule. Then there are those who find their way down into the underhive. These duplicitous individuals play off the locals’ ignorance of noble conventions to live comfortably or manipulate those around them – though the price of discovery is usually being hung from the settlement walls or thrown down the deepest, darkest hole around._

_A Master Charlatan might aid a gang by offering unique talents such as disguising themselves as the gang’s rivals on the battlefield or spreading disinformation before or after confrontations. Sometimes they might even appear as specific members of their allies’ own gang, such as a noteworthy leader or champion, fooling the enemy long enough for them to be ambushed. Should the Master Charlatan be revealed, they are still a deadly prospect to face, their lifestyle having afforded them a wealth of concealed weapons and wargear._
