# Orlock Terrain

_Source: House of Iron_


Gangs often make use of terrain in their battles against their rivals. Sometimes this
is whatever is lying around the underhive battlefield, such as barrels for cover or
boltholes from which to launch ambushes. Other times they bring the terrain with
them, setting up fixed weapon platforms, defensive barricades or piles of ammo crates
within easy reach of their fighters.

Orlock gangs can call upon a number of specialist terrain features to include in their
gang. These pieces of terrain are bought from the Trading Post during the post-battle
sequence. Once bought, they are added to the gang’s Stash, and can be fielded in any
battle the gang plays unless noted otherwise.

## Placing Gang Terrain

Gang terrain is placed on the battlefield before any fighters are deployed. A gang
can place its terrain in its own deployment zone, or, if noted, in no-man’s-land (i.e.,
anywhere outside their opponent’s deployment zone and their own deployment zone).
Some pieces of terrain (as noted in their descriptions) can only be used if the gang is
the defender in a scenario with an attacker and a defender.

## Sawn-Off Surprise (Booby Trap)

Sawn-off shotguns are a staple of House Orlock gangs, and find dozens of uses in
their crews, including as part of traps to blast unsuspecting foes. A Sawn-off Surprise
is a Booby Trap, and follows the rules for Booby Traps. It should be represented by a
marker, or model on a 25mm base. When a Sawn-off Surprise explodes, all fighters
within 3" take an automatic hit from a Sawn-off shotgun.

## Promethium Barrels

Bullet-riddled barrels of waste promethium make for useful hazards when it comes
to gang warfare. Orlock gangs will roll these barrels into an area before a fight, where
their foul contents can leak out to saturate an area, ideally catching enemy fighters in
the slick, hindering their movement and making them prone to burst into flames!

A Promethium Barrel can be represented by a marker, an appropriate piece of terrain,
or a model on a 25mm base. These pieces of terrain may be placed anywhere on the
battlefield at least 3" from the enemy deployment zone. If a fighter, from either crew,
activates within 3" of one of these markers, they can only make a single Move (Simple)
action during their activation. In addition, if a fighter within 3" of a Promethium Barrel
is hit by a weapon with the Blaze trait, add 1 to the dice when rolling to see if they are
set on fire.

## Servitor Sentry

Servitors are used extensively throughout the hives of Necromunda, and House
Orlock employs vast numbers of them for the autonomous piloting of transport rigs
and cargo sorters. Some of these servitors find their way into Orlock gangs, most
gangers favouring ‘Luggers’ for their size and ability to carry heavy weapons. Many
of these are ripped right out of their old machines and lack arms or legs, being little
more than a torso driven by mono-programming – more than enough to operate
an autogun.

A Servitor Sentry can be represented by a marker, an appropriate piece of terrain, or
a model on a 25mm base. The servitor can only be deployed when the player’s gang
is the defender in a scenario with an attacker and a defender, and then it must be
placed within their deployment zone. Servitors cannot move themselves, but can be
moved by friendly fighters in the same way as a Loot casket. A Servitor Sentry has the
following profile:

|  M  | WS  | BS  |  S  |  T  |  W  |  I  |  A  | Ld  | Cl  | Wil | Int |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
|  -  | 6+  | 5+  |  2  |  4  |  1  | 6+  |  1  | 12+ | 4+  | 6+  | 12+ |

#### Special Rules

**Living Wargear:** This model counts as a fighter in all regards, but cannot gain
Experience, and counts all Lasting Injuries as Out Cold results. In addition, they
automatically pass any Cool or Willpower checks they are required to take and
automatically fail any Leadership or Intelligence checks they must make. They do not
count for the purposes of Bottle tests, nor can they be included in a Reinforcement
deck, and must always be deployed on the battlefield, in addition to the specified
crew size.

#### Equipment

A Servitor Sentry may be armed with either an autogun or a shotgun with solid and scatter ammo.

## Tool Box

All Orlock fighters carry tools on their belts, these ubiquitous kits a mark of being
a member of the clan, as well as the difference between life and death out in
the wastes. Sometimes a gang might bring along heavier equipment to help with
the servicing of their weapons, vehicles or servitors. Carried around in old ammo
containers, these tool boxes contain everything the gang might need for field repairs.

A Tool Box can be represented by a marker, an ammo crate or an appropriate model
on a 25mm base. A Tool Box can be moved in the same manner as Loot caskets (see
the Necromunda Rulebook). A friendly fighter within 1" of a Tool Box can take one
Reload (Simple) action for free when they activate. In addition, a Cyber-mastiff, Ambot,
Servitor Sentry or ‘Lugger’ Cargo Servitor that activates within 1" of a Tool Box can
remove a single Flesh Wound or recover a single lost Wound on a D6 roll of 4+.

## Road Relic (Gang Relic)

House Orlock gang relics are altars to the road gods of Necromunda. Fashioned from
scavenged parts of destroyed ash-runners, crawlers or mighty war-rigs, they remind
the gang of their mastery over the Ash Wastes and its trade routes. Often these relics
will be hung with icons of the road, such as wheels, fuel tanks, or battered gun turrets
– some of which still work.

A Road Relic counts as a Gang Relic (see the Necromunda Rulebook) and can be
represented by a marker, an appropriate piece of terrain or a model on a 40mm base.
In addition, a friendly fighter in base contact with a Road Relic can crew one of its
turrets, using the following profile:
