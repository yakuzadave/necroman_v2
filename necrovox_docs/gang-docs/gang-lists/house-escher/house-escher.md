# House Escher

_At once ancient and youthful, the House of Escher has endured far longer than any other Clan House of Necromunda. Under one name or another, they can trace their lineage back to the age of Martek Helm’ayr, the first Lord Helmawr, and, it is rumoured, even beyond that. Few now know of the early centuries of House Escher, the past of the clan hidden behind ritual and history. Rather, they are seen as what they have become: a matriarchy built upon a throne of chems and violence. These are the pillars of what it means to be Escher, a drive to prove their strength through skill at arms and reckless aggression, fuelled by a chemical empire that mixes Imperial science with pagan ritual. To outsiders, Eschers are cruel and deadly warriors, a perfection of the female fighter on Necromunda. Their gangs stalk the underhive alongside strange and exotic beasts, the mere touch of their weapons enough to corrupt blood or set a victim’s nerves on fire. Above these youthful and energetic gang warriors toils a House more prosperous than any on Necromunda – all women born beneath the beneficent smile of a Clan Chymist equal in the eyes of the Matriarch Primus and her Council of Crones. Thus may an Escher prove herself no matter the manner or place of her birthand, should she do well in the concoction of chems, therearing of xenos beasts, or fighting for the clan in the endless inter-House wars, she may well rise up to join the council herself – or perhaps even don the mantle of Matriarch Primus._

Of course the life of a Gang Queen is seldom a long one. As any Escher will tell you: the cost of living life on the edge is that eventually you fall over it._

It is no surprise then, that should the Gang Queen fall, it is one of the Matriarchs who will inevitably take her place as mistress of the gang._

_House Escher has a long and somewhat shadowy history in dealing in off-world life forms. It is well known that they make extensive use of strange and exotic creatures to fuel their pharmaceutical production, and the fact that it provides the raw materials for their outlandish costumes appears to be a fortuitous by-product. Most of these xenos life forms come the House’s way legally, through sanctioned trade with the Noble Houses of the upper spires and long-standing contracts and permits allow House Escher ready access to the segmentum’s most illustrious pedigree beast breeders._

_More disturbingly, perhaps, is the fact that House Escher runs a dark and hidden trade in the creation of new life from the creatures they deal in. Gene-spliced hybrids, flesh-fused chimerae and other, darker fusions of different species are commonly created. Provided that House Escher continues to avoid the use of intelligent xenos life in their experimentation, the Imperial House continues to turn a blind eye, and so these dumb monstrosities are produced and sold to the gladiatoria to entertain the crowds, kept as attack beasts to guard and protect Escher holdings, and quite often make their way into the ranks of particularly well renown Escher gangs, where they add considerably to the status of Leaders and Champions._

_House Escher has a long tradition of dealing in many strange and exotic off-worldcreatures. At its most basic, this trade in xenos fauna helps to fuel many of theHouse’s unique elixirs and forms no small part of the basis for its trade and expertisein alchemical technology. A side effect of this prodigious, and often illicit, tradeinxenos lifeforms, is that House Escher has access to the pelts and plumage of manywonderful beasts, and this is clearly evidenced in the Escher style of dress. It is alsonot uncommon for House Escher to bring onto Necromunda the creatures that featurein the fighting pits and gladiatoria, a trade, which in turn, enables the House toset up ever more contacts amongst the many big game hunters and Rogue Traders that specialise in such commodities._

_However, not all off-world beasts are destined for the Escher laboratoria or thefightingpits of Necromunda, some creatures are prized as companions, especially thevariousfelids that originate on many different worlds. Escher gangers are attracted to thebigcats of Phyrr in particular for their exotic looks and killer instincts. Such beasts arerare in the extreme and smuggling them planetside to Hive Primus is no meanfeat, sothey are an incredibly rare sight as pets even amongst the hierarchy of HouseEscher. Yet seen they are, and when the opportunity to acquire such a beast, or even better, amating pair, arises, Escher gang queens will go to any lengths to secure them._

_House Escher has created countless gene-smithed felinoid creatures. One of the most successful is the Phelynx, or Venom Cat. A mix of reptilian biology and Phyrr Cat genes, it is an excellent hunting beast. Phelynx are used almost exclusively by the Wyld, the Runners driving entire packs of the creatures before them into battle. As their name implies, a Venom Cat’s bite can be deadly, its neuro-toxic venom able to incapacitate or kill in moments. Wyld Runners routinely apply Phelynx venom to their weapons, while some even imbibe it in small doses to build up a resistance to the toxins. Venom Cats are also naturally stealthy beasts and, like the Wyld Runners themselves, are masters of ambush. Part of this stealth comes from the creature’s instinctive grace and speed, the rest from its unique biology. Unlike Phyrr Cats, Phelynx are coldblooded, their bio-signs barely registering at all, making them extremely difficultto spot with auspexes._

_The bond between Phelynx and Wyld Runner is one built over a lifetime. When an Escher juve joins the Wyld, she will be given a weapon to master or a pet to train – this often coming in the form of an infant Phelynx. Over years of hunting and battle the Escher and beast become inseparable, one able to anticipate and coordinate with the actions of the other in a way no two human gangers could ever hope to match._
