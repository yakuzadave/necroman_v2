# Delegation Gangs

_Source: Book of the Outcast_

_When an individual decides, or is forced, to become an outcast they do not always go alone. Although rare, it is not unheard of for their fellow brothers and sisters in arms to join them._

Necromunda boasts a variety of unique fighters dedicated to the various factions of Necromunda found in a variety of books. Some of these can be adapted into Underhive Outcasts gangs, allowing players to create a gang based upon a Guild, Criminal or Noble Delegation. If the player wishes, and the campaign Arbitrator agrees, players can use such a Delegation as the heart of their Underhive Outcasts gang as follows:

- Choose one of the Delegations listed below and deduct their cost from your starting Stash (note that costs for individual fighters are included for the purposes of the gang roster and Fighter cards – you cannot hire them separately). Some Delegations are single models (such as Fallen Nobles) and as such should be added using the rules for Elevating a Fighter to Leader Status.
- Add the Delegation’s fighters to your gang roster with the equipment listed in the Delegation’s entry. During a campaign, they have the same equipment restrictions as an Underhive Outcasts fighter of the same rank.
- The Delegation Leader must be given an Affiliation to match their Delegation type (see page 19).
- The Delegation Leader and any Champions must be given Archetypes (see page 26).
- The Delegation Leader and any Champions gain the Tools of the Trade special rule (see page 18) and can perform post-battle actions.
- The remainder of your Stash may be spent as normal on Underhive Outcasts fighters; they all count as members of the Delegation for rules purposes (note that you can still only have one Leader and the limit on the number of Champions still applies).
- If an Underhive Outcasts Delegation ganger becomes a Specialist, they have access to the same skill sets as an Underhive Outcasts Specialist.
- An Underhive Outcasts Delegation gang cannot form any Alliances.
