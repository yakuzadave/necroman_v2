# Palanite Enforcers

_Necromunda endures by the grace of the God-Emperor and His inexhaustible armies, but beneath the world’s toxic storm clouds it falls to the agents of the Imperial House to maintain the peace and enforce the law. When one must govern a populace of billions, all crammed into the close confines of ancient cities and eking out their lives on recycled food while they toil endlessly at their tasks, kind words and even-handed rules are not enough. Only a boot stamping down on the throat of the ungrateful and malcontent will do; the fear of sudden and brutal reprisal keeping millions of desperate souls in line. This monumental responsibility of maintaining order among the hellish confines of the hives falls to the Palanite Enforcers._

_More akin to an army than a police force, the Enforcers trade in violence and control, purging settlements and habzones if even the faintest hint of sedition against Lord Helmwar’s rule is uncovered. All manner of crime is met with a swift and vicious response, for those that transgress against the Imperial House must be brought to justice before they can corrupt others with their recidivist dogma. Such brutality is born not of a cruelty among the Palanite Enforcers or the sadistic will of Lord Helmawr himself, but rather as a simple necessity. The Enforcers are always significantly outnumberedby the people they are meant to control, a thin line of shotguns and shock batons keeping billions of hivers under their yoke._

## Gang Composition

Enforcers follow [normal rules](core-gang-creation.md) with the following exceptions:

- New gangs must have at least 2 Gangers of the same type as the Leader (Palatine or Subjugator).
- Otherwise, the gang can consist of any mix of Palanite & Subjugator fighters.
- Must have at least 1 Ganger for each Leader and Champion in the gang.
- All fighters can have multiple equipment sets.
- Gangers must become Specialists to gain skills (as normal).

## Special Rules

Follow normal rules as other gangs with the following exceptions:

- All fighters (except Juves) can carry any weapon types (no weapon type restrictions).
- Fighters cannot be upgraded to Subjugator after recruitment.
- Cannot hold territories in Dominion campaigns. See [Palanite Enforcers in Dominion Campaigns](#palanite-enforcers-in-dominion-campaigns).

</WeaponStats>

**Weapons:** Shock bite.  
**Wargear:** Hardcase: [light carapace (4+)](/docs/armoury/armour#carapace) & [respirator](/docs/armoury/personal-equipment#respirator).  
**Special Rules:** Tenacious, Hardcase, Faithful Protector.

#### Tenacious

If taken Out of Action while not yet activated this round, this fighter is not removed from the battlefield until after completing its activation.

#### Hardcase

Hardcase Cyber-mastiffs are completely cybernetic and thus very hard to kill. A Hardcase Cyber-mastiff
counts as being equipped with [light carapace armour](/docs/armoury/armour#carapace) and a [respirator](/docs/armoury/personal-equipment#respirator).

#### Faithful Protector

While Standing (Active or Engaged) and within 3” of its owner, enemy fighters may not make a Coup de Grace against the owner.

In addition, if the owner is Standing and Engaged when activated, and the Hardcase Cyber-mastiff is within 6" of them, the Hardcase Cyber-mastiff may immediately be moved into base contact with one or more of the fighters Engaging the owner. Thismove counts as a free action.

_For as long as Mankind has utilised canines for hunting and companionship, it has used them to guard and to protect. In enforcing the laws of Lord Helmawr, canines are an invaluable tool, one that cannot be corrupted by the temptation of power or bribed by the lure of wealth. Their loyalty lies entirely with their masters and their dedication is unswerving._

_As a matter of course, the canines that serve alongside the Palanite Enforcers of Necromunda are heavily-modified brutes, routinely fitted with armour to protect their vital organs and upgraded with bionics to enhance their performance. The nature of such enhancements varies, from advanced sensory arrays that can be tailored to the role of watchdog or hunting hound, to combat upgrades such as iron jaws and razor-edged fangs. It is these combat modifications that are seen most widely in the underhive and the gangs of Necromunda have rightly learned to fear the deployment of Hardcase Cyber-mastiffs on their turf._

**Skills:** [Got Your Six](/docs/gang-fighters-and-their-weaponry/skills/gang-specific-skills#1-got-your-six).  
**Weapons:** Pacifier assault claw, heavy shock baton, grenade launcher array with photon flash grenades.  
**Wargear:** [Light carapace armour](/docs/armoury/armour#carapace).  
**Special Rules:** Automated Repair Systems, Mobile Bulwark.

#### Automated Repair Systems

During the Recovery and Restart step of the End phase, do not roll if this fighter recovers from being Seriously Injured − it automatically recovers as if a Flesh Wound had been rolled on the Injury dice.

#### Mobile Bulwark

If a friendly fighter is in partial cover due to being obscured by a Sanctioner Automata, they instead count as being in full cover.

#### Options

An Enforcer ‘Sanctioner’ Pattern Automata can replace their pacifier assault claw and/or heavy shock baton with one of the following:

| Upgrade                                  | Cost |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---- |
| Concussion cannon                        | +80  |
| Sanction pattern mancatcher              | +100 |
| SLHG pattern assault ram ‘Sledge hammer’ | +40  |

An Enforcer ‘Sanctioner’ Pattern Automata can take the following additional grenades types for their grenade launcher array: •

| Upgrade            | Cost |
| ------------------ | ---- |
| Choke gas grenades | +35  |
| Scare gas grenades | +45  |
| Smoke grenades     | +15  |
| Stun grenades      | +25  |

An Enforcer ‘Sanctioner’ Pattern Automata can upgrade its
light carapace armour to heavy carapace armour:

| Upgrade               | Cost |
| --------------------- | ---- |
| Heavy carapace armour | +20  |

_To keep Helmawr’s peace, Enforcers employ semi-sentient servo-automata designated ‘Sanctioners’. These hulking machines are driven by the cranial remains of a Palanite Enforcer whose personality profile matches those prescribed for ‘Sanctioner’ use − the subject given extensive psycho-conditioning before their brain is removed, dissected and placed within the confines of the automata. Unlike the ‘ambot’, which is driven by the animal instincts and nervous system of an Ambul, the Sanctioner has a human mind controlling its actions− albeit one devoid of emotion and dedicated utterly to the letter of the law. For this reason, gangs often call these machines ‘Lawtomata’, saying you’d find more mercy at the hands of a Corpse Grinder Cult than under the gaze of a Sanctioner._

_A Sanctioner is armed and armoured for the pacification tasks it is so often required to undertake. Heavy carapace plates protect the already robust inner workings of the Sanctioner, making them largely immune to small arms fire or the crude melee weapons often employed in uprisings or by outlaw gangers. Some Enforcer units, such as the Subjugators, often uparmour their automata further, to deal with more heavily armed resistance. Even discounting all their armour, Sanctioners have a reputation for being notoriously difficult to kill, the massive cybernetica rising again and again after taking punishing amounts of weapons fire as their internal repair systems keep them going._

_The hulking automata’s arms incorporate weapons for both crowd control and gang warfare − one arm ending in a pacifier assault claw, known to criminals and gangs as the ‘Fist of Dread’ for the brutal damage it can inflict. Alternatively, it can replace the fist with a concussion cannon, an ideal weapon for stunning foes before hauling them off to the local Precinct-Fortress. Its other arm is equipped with a sanction pattern mancatcher to restrain and detain any who get in its way._

_A Sanctioner is able to engage targets at longer range using an integrated grenade launcher. Grenades are a favoured tool of the Enforcers because of the variety of situations they can deal with − and the Sanctioner is no different. Flash, choke, scare and stun grenades are all useful to break up crowds or take the fight out of criminals, while smoke grenades provide cover for advancing Enforcers._

_Sanctioners are usually only released from their storage chambers within a Precinct-Fortress in the case of large scale hive uprisings, though occasionally patrol sergeants might find themselves using them to bring law and order to especially wild regions of the underhive. In the wake of the Great Darkness, with loyalties divided and general unrest across all of Necromunda, more and more Sanctioners have been activated, while the number of ‘volunteers’ chosen to donate their brains to bolster the robot’s ranks has increased tenfold._

## Palanite Enforcers In Dominion Campaigns

An Enforcer Patrol can be fielded in a Dominion
Campaign if players wish (see the Necromunda
Rulebook), but due to their nature will function
differently to other gangs in a few important ways.

### Territories And Campaign Phases

Enforcers cannot occupy and control Territories
like other gangs can. Instead, they start the
campaign in control of a single Territory unique to
them – the Palanite Precinct Territory.

**Occupation Phase:** During the Occupation
phase, Enforcers may challenge another gang
for a nominated unoccupied Territory as normal.
Similarly, another gang may challenge the Enforcers
to fight for a nominated unoccupied Territory as
normal. If the Enforcers win, rather than take control
of the Territory, they must perform either a Police
Territory or Grant Territory action (as follows).

**Takeover Phase:** During the Takeover phase, the
Enforcers may challenge any gang for a Territory
that gang controls. If the Enforcers win, they must
perform either a Police Territory or Grant Territory
action (as follows).

If, however, another gang challenges the
Enforcers during the Takeover phase then the
gang is assumed to be launching a bold assault
against the Enforcers’ Palanite Precinct Territory
(as follows). The challenger cannot gain control
of the Palanite Precinct, but will gain the benefits
of a successful assault should they win. The
Enforcers cannot lose the Palanite Precinct, but
can suffer the negative effects associated with it
being successfully assaulted.

### Territory Actions

If the Enforcers win control of an unoccupied or
enemy-held Territory, they must perform one of
the following actions during the Wrap-up:

**Police Territory:** The Enforcers clear up the
Territory. In a series of shock assaults and raids,
they shut down criminal enterprises and flush
out troublemakers:

- The Enforcers gain control of the Territory, but they gain no Boons from it.
- Immediately after taking control of the Territory and after every successful defence of the Territory, the Enforcers gain D3+1 Reputation for purging the Territory of crime.

**Grant Territory:** The Enforcer player chooses another gang taking part in the campaign.
That gang gains control of the Territory andanyCriminal Enterprises associated with it.

### Triumphs

Players of Palanite Enforcers may not be awarded the Dominator Triumph. Instead they have a unique Peacemaker Triumph to reach for:

**Peacemaker:** If none of the players can be awarded the Dominator Triumph – because two or more players hold the same number
of Territories – the Enforcer is awarded the Peacemaker Triumph.

### Unique Territory – Palanite Precinct

Fortress, gaol, and place of execution, a Palanite Precinct is the authority of Lord Helmwar stamped boldly into the very structure of the underhive in rockcrete and plasteel for all to see.

### Homeground

If challenged in the Takeover phase, the ensuing battle will automatically take place within the Palanite Precinct, representing a bold gang assaulting the Precinct:

- When the Palanite Precinct is assaulted, the battle will automatically be fought using Zone Mortalis terrain.
- The player that controls the Enforcers sets upall of the tiles, doors, barricades and any other terrain features. They also can decide if any of
  the doors are locked. The player who controls the Enforcers treats all doors as unlocked, and can relock any door.
- The player who controls the Enforcers automatically has the Home Turf Advantage when the Palanite Precinct is assaulted.

### Territory Boon

**Income:** The gang earns D6x10 credits from this Territory when collecting income.

**Gang Assault:** A gang can never take control of a Palanite Precinct. If, however, a gang should assault the Palanite Precinct and win the ensuing battle, that gang will gain +5 Reputation.
