# Genestealer Cult

_Few threats to the Imperium are as insidious as that posed by the Genestealer. A perfectly crafted organism, its sole purpose is to infiltrate and subvert the populations of entire worlds._

_Genestealer Cults are utterly loyal to their leaders in a way not even the word-keepers of House Cawdor could hope to impose. It is a link forged of genetics, a compulsion woven into each member’s flesh, and thus utterly unbreakable. Without the direct influence of a brood lord, or the specialised mutations of the fourth generation, these splinter cults instead serve the strongest among their kind, often drawn from the first and second generation of their bloodline. These Cult Adept and Cult Alpha are far longer-lived than their heritage would suggest, as if their blood, mixed with that of the xenos, responds to the psychic needs of their family and so strengthens and elevates them. Under their sway hybrid Acolytes and Neophytes serve as foot soldiers, many passing for human, and even those who cannot are often mistaken for merely yet another of Necromunda’s countless mutant inhabitants. Aberrants too can be found within the splinter cults, mistakes of biology, nonetheless given purpose in battle against the cult’s enemies._

_Almost all splinter cults are grown from mining families, and even generations on they use this guise to exist unnoticed among a world of humans. Clad in hazard suits and armed with a variety of scavenged weapons, mostly mining tools, splinter cults can form formidable gangs, as even the most primitive of blades can prove deadly when wielded by the hand of those who believe so completely in their cause. Tragically though, at least for the cult, their lifecycle remains stunted. Perhaps because of their separation from their distant brood father, Purestrains remain denied to them. In all likelihood, however, true glory still slumbers within the flesh of the family’s members and should the brood father ever call them to his side, they will continue their march towards the next stage of their deadly evolution._

_There is no way to tell how many of these splinter cults exist on Necromunda, cut off from the broodthing of Secundus, growing ever larger without any real goal save expanding their territories and extending their bloodline. A few though have made their mark, their names growing in the dark and cursed by their enemies, though still far beneath the notice of the Imperial House and its vast armies._

## Gang Composition

A Genestealer Cults gang must follow these rules when it is founded and when new fighters are added
to the gang:

- There must be one Leader, this may be either a Cult Adept or a Cult Alpha, chosen when the gang is first founded.
- The total number of Neophyte Hybrids in the gang must always be equal to, or higher than, the total number of other fighters (Leader, Hybrid Acolytes and Aberrants) in the gang, not counting Hangers-on.
- A fighter can be equipped with a maximum of three weapons. Weapons marked with an asterisk (\*) take up the space of two weapons.
- Any fighter may take Wargear.
- Weapon accessories marked with a dagger (†) may not be combined together on the same weapon. If one such accessory is purchased for a weapon, another may not be added.

During a campaign, all gangs continue to follow the above rules as new fighters are added to the gang. Additionally, the following rules apply:

- A gang founded for a campaign can contain no more than two Hybrid Acolytes. Additional Hybrid
  Acolytes may be added to the gang during the course of the campaign.
- During the course of a campaign, any fresh recruits added to the gang may be equipped with items
  currently held in the gang’s Stash, rather than purchasing new equipment.
- During the course of the campaign, gangs may gain new equipment, either by purchasing it from the Trading Post or as a result of Territory Boons. These items are added to the gang’s Stash and may be distributed among fighters during any post-battle sequence:
- A fighter cannot be given a new weapon of a type not allowed by their entry within this gang list. Aberrants and Neophyte Hybrids cannot be given a new weapon if it would take them above the limit of three weapons carried.
- A Leader or Hybrid Acolyte can be given more than three weapons as they can have multiple Fighter cards, each representing a different ‘set’ of equipment, as described on page 95 of the
  Necromunda Rulebook.
- A fighter may discard any Wargear carried when given new Wargear. Discarded Wargear is placed in the gang’s Stash.

## Special Rules

#### Extra Arm

- +1 weapon slot (4 instead of 3).
- Can attack with 3 weapons (Sidearm/Melee) in close combat (instead of 2).

If armed with a ranged Unwieldy weapon:

- Shooting ranged Unwieldy weapons becomes a Basic action (instead of Double).

Otherwise:

- +1 unarmed Attack with Rending (regardless of the weapons used).

#### Gaining Experience

Genestealer Cults gain experience like normal. Aberrants advance like Gangers.

#### Captured Fighters

Members of a Genestealer Cult are worth more when sold to the Guilders; the gang that is selling them receives their full value in credits instead of half their value.

#### Loss of a Leader

Nominate a new leader in the following order:

1. Champion
1. Ganger
1. Specialist
1. Otherwise:  
   Use Leadership as first tie-breaker and number of Advancements as second tie-breaker. If there is still a tie, choose one. The fighter becomes an Adept if they are a later generation (no Extra Arm) or Alpha if the fighter is early generation (Extra Arm). From now on they count as a Leader for determining which equipment and skill sets they can access. Their characteristics do not change.

#### Campaign

Claim Resource bonuses just like any other gang.

**Dominion:** Treated as an Orlock gang for the purposes of gang specific Resource bonuses.

#### Special Resources

- Settlements generate free Gangers (later generation, no Extra Arm) instead of Juves.
- Genestealer Cults can't have a Guilder Contact Resource (re-roll the result). If a Guilder Contact Resource is stolen from another gang, it is simply removed instead.

#### Post-battle Actions

- If any member of the gang is escorted to the Doc with a Medical Escort action, the cost is increased to 3D6x10 credits.
- Genestealer Cult gangs can't make the Sell to the Guilders action.
- Should the gang fail to rescue a captive held by a Genestealer Cult gang then the Cult can make them disappear - simply remove the captive from the campaign.

### Hangers-On, Hired Guns And Dramatis Personae

Genestealer Cults gangs may hire Dramatis Personae and Hive Scum in the same way as other gangs. Dramatis Personae Bounty Hunters joining a Genestealer Cults gang are subject to the Dead, Not
Alive, Claiming Bounties and “We’ll Get Our Bit…" special rules.

Additionally, Genestealer Cults gangs may hire Hangers-on, but they use the following table:

|    Reputation     | Maximum Hangers-on |
| :---------------: | :----------------: |
|   Less than 10    |         1          |
|     10 to 14      |         2          |
|     15 to 19      |         3          |
|     20 to 24      |         4          |
| Each additional 5 |         +1         |

## Genestealer Cults Wyrd Powers

Genestealer Cults Adepts are Psykers, drawing their powers from their connection to the distant Patriarch of the wider cult that this gang represents one creeping tendril of. A Cult Adept has access to the Cult Wyrd Power list below as one of their Primary skill sets.

### 1. Telepathy – Hypnosis (Basic)

_With little more than a piercing stare, the Adept can dominate the minds of the weaker-willed._

Select an enemy fighter that is both within 9" and line of sight of the Adept, and that has not been activated this turn. If the Willpower check to perform this action is successful, that fighter may only perform a single Move (Simple) action when activated this round.

### 2. Telepathy – Unbreakable Will (Basic), Continuous Effect

_The Adept channels some measure of the Patriarch’s control over nearby cult members._

Whenever a Nerve or Willpower test is made for another fighter from the gang who is within 9" of the Adept, use the Adept’s Cool or Willpower characteristic value (whichever is appropriate).

### 3. Telepathy – Zealot (Double), Continuous Effect

_The mere presence of the Adept can drive their cult brethren to acts of aggressive hatred._

Once per turn, when another fighter from the same gang that is within 9" of the Adept makes a Fight (Basic) or Charge
(Double) action, any dice that roll a 1 to hit may be re-rolled.

### 4. Telepathy – Mind Control (Basic)

_Twitching and spasming under the control of the Adept, an enemy fighter is forced to slowly raise their weapon and take aim upon one of their friends._

Select an enemy fighter that is within 9" of the Adept. That fighter immediately makes a Shoot (Basic) action, even if they have already activated this round, targeting an eligible fighter from their gang, chosen by the Genestealer Cults player.

:::note

This version of Mind Control is different to the [Mind Control in the expanded list](/docs/the-rules/wyrd-powers#1-mind-control-basic-continuous-effect) from Book of the Outcast. This does not require line of sight. It is also not Continuous Effect.

:::

### 5. Telekinesis – Assail (Basic)

_The Adept uses the force of their will to push enemies from their path._

Immediately make a ranged attack against an enemy fighter within 12" and line of sight. If hit, move the target D3" in any direction – if they were Standing, they become Prone and Pinned after moving. If they come into base contact with a
Standing fighter or any terrain, they stop moving and suffer a Strength 3, Damage 1 hit. If they come into base contact with another fighter, that fighter also suffers a Strength 3, Damage 1 hit and becomes Prone and Pinned.

### 6. Telekinesis – Force Blast (Basic)

Any enemy fighters within 3" of this Psyker are immediately pushed D3+1" directly away. If this movement would push a fighter
from a platform or into a pitfall, stop them at the edge and take an Initiative test for
them. If the test is passed, they are placed Prone at the edge. If the test is failed,
they will fall. If this movement is interrupted by a wall or other impassable terrain,
the fighter is immediately Pinned and takes a hit with a Strength equal to the
number of inches rolled for the push distance.
