<summary>Special Rules</summary>

**Twin-linked:** When a fighter makes a ranged attack with this weapon, they may re-roll any number of the Ammo
dice rolled. However, they must accept the result of the re-roll, even if it is worse.

**Van Saar Protective Gear:** Van Saar fighters are somewhat protected from the effects of their own rad weapons
by their armour and are therefore immune to the effects of the Rad-phage Weapon Trait (i.e., they will not suffer
the additional Flesh Wound).

**Superior Weapons Array:** Rather than making a single Shoot (Basic) action each turn, this fighter may make two
Shoot (Simple) actions per turn. Each action may be made with a different weapon, and each action may target a
different enemy fighter, provided that all of the normal rules for Target Priority are followed.

_Servo-rigs are effectively mechanical exoskeletons, most commonly seen in heavy industry, where workers may be equipped with them to aid with lifting and moving heavy materials or operating large tools or machinery – anywhere where weights not normally manageable by baseline humans must be handled, but where duties cannot readily be entrusted to abhumans or servitors. Where most servo-rigs are worn over the body and limbs, controlled by the wearer’s physical movements and granting themextra strength, servo-rigs are often also utilised to give a worker extra limbs, greatly increasing their dexterity and the range of tasks that can be performed, making what may otherwise be the work of many, the work of a few. Such a rig may be plugged directly into the wearer’s nervous system and controlled directly, or may be automated, forcing a worker to keep up with the pre-programmed movements of the rig into which they are strapped._

_Van Saar makes particular use of such things, in no small part due to the physical deficiencies common within their House. Highly-advanced forms of servo harness, controlled by the wearer’s nervous system or via a direct MIU are common, advanced artisan pieces that put to shame the simple utilitarian forms mass produced and seen in wide use. In battle, it is not uncommon to see Van Saar fighters wearing massive rigs that grant them a huge, spider-like appearance, with many mechanical limbs that greatly increase the combat efficiency of the gang as a whole._
