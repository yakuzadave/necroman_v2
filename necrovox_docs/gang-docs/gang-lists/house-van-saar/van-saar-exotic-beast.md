**Special Rules:** Clamber, Fear Inducing, Fearsome (Ferocity), Horrific.

<details className="">
<summary>Special Rules</summary>

**Clamber:** When this fighter climbs, the vertical distance they move is not halved. In
other words, they always count as climbing up or down a ladder.

**Fear Inducing:** Cyberachnids have the Fearsome (Ferocity) skill and may confer
this onto their owner. The owner only gains this skill provided they have an Active
Cyberachnid within 3", otherwise the skill is lost.

**Fearsome (Ferocity):** If an enemy makes a Charge action that targets this fighter,
they must make a Willpower check before moving. If the check is failed, they cannot
move and their activation ends immediately.

**Horrific:** A Cyberachnid is a horrifying meld of machine and spider that gangers of
other Houses would just as soon not have in their hide-out. A Cyberachnid can never
be Captured.

<summary>Lore</summary>

_Spiders are common to every human-colonised world in the galaxy. Perhaps millennia ago, when Mankind set out to populate the stars, those first ships had onboard stowaways in the form of insects and arachnids, and they were accidentally introduced to new ecosystems. Perhaps they were deliberately introduced to control dangerous insect life on many worlds. Or perhaps they were always there. No one knows for sure, but that spiders can be found almost everywhere humanity thrives is beyond doubt._

_The hives of Necromunda are infamous for their mutant spiders, and many millions of subspecies exist in the dark corners and dusty cracks of the great hives. Some varieties can grow to several feet across, and their presence can make whole domes uninhabitable._

_The spiders of Necromunda mean much to the planet, not least featuring heavily in the heraldry of many clans and ruling families. Yet possibly the most readily-made association is to the House of Van Saar, whose sigil is the likeness of a spider. Van Saar play on this, capturing and breeding large Necromundan arachnids and modifying them cybernetically for many purposes. Van Saar gangs are often accompanied by several such slaved servitor spiders, and their gruesome appearance is often enough to make the faint-hearted maintain what they feel is a safe distance, but in truth is right in the crosshairs, where the Van Saar want themâ€¦_
