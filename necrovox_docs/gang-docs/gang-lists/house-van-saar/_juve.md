**Wargear:** [Armoured bodyglove](/docs/armoury/armour#armoured-bodyglove).  
**Special Rules:** Gang Fighter (Juve), Promotion (Van Saar Specialist), Fast Learner.

<details className="">
<summary>Special Rules</summary>

**Gang Fighter (Juve):** Fighters with this special rule form the backbone of House Van
Saar gangs. The total number of fighters with the Gang Fighter (X) special rule in the
gang must always be equal to, or higher than, the total number of fighters without
the Gang Fighter (X) special rule combined, not counting Hangers-on or Hired Guns.

**Promotion (Van Saar Specialist):** If, during the Downtime phase of a campaign,
this fighter has gained five or more Advancements, this fighter may be promoted to
become a Van Saar Specialist.

When a fighter is promoted in this way, they will from now on count as a Van Saar
Specialist for the purposes of determining which equipment and skill sets they can
access. Their existing characteristics do not change, but they will lose the Gang
Fighter (Juve), Promotion (Van Saar Specialist), and Fast Learner special rules and
gain all the special rules associated with a Van Saar Specialist.

**Fast Learner:** During Campaign play, when this fighter gains a characteristic
Advancement, they do not need to spend an additional 2 XP if
the characteristic being improved has already been improved.
In other words, this fighter may improve a characteristic any
number of times (up to the maximum) for the basic XP cost
shown each time.

_Green Teks are sometimes referred to within the clan as Subteks â€“ though these fighters are very capable, they are yet to be truly tested in battle. While other gangs often treat such lowly members of their crew as cannon fodder, hurling them into a fight with little thought to their survival, the existence of a Subtek is different. This comes down to the value the Van Saar place on all their fighters, and a desire to see them rise in the ranks rather have their lives thrown away._
