_Necromunda is a vast machine and the sons and daughters of House Van Saar are its engineers. While other clans and Noble Houses have been content to embrace the slavish traditions of the Imperium, in particular its superstitious fear of technology, those of House Van Saar have sought to unravel the mysteries of humanity’s lost age of advancement and progress. At times during their long history, their actions have brought them close to tech-heresy, and only the extreme secrecy of their Archeotek cabals and the benevolence of House Helmawr – which benefits most from their innovation – have protected them. This delving into the unknown, however, has taken its toll upon the Van Saar. It is not without good reason that the secrets of the Machine God are sacrosanct to the Adeptus Mechanicus. Those who seek to peek behind the curtain of creation must be ready to pay the price such knowledge brings – and so it was with House Van Saar._

_At the heart of the Clan House is its secret STC, or Standard Template Construct system device. These rare and ancient tools are the most prized of relics to the Adeptus Mechanicus, whose agents and armies are endlessly scouring the galaxy in their quest for these venerated artefacts. Created using long-lost technologies, the STCs were given to colony ships during one of Mankind’s earlier expansions across the stars. Encoded into the imperishable hardware of each machine were the blueprints for all manner of things the colonists might need, from power sources and habitats to armoured vehicles and weapons. In an age during which so much knowledge has been lost to the slow entropy of time, each STC represents a priceless artefact, and in the case of the Van Saar STC, a near infinite source of wealth. It is around this wondrous machine that House Van Saar is built, and it is at once the blessing that affords its members continued existence, and the curse that condemns them to sickness and short lives._
