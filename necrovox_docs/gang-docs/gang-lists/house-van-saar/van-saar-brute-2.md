<summary>Special Rules</summary>

**Van Saar Protective Gear:** Van Saar fighters are somewhat protected from the effects of their own rad
weapons by their armour and are therefore immune to the effects of the Rad-phage Weapon Trait (i.e., they will
not suffer the additional Flesh Wound).

**Superior Weapons Array:** Rather than making a single Shoot (Basic) action each turn, this fighter may make
two Shoot (Simple) actions per turn. Each action may be made with a different weapon, and each action may
target a different enemy fighter, provided that all of the normal rules for Target Priority are followed.

_The Arachnika Ash-jumper is a wasteland variant of the Van Saar Arachni-rig. More heavily armoured and equipped with an array of heavy weapons, Van Saar wasteland gangs and expeditions often use it in place of rigs and runners, especially when operating in dangerous or difficult environments. The Arachnika has proven its worth time and again against enemy vehicles and nomad war parties, the former often caught off-guard by its speed and the latter often unable to smash through its thick plating. Its heavy weaponry is more than the equal of enemy armour â€“ lascannon blasting through the sides of Cargo-8s, plasma guns vaporising enemy fighters and flamers incinerating anything that strays too close. Even its harpoon launcher allows it to drag foes closer or plunder cargo with a well-placed shot, while its ability to take to the air on a plume of ash and flame as its jump boosters kick in, allows it to both leap free of trouble or drop into the midst of its foes unexpectedly. A favoured tactic of Arachnika pilots is to jump from cover up into the low choking cloud cover of the ash wastes, before descending without warning to either carve apart a vehicle with their guns or crush unwary fighters under its metal bulk, before leaping away again into the clouds._
