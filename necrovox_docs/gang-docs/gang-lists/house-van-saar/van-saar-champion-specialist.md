<details className="">
<summary>Special Rules</summary>

**Gang Hierarchy (Champion):** During a battle, once this fighter’s gang has failed a
Bottle test, during any End phase in which this fighter passes its Cool check and
does not flee the battlefield, any friendly Van Saar fighters that are within 6" of this
fighter will automatically pass their Cool check and will not flee the battlefield.
Additionally, during Campaign play this fighter may perform post-battle actions.

**Tools of the Trade:** This fighter enjoys access to a wide variety of weapons. A fighter
with this special rule may take multiple equipment sets.

**Master of Cyberteknika:** The cost of any Cyberteknika purchased for a Van Saar
Archeotek is reduced by half, before rounding up to the nearest 5 credits.

In addition, a Van Saar Archeotek may choose any one
Alpha level item of Cyberteknika to be equipped with when
they are added to the gang. This does not cost any credits
and does not increase the fighter’s credits value.

**Skills:** When recruited, a Van Saar Archeotek may
choose one skill from their Primary skill sets (as
described in the Necromunda Rulebook). This skill
does not cost any XP and does not increase the
fighter’s credits value.
