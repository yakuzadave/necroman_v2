<summary>Special Rules</summary>

**Gang Fighter (Ganger): **Fighters with this special rule form the backbone of House
Van Saar gangs. The total number of fighters with the Gang Fighter (X) special rule in
the gang must always be equal to, or higher than, the total number of fighters without
the Gang Fighter (X) special rule combined, not counting Hangers-on or Hired Guns.

**Promotion (Van Saar Specialist):** When the gang is founded, a single Van Saar Tek
can be promoted to become a Van Saar Specialist. During Campaign play, additional
Van Saar Teks may become Van Saar Specialists by spending Experience (XP), as
described in the campaign rules. A Van Saar Specialist gains the Tools of the Trade
special rule, may purchase Special weapons and Heavy weapons, and may spend XP
to gain additional skills.

**Tools of the Trade (Van Saar Specialist):** This fighter enjoys access to a wide variety
of weapons. A fighter with this special rule may take multiple equipment sets.

_The foot soldiers of the Van Saar clan gangs are the Teks. Despite their humble status in a Clan House filled with technological geniuses and augmented cyber- warriors, a Tek is often better equipped and trained than their rivals from other gangs. The armour built into their survival suit, combined with access to highgrade energy weapons, is only part of this – the remainder being increased intelligence and an education second only to those born in the spire._
