# Ash Wastes Nomads

_Few things in the wastes terrify travellers more than the prospect of encountering one of the Ash Waste Nomads tribes. To the people of Necromunda they are as alien and unsettling as any known xenos species. In the eyes of a hiver they seem divorced from humanity, and though they might appear as humans, there can be no doubt their culture, and perhaps their very biology, diverged from the rest of Mankind’s long ago._

_To those not familiar with the landscapes and peoples of Necromunda, it might seem that upon hearing of these nomad tribes and their wasteland home that they must be little different from the countless other wasters, mutants, scavvies and drudges who have been forced to exist beyond the sheltering embrace of the hive cities. The difference between the two, however, is as stark as the difference between civilisation and barbarism._

#### Special Rules

**Wall Scuttler:** When an Arthromite Duneskuttler climbs, the vertical distance they move is not halved. In other
words, they always count as climbing up or down a ladder.

**Hard to Kill:** Arthromite Duneskuttlers are notoriously hard to kill; when rolling on the Lasting Injury table for an
Arthromite Duneskuttler, roll twice and apply whichever result the controlling player wishes.




#### Lore

_Of the countless insect vermin of the wasteland, few are as feared as the Arthromite Duneskuttlers. Large enough to bite a man’s head off, they stalk though the wastes hiding in the ash dunes waiting to ambush their prey._

_Their fearsome reputation is only aided by the fact they are often used by Nomads as shock troops to charge at the enemy before killing them in a flail of mandibles and scythed limbs. The only ones who seem able to control these hulking insects are large imposing figures, clad in the cast-off carapace of Duneskuttlers and wielding fearsome long polearms._

### Designer’s Commentary: Warrior Spirits

Presented below are the rules for using Ash Waste Nomads Warrior Spirits, allowing you to recreate
the events described in [Apocrypha Necromunda: Halfway Dead](https://www.warhammer-community.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/6RUbYe4baWzeTZ4x.pdf). If the Arbitrator wishes, these new rules may be used in
their campaign.

_Source: Apocrypha Necromunda: Halfway Dead_

:::



Warrior Spirits represent the esoteric beliefs and fighting styles of the Ash Waste Nomads Chieftains and
Watchers. Whether or not these are actual supernatural creatures who aid the outland fighters in battle, or
perhaps merely an aspect of their strange religion manifested through latent psychic abilities, is unknown,
though their effectiveness in battle cannot be denied.

#### Summoning The Spirits

There are six different Warrior Spirits that an Ash Waste Nomads gang can benefit from in an Ash Wastes
battle. In Step 7 of the pre-battle sequence, the Ash Waste Nomads player rolls a number of D6 equal to the
number of Watchers and Chieftains they have in their crew. Compare the result of each dice to the Warrior
Spirit table below to see which Warrior Spirits the gang has available for this battle. Note that multiples of the
same spirit may be generated for each battle if duplicate results are rolled on any of the dice.

#### Using Warrior Spirits In Battle

At the start of an Ash Waste Nomads Chieftain’s or Watcher’s activation, before they perform any actions, they
may choose to benefit from a Warrior Spirit (note that multiple Warrior Spirits cannot be invoked in the same
activation). Choose one of the spirits generated for the battle and immediately apply its effects to the active
fighter. Each Warrior Spirit can only be used once per battle.

#### Warrior Spirits Table

| D6  | Result                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| :-: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  1  | **Styr’ghar (Storm Spirit):** The fighter becomes one with the storm, appearing and vanishing with each rolling cloud front. If the Visibility (X") rule is in effect, the fighter may be moved anywhere on the battlefield at least X" away from any enemy fighters, where X is equal to the distance in the Visibility (X") rule. Their activation then ends.                                                           |
|  2  | **Dae’ghar (Chem Spirit):** Tar-like toxins ooze out of the ground all around the fighter, causing the surface to become sticky and foul, its gritty ash eating through armour and flesh. Place the 5" Blast marker centred under the fighter. Until this round’s End phase, all enemy fighters treat the Blast marker as Dangerous Terrain.                                                                              |
|  3  | **Tyr’ghar (Ash Spirit):** Ashen winds roil around the fighter, choking and blinding their foes, and making it all but impossible for them to land a decisive blow upon their adversary. All enemy fighters within 3" of the fighter must pass an Initiative test or become subject to the Blind condition.                                                                                                               |
|  4  | **Char’ghar (Electro Spirit):** Coruscating electricity surrounds the fighter, as if static from the storm were drawn to them, which they direct into their weapon attacks. For the duration of the fighter’s activation all attacks made by the fighter gain the Shock trait. If they are using a weapon that already has the Shock trait then its effects will trigger on any successful hit roll rather than just a 6. |
|  5  | **Vau’ghar (Fire Spirit):** The fighter harnesses the tormented Fire Spirit of Necromunda, channelling its rage into frenzied attacks. Choose a friendly fighter within 12" (this may be the active fighter). For the duration of that fighter’s next activation (or the current activation if the fighter chose themselves) add 2 to their Attacks characteristic and 1 to any Weapon Skill rolls they make.             |
|  6  | **Myr’ghar (Blade Spirit):** The fighter’s blades become keener, their razor-sharp edges carving through armour, flesh and bone with equal ease. For the duration of their activation, any attacks made by the fighter using a weapon with the Melee or Versatile trait change their AP to -3 unless their AP would be higher, and increase their Damage by 1.                                                            |
