#### Omen of Fortune

While within 3” of its owner, the owner may pass a Willpower test to avoid being hit (once per activation). Make the test immediately after a successful roll to hit has been made against the fighter. The attack counts as missed. Place Templates and Blasts as normal for the purposes of determining hits against other models, but the owner is assumed to have dodged clear.

Omen of Fortune save can only be made once per round.
:::

#### Precognition

- 3+ save (unmodifiable by AP).
- 4+ save (bonus, invulnerable) against Blast/Template only. If successful, this fighter does not count as being hit.

#### Psychic Manifestation

Once per round, the owner can re-roll a failed Willpower test to perform a Wyrd Power (if the owner is a Psyker).

**Skills:** [Clamber](/docs/gang-fighters-and-their-weaponry/skills/#2-clamber).  
**Wargear:** None (always makes unarmed attacks).

A fighter who is turned into a Chaos Spawn is effectively slain and their equipment is lost. They are immediately replaced with a Chaos Spawn. The Spawn is added for free, but the cost affects Gang Rating. Roll a separate D6 for each ? in the profile and consult the table below. This is the Spawn’s characteristics which can't be altered in any way.

| D6  | WS  | S   | T   | W   | I   | A   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1   | 5+  | 3   | 4   | 1   | 5+  | 1   |
| 2-5 | 4+  | 4   | 5   | 2   | 4+  | 2   |
| 6   | 3+  | 5   | 6   | 3   | 3+  | 3   |

- Can only make the following actions: Move, Charge, Fight and Coup de Grace.
  - Can't be, suffer, use or gain any of the following:
  - Pinned.
  - Seriously Injured.
  - Flesh Wounds.
  - Lasting Injuries (if taken Out of Action, it is automatically restrained after the battle).
  - Broken or Insane.
  - Weapons or equipment of any kind (always make unarmed attacks).
  - Experience or Advancements (in any way).
- Automatically:
  - Passes any Cool or Willpower tests.
  - Fails any Leadership or Intelligence tests.

After a battle that featured the Chaos Spawn, nominate up to 3 Gangers (not Out of Action or Seriously Injured at the end of the battle). Roll a D6 for each nominated Ganger: on a 4+, the Chaos Spawn is restrained; otherwise it scurries away to join the other nameless horrors of the Underhive and is removed from the gang. If a dice scores a 1, the Ganger suffers a Lasting Injury roll from the unfettered wrath of the Spawn.

## Gang Composition

Chaos Cults follow standard gang composition, with some additional rules:

- 0-1 Witch.
- Spawns have no impact on Gang Composition.
- In Skirmish battles, 0-2 Chaos Spawns can be purchased.
- When the gang is created, one Helot Cultist can be armed with a Special Weapon. During a campaign, additional Helot Cultists can also take Special Weapons as they are added.

## Special Rules

#### Gaining Experience

Chaos Cults gain experience like normal. Spawns can't gain any Advancements or XP.

#### Loss of a Leader

Nominate a new leader in the following order:

1. Champion
2. Ganger
3. Specialist
4. Otherwise:  
   Use Leadership as first tie-breaker and number of Advancements as second tie-breaker. If there is still a tie, choose one. From now their Type is changed to Leader and count as a Leader for determining which equipment and skill sets they can access. The new Leader gains the Devotion special rule. Their characteristics do not change.

:::note
The Witch can never become the Leader!
:::

#### Special Resources

Settlements generate free Gangers instead of Juves.

#### Injured to Insanity

Demagogue, Witch, Disciple and Spawn never gain Insanity.

#### Campaign

- Outlaw.
- Can hire Chaotic Hive Scum and Bounty Hunters.
- Can suffer Mutations instead of Lasting Injuries.
- Claim Resource Bonuses just like any other gang.
- **Dominion:** Treated as a Cawdor gang for the purposes of gang specific Resource bonuses.

#### Post-battle Actions

- Each Demagogue, Disciple and Witch can make one post-battle action (in the same way as a Leader and Champions).
- The Leader can make a Lead Ritual as a post-battle action (once per post-battle sequence).
- Chaos Cults can't make the Sell to the Guilders action. Captives can instead be sacrificed to perform a Dark Ritual (in a circumstance where they normally could be sold).

| **3-4**        | An opposing gang (roll-off if multi-player) can control that fighter this turn, treating them as part of their gang. Once the turn is over, the fighter no longer counts as part of the opposing gang. |
| **5-6**        | The fighter can act as normal. Once their turn is over, make a Willpower test for them, if it is passed, they regain their sanity and are no longer affected.                                          |
