# Badzone Enforcers

_The Palanite Enforcers keep Lord Helmawr's Peace throughout the underhives of Necromunda, often at the end of a shock baton or boltgun. Being the most overt and visible sign of Lord Helmawr's total dominion over Necromunda, the Palanite Enforcers are rightfully feared wherever they go._

_However, like much on Necromunda, appearances can be deceptive. Out in the badzones of the underhive, regular communication and consistent supply lares are impossible. However, the hive world's inhabitants cannot be allowed to believe they are beyond Helmawr's gaze. This leads to Precinct-Fortresses being set up far from the warmth of the hive's central heat sink. Initially well-supplied and with a full complement of Enforcers, these lone beacons of order are them left to their own devices to maintain the Pax Helmawr as best they can._

_Isolated as they are, Badzone Precinct Captains must abandon many of the restrictions their fellow Enforcers operate under if they are to survive, often abolishing the delineation of their forces between Palanites and Subjugators and even deputising hive scum to bulk out their numbers. Occasionally, an especially promising scum even gets accepted within the Badzone Enforcers' ranks; after all, losses must be replaced somehow. In addition, with limited resupplies of armaments making it through to them, Badzone Enforcers must rely upon whatever they can seize from other badzone elements or trade for on the open markets, with the more specialist equipment ending up in the hands of the Captains and Sergeants alone._

The following section, along with the Palanite Enforcers list, provide all the rules needed top run a Badzone Enforcers gang in your campaigns of Necromunda.
