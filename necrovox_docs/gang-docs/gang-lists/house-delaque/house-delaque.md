# House Delaque

_House Delaque, or the House of Shadow, as it is also commonly known, is one of the more unusual Clan Houses of Necromunda. Unlike the Goliath, Escher, Van Saar and Orlock Houses, that are built upon vital industries and lord their wealth and power over a substantial population of workers, or the Cawdor, who are bound together by faith and claim populations across the hive world as their own, the Delaque have no defined home and no defined industrial role within Necromundan society. If one were to ask a hiver what purpose the Delaque serve for Lord Helmawr, one would doubtless receive myriad answers. Some believe them to be information brokers, who deal in secrets and buy and sell this vital commodity to the highest bidder. Others claim they are afforded their place because of some clandestine deal with the Helmawr line, and that they are spies for the Imperial House, or perhaps one or more of the Noble Houses. Still others claim the Delaque are assassins and saboteurs without peer, and in a world where open warfare between Houses is forbidden, all must enlist their services if they want to advance their power and influence. Like all good lies there is a grain of truth in each of these beliefs. For instance it is true that the Delaque deal in information, and any hiver knows that if you can meet their price a Delaque info-broker can find out what you want to know. It is also true that there is some connection between Lord Helmawr and Delaque, though no one really knows the true nature of this relationship and it ranges from them being the Lord of Necromunda’s eyes and ears below the Wall to the Delaque being a bastard offshoot of the Imperial House itself. House Delaque is also known for the quality of its spies, assassins and saboteurs, though they do not market themselves like mercenaries, and these skills seem more to be a by-product of their true purpose… whatever that is._

## Gang Composition

House Delaque follows the [normal rules](core-gang-creation.md#gang-composition) for Gang Composition.

## Special Rules

Delaque gangs will often include these talented agents, though they do so with the knowledge that the Nacht-Ghul ultimately answer to the Star Chamber and the whispers of the Psychoterica._

**Psychic Scream (Basic)**<br />
Enemy fighters within 3” must pass a Nerve test with a -1 modifier or become Broken.

**Force Blast (Basic)**<br />
Any enemy fighters within 3” are immediately pushed D3+1” directly away. If a fighter is pushed from a platform or into a pitfall, they must pass an Initiative test to be placed Prone at the edge.

If pushed into a wall or other impassable terrain, the fighter is immediately Pinned and takes a hit with a Strength equal to the number of inches rolled for the push distance.

:::note

There has been a new Delaque fighter called a [Spyker](/docs/gangs/gang-additions/hangers-on-and-brutes/hangers-on/#0-2-spyker) that was released in House of Shadows (whereas this was not included). Talk to your Arbitrator if you want to include this earlier version, as they may deem it invalid.

_Piscean Spektors are yet another mystery unique to the Delaque. Most other clans see little distinction between the Delaque Spektor forms and consider them merely another mechanical ally created by the House of Shadow. In truth, the Piscean Spektors are unlike anything else employed by the Delaque and are more akin to a true race in their own right. A cybernetic form wrapped around a harvested xenos brain, the Spektor retains much of its memories from its prior existence, and serves the Clan House in accordance with an ancient pact between humans and its race. While not even the Delaque know for sure where the Pisceans come from, it is believed they are an aquatic race that arrived on Necromunda millennia ago and made their home in its subterranean seas. Occasionally, ancient members of this race come to the Delaque to have their brains placed in machines, the two races sharing a common connection to the Psychoterica._

_In life, a Piscean warrior is a ferocious aquatic alien, shark-headed and inhumanly strong. When its brain is interned in the shell of a Spektor, its connection to the Psychoterica becomes even stronger and it develops psychic powers. While still a competent warrior, favouring savage close quarters combat, its true strength is its ability to channel the Psychoterica into strange and deadly powers. This same ability allows it to float through the air, rapidly climb structures and move with a disturbing grace that belies its cumbersome form. When the Delaque are expecting trouble or staging an important assault, it is often to their Piscean Spektors they will turn, the creations perfectly adapted for combat in the underhive with a truly alien lust for battle._

### 0-3 Cephalopod Spekter (Exotic Beast)

|  M  | WS  | BS  |  S  |  T  |  W  |  I  |  A  | Ld  | Cl  | Wil | Int |

| 5”  | 4+  | 5+  |  3  |  3  |  1  | 3+  |  1  | 7+  | 5+  | 8+  | 4+  |

**Weapons:** Shock stave (same as: shock tendrils).  
**Special Rules:** Flight, Sensor Array, Threat Respose, Watchdog.

#### Flight

Ignores all terrain, moves freely between levels without restriction and can never fall. May not ignore impassable terrain or walls and may not end its movement with its base overlapping an obstacle or the base of another fighter.

#### Sensor Array

If within 3” when the owner makes an Intelligence test (for any reason), roll an extra D6 and pick a dice to discard.

#### Thread Response

When the owner is taken Out of Action, all enemy fighters within D6” of this pet suffer a Strength 1 automatic hit with Seismic (always Pinned, no save roll if the wound roll is a 6 before modifiers).

#### Watchdog

If the owner is a sentry, attackers can be spotted outside the vision arc. Add 1+ modifier to spotting (a 1 before modifiers still fails).

_House Delaque utilises numerous tools to gather secrets and pry knowledge from their surroundings, from scuttling whisper-thieves to burrowing data serpents. Among these, the Cephalopod Spektor is perhaps the most sinister, and the most effective. Each Spektor is a writhing mass of mechanical tentacles and gleaming oculi, its whirring lenses constantly tracking the shadows for movement. Via a complex array of auspexes, the Spektor drinks in its surroundings and communicates them to its owner, granting them a multi-spectral view of the battlefield. The Spektor’s cogitator is built around a fragment of synaptic tissue, grown from its owner’s genetic material. Extracted from a cloned brain gestated to the edge of adulthood, the fragment is interred into the mechanical cranium of the Spektor, and then raised to consciousness by its master. This cognitive bonding also has its drawbacks, however – a Spektor might anticipate its master’s needs, but it also often shares their hatreds or fears, making it act erratically if their owner gives in to rage or panic._

### 0-2 Psychoteric Wyrm (Exotic Beast)

|  M  | WS  | BS  |  S  |  T  |  W  |  I  |  A  | Ld  | Cl  | Wil | Int |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 6”  | 4+  | 6+  |  3  |  3  |  1  | 4+  |  1  | 8+  | 5+  | 6+  | 8+  |

**Weapons:** Flensing knife (same as Ferocious Jaws).  
**Special Rules:** Long Leash, Psychoteric Node, Burrowing.

#### Long Leash

Must try to remain within 12" of the owner (instead of 3").

#### Psychoteric Node

While this pet is Active or Pinned (not Seriously Injured), the owner can channel Wyrd Powers through this fighter:

- The Psyker suffers any Perils of the Warp (as normal).
- Range, distance & LOS is measured from this pet.

#### Burrowing

Move freely under impassable terrain (if movement is sufficient to pass through completely).

_Psychoteric Wyrms are disturbing creations born of dark technology and alien biology. No one save the Delaque know for sure how they are created or what gives them the semblance of life they possess, but the few examples captured by other gangs have yielded no answers – as when a dead wyrm is dissected no mechanisms or organs can be found, only an oily black fluid that reeks like the depths of the sump. In life, however, their abilities are all too terrifying to behold. Wyrms can burrow through all manner of obstacles, from ferrocrete to plasteel, or squeeze their way through the tiniest of openings, as their bodies constrict and segment with unnatural speed. This mobility makes them excellent spies for the Delaque, as there are few places they cannot travel. The connection between a Delaque and Psychoteric Wyrm is similar to that between a Delaque and one of the Spektor creations – the fighter using their `connection to the Psychoteric as well as cranial splicing to exert control over the beast._
