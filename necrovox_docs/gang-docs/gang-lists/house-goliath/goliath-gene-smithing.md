# Goliath Gene-Smithing

_Source: House of Chains_

_Goliaths are unique among the denizens of Necromunda, as they were grown for a purpose, rather than having evolved through chance; that purpose being to work the factories of the hive world. Engineered to be hardy and resilient, as well as strong and stoic, they excel in their task, though the legacy of their creation continues to shape them. Even when the Clan House broke away from its creators and earned its freedom, it took with it this heritage of genetic manipulation. The Goliaths’ gene-smithed past means there remains substantial genetic variance within each clan enclave and gang, each drawing their lineage from a different bio-lab, or Alpha. Some represent the best of their kind, toughest of the tough, and are blessed with the most valuable genetic gifts. While others carry biological missteps, their strength and toughness won at a price to their minds or their longevity. Then there are those that are barely true Goliaths at all, their bodies carrying the weakest of the clan’s genetics, even though their loyalty to the Over-tyrant remains undiminished._

## Using Gene-Smithing

Goliath Gene-smithing is a collection of rules allowing players to further customise their gangs by determining the genetic legacy of their fighters. They provide a huge amount of variety within a Goliath gang, and can be used to create small elite gangs of genetically superior Natborn, flesh-cursed gangs of Vatborn suffering from the biological tampering of their creators, or even gangs of aspiring Unborn who share few of the benefits of the Goliaths but who hope to prove themselves to the clan. Players can also run baseline Goliath gangs without spending any extra credits on Gene-smithing, simply by running gangs of Vatborn without any upgrades.

To use these rules, fighters must choose a sub-type (Natborn, Vatborn or Unborn) when they are added to the gang – Vatborn being the default sub-type. The cost of their sub-type is added to the fighter’s credits cost, as detailed in the House Goliath gang list. Other upgrades are optional, and can be added to fighters using the following guidelines:

- Fighters can only be Gene-smithed when they are added to the gang. Under unusual circumstances the Arbitrator might allow a fighter to be Genesmithed during campaign downtime.
- The fighter can only select Gene-smithing upgrades from those available to their sub-type (as detailed on the Vatborn, Natborn and Unborn tables as follows):
  - Fighters with the Gang fighter (Juve), (Prospect) or (Ganger) special rule can have a maximum of one Gene-smithed upgrade.
  - Fighters with the Gang Hierarchy (Leader) or (Champion) special rule may have a maximum of two Gene-smithed upgrades.

Customise the gang by determining the genetic legacy of the fighters. New fighters added to the gang can be given one of the following origins (affecting cost and gang rating).

## Goliath Sub-Types

| Sub-type |    Cost     |
| :------: | :---------: |
| Vatborn  | +0 credits  |
| Natborn  | +20 credits |
|  Unborn  | +10 credits |

## Characteristic Changes

Some Gene-smithed upgrades either increase or decrease the characteristics of a fighter. After these changes have been made, the fighter’s new profile is considered to be their base profile for the purposes of Maximum Characteristics (see the Necromunda Rulebook). If a fighter has multiple Gene-smithed upgrades that alter their characteristics, then the effects are combined, either adding together or cancelling each other out.

## Vatborn Fighters

Vatborn fighters make up the vast majority of Goliath gangs, and have all the usual gifts and drawbacks of their kind. They are, however, the most mutable of their clan, and have available to them a wide variety of options for genetic tampering, many having been grown for particular environments or purposes. Vatborn fighters have the Baseline Goliath special rule:

### Baseline Goliath

_Even without the genetic manipulation common within the clans, a Goliath is an impressive specimen. Vatborn fighters represent the baseline of the Goliath genetic line, and have no specific benefits or drawbacks._

When added to the gang, Vatborn fighters can choose from any of the Genesmithed upgrades opposite, adjusting the credits cost of the fighter accordingly. Note that some ‘upgrades’ have a negative cost. These represent flaws and deficiencies that weaken the fighter in some way. In these instances, the cost of the upgrade is deducted from the fighter’s base cost as shown in the Goliath gang list.

## Natborn Fighters

Natborn are longer lived and more ‘evolved’ than their genetic cousins from the vat, though the promise of a longer life, and their superior intelligence, makes them less reckless with their existence. They enjoy some of the most potent genetic gifts of all Goliaths representing, as they do, a development of the clan’s genetic heritage from its inception as a slave race. Natborn fighters have the Clever but Cautious and Physical Perfection special rules:

### Clever But Cautious

_The curse of heightened intelligence and a longer life means more incentive to hang on to both._

Natborn alter their starting characteristics by increasing their Intelligence by 2, increasing their Willpower by 1 and decreasing their Cool by 1.

### Physical Perfection

Natborn have the blessing of near-perfect flesh and can build their muscles faster
than any of the other Goliath sub-types. Natborn Leaders, Champions, Prospects,
Juves and Specialists can increase their Strength or Toughness at a cost of 6 XP
rather than 8 XP. When Natborn Gangers gain an Advancement, they can either
roll on the Ganger Advancement table (see the Necromunda Rulebook), or increase
either their Strength or Toughness by 1.

When added to the gang, Natborn fighters can choose from any of the Genesmithed
upgrades below, adjusting the credits cost of the fighter accordingly. Note
that some ‘upgrades’ have a negative cost – this represent flaws and deficiencies
that weaken the fighter in some way. In these instances, the cost of the upgrade
is deducted from the fighter’s base cost as shown in the Goliath gang list.

## Unborn Fighters

As outsiders, Unborn fighters bring a variety of benefits from other parts of
Necromunda to House Goliath. They are also among the hardiest of the clan, often
having survived great pain and peril to be counted as one of the Clan House.
Unborn fighters have the ‘Outsider’ special rule:

### Outsider

_A life before joining the Clan House has given the Unborn a wider experience of Necromunda and its societies than most Goliath ever see._

Unborn fighters can choose to have an additional Primary skill set chosen from:
Agility, Brawn, Combat, Cunning, Ferocity, Shooting or Savant. However, Unborn
fighters may never select skills from the Muscle skill group.

When added to the gang, Unborn fighters can choose from any of the Genesmithed
upgrades below, adjusting the credits cost of the fighter accordingly. Note
that some ‘upgrades’ have a negative cost as they represent flaws and deficiencies
that weaken the fighter in some way. In these instances, the cost of the upgrade
is deducted from the fighter’s base cost as shown in the Goliath gang list

| **Data-Slug Overlay**<br />_Something has gone wrong with the data-slug, its false engrams overlaying this fighter’s own memories, making them prone to flashbacks and bouts of madness._<br />When this fighter activates for the first time in a battle, they must make an Intelligence check. If the check is failed, they become subject to the Insane condition (see the Necromunda Rulebook).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |   -10   |
| **Doc’s Experiment**<br />_While this fighter was under the knife, the doc decided to try an experimental procedure._<br />Select two of the following characteristics: Movement, Strength, Toughness or Wounds. Increase one characteristic by 1 and decrease the other characteristic by 1. You cannot choose a characteristic to decrease if doing so would lower it to 0.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |   +5    |
| **Doc’s Failure**<br />_While this fighter was under the knife, the doc may not have been focused enough on the task at hand..._<br />Select two of the following characteristics: Movement, Strength, Toughness or Wounds. Decrease both by 1. You cannot choose a characteristic to decrease if doing so would lower it to 0.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |   -10   |
| **Genetic Outsider**<br />_An air of distrust surrounds this fighter, no matter how hard they try to prove themselves, other Goliaths are unsettled by their presence._<br />This fighter cannot use the Group Activation (X) special rule. Only a Forge Tyrant (Leader), or Forge Boss (Champion) may take this Gene-smithed upgrade.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |   -5    |
| **Malformed**<br />_Muscle grafts have given this fighter the size and appearance of a Goliath, but all the extra weight makes them ungainly and slow._<br />This fighter increases their Strength characteristic by 1, but reduces their Initiative characteristic by 1.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |   +5    |
| **Proto Goliath**<br />_This fighter has yet to undergo the transformative surgery to become accepted as a Goliath, though they aspire to be part of the clan._<br />Increase the fighter’s Movement by 1, reduce their Strength by 1, reduce their Toughness by 1, reduce their Cool by 2, increase their Intelligence by 2, and increase their Willpower by 1.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |   -10   |
| **Scar Tissue**<br />_Great knots of scar tissue cover this fighter’s body, inuring them to both pain and damage._<br />Reduce the Damage of all hits suffered by this fighter by 1, to a minimum of 1.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |   +10   |
| **Survivor**<br />_This fighter has suffered untold hardship during their life, yet each time death has tried to claim them, they have fought their way back from the abyss._<br />When making Recovery tests for this fighter, they can re-roll one of the Injury dice rolled.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |   +10   |
| **Stimm Implant**<br />_Experimental organs have been implanted in this fighter, feeding a steady stream of chems into their blood._<br />When this fighter activates, they can choose to increase their Strength by 2 until the end of the round. However, if they do they must roll a D6 in the End phase. On a roll of 4+, they will suffer a Flesh Wound.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |   +5    |
| **Two Lives**<br />_Despite being remade into a Goliath, this fighter retains some of the skills from their previous life, memories that can sometimes be dredged to the surface._<br />Whenever this fighter gains a skill as an advancement, or for free during gang creation, randomly generate a second skill from their Primary or Secondary skill sets. Make a note on this fighter’s Fighter card that these two skills are a pair. Whenever this fighter is selected to take part in a battle, one of these skills, determined at random, will be forgotten. To determine which skill is forgotten, assign one skill the numbers 1-3, and the other skill the numbers 4-6, then roll a D6. The number rolled indicates which of the pair of skills is forgotten. |   +5    |

| **Thermal Resistance**<br />_Vatborn Goliaths only_<br />_This fighter has been designed to work the heat of the forges for cycles at a time without breaks and as such their body has been adapted to withstand great heat without damage._<br />Reduce the Strength of any attacks made with the Blaze trait against this fighter by 1, to a minimum of 1.                                                      |   +10   |
| **Enhanced Stamina**<br />_Natborn Goliaths only_<br />_Some Goliaths come from long lines of cargo handlers, and a genetic legacy of hefting large, heavy and cumbersome loads around has left this fighter with the ability to carry far more than even their fellow Goliaths can manage._<br />This fighter may treat weapons marked with a \* as only taking up one of their weapon slots.                    |   +20   |
| **Unique Organ Transplant**<br />_Unborn Goliaths only_<br />_When this fighter was under the knife being transformed into a Goliath, something went wrong and they only survived due to the Doc using specially gene-coded organs that are expensive to maintain or replace._<br />When this fighter suffers a Critical Injury, increase the credit cost of the Medical Escort action for them by D6x10 credits. |   -10   |
