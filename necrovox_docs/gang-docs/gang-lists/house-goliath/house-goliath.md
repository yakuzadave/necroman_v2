# House Goliath

_Source: House of Chains_

_Strength is all for House Goliath. Without the physical strength to dominate rivals or to endure the hardships of Necromunda, a Goliath is nothing. They were created as a slave race to work the refineries and forges of Necromunda and toil in places where even hardy Necromundans could not survive, and while the members of the clan are practically abhuman in their size and strength, only fools underestimate their resourcefulness and low cunning. It was the folly of their creators, who believed the Goliaths could be kept docile and ignorant though genetic meddling, that allowed elements of the clan to gain their independence. Ironically, no sooner had the Goliaths gained their freedom from their creators than they enslaved themselves again through the creation of a savage hierarchy. From among their ranks, the strongest rose to dominate domes and hives, culminating in the ascendance of the Over-tyrant, the lord of all the Goliaths on Necromunda. This overlord holds dominion over the clan via the flow of life-giving stimms – chem cocktails essential to the continued existence of all Goliaths. The clan’s reverence of strength, however, grants the Over-tyrant this right, and while the members of House Goliath once rebelled against outside control, they willingly accept rulership by one of their own._

_Goliaths are unique among the peoples of Necromunda, being on the whole gene-smithed beings, forged from a stable genus of humanity but enhanced for strength and endurance. Whether or not Goliaths are, in fact, abhumans remains a subject of much debate among the representatives of the Adeptus Terra on Necromunda, though the Imperium has deemed them ‘sanctioned’ for use on the hive world under the proviso that Lord Helmawr monitors their development. To date, most Goliaths are still largely created through esoteric biological means – rapidly grown in amneo-vats from flesh-templates and turned out into the refineries and factories for immediate hard labour. These brutish creations are mostly male and mostly sterile, living for less than a decade on a diet of backbreaking work and growth stimms before their bodies fail and they die. Despite this short life-span, Goliaths are born with a baseline knowledge of their world and their position in it, delivered via a cranial data-slug. During the years of slavery, this mnemonic injection was intended to keep the Goliaths ignorant and included only the basest information, keeping them at a learning level akin to a small child or a clever animal. After the Goliaths won their freedom, the Alphas ensured that the data-slug was altered to include the collected knowledge and experience of the Goliaths who had come before. In this way, the Goliaths share the knowledge of the clan gathered over hundreds of generations, giving them a working understanding of everything from hive industries to clan weaponry._

#### Ganger Details

**Restrictions:** None.
**Special Rules:**
* Gang Leader
* Gang Hierarchy (Leader)
* Tools of the Trade
* Group Activation (2)


**Gang Leader:** A House Goliath gang must always include a single fighter with this
special rule:

- A fighter with this special rule may not retire during Campaign play. For a gang
  leader, the only way out is death.
- Should this fighter die during the course of a campaign, or otherwise be removed
  from the gang (for example, if a captured Leader is Sold to the Guilders), another
  fighter must be promoted to replace them (see ‘Death of a Leader’ ).

**Gang Hierarchy (Leader):** During a battle, once this fighter’s gang has failed a
Bottle test, during any End phase in which this fighter passes its Cool check and
does not flee the battlefield, any friendly Goliath fighters that are within 12" of this
fighter will automatically pass their Cool check and will not flee the battlefield.

Additionally, during Campaign play this fighter may perform post-battle actions.
Tools of the Trade: This fighter enjoys access to a wide variety of weapons. A
fighter with this special rule may take multiple equipment sets.

**Group Activation (2):** When a fighter with this special rule is activated, their
controlling player can choose to activate a number of additional Ready friendly
Goliath fighters equal to the number shown in brackets that are within 3" of this
fighter as part of a ‘Group Activation’:

- The controlling player must nominate all of the fighters who will be activated in
  this way before any of them is activated.
- Once all participants of the Group Activation have been nominated, the
  controlling player selects one and activates them as normal, fully resolving
  their activation before selecting and activating the next. Each fighter activates
  individually; groups do not activate simultaneously.

Additional fighters with this special rule activated in this way may not themselves
use this special rule during this activation.

**Skills:** When recruited, a Goliath Forge Tyrant may choose one skill from their
Primary skill sets (as described in the Necromunda Rulebook). This skill does not
cost any XP and does not increase the fighter’s credits value.

##### Lore

_Goliath Forge Tyrants are brutal overseers who rule their gangs with iron-fisted savagery, the nature of the House of Chains demanding nothing less. Should a Forge Tyrant show any sign of weakness it would immediately invite challengers from within the ranks of the gang to dethrone them. For this reason, a Forge Tyrant must always be ready to defend their position and to exert their dominance through raw physical strength. Many Forge Tyrants periodically pick one of their gangers to make an example of, the sound of breaking bones and knuckles hitting meat a good reminder of who is in charge._

#### Lore

_A good Forge Boss knows how to walk the line between being a second-in-command and being the heir to the throne. Forge Tyrants choose their Forge Bosses from those fighters who will challenge their dominance rather than grovel at their feet, as a Goliath is nothing if they cannot test their muscles and prove their physical superiority. It is the ambition of the Forge Boss, therefore, to replace the Forge Tyrant, and everything they do works toward this goal, constantly testing the strength of the leader until such time as they sense weakness, allowing them to assume their rightful place at the top._

**Restrictions:** Pistol, Heavy and Close Combat.  
**Special Rules:** Gang Hierarchy (Champion), Tools of the Trade, Combat Chems Stash.

#### Special Rules
**Gang Hierarchy (Champion):** During a battle, once this fighter’s gang has failed
a Bottle test, during any End phase in which this fighter passes its Cool check and
does not flee the battlefield, any friendly Goliath fighters that are within 6" of this
fighter will automatically pass their Cool check and will not flee the battlefield.
Additionally, during Campaign play this fighter may perform post-battle actions.

**Tools of the Trade:** This fighter enjoys access to a wide variety of weapons. A
fighter with this special rule may take multiple equipment sets.

**Combat Chems Stash:** Whenever this fighter is activated, it may choose to use Combat Chems. Until the End phase of this round this fighter gains an additional +D3 Attacks. However, if the dice roll is a natural 1, the fighter instead suffers a bad reaction and its Attacks characteristic is reduced to 1 until the End phase of this round.

**Skills:** When recruited, a Goliath Stimmer may choose one skill from their Primary
skill sets (as described in the Necromunda Rulebook). This skill does not cost any
XP and does not increase the fighter’s credits value.

#### Lore

_When a ganger rises up through the ranks and gets a taste for chems and violence, they sometimes eschew the path to leadership, instead focusing all their efforts on the mastery of violence in its most brute forms. This is the Stimmer, a combat stimm-driven gang champion who has taken mastery of close combat to the extreme, and is happiest when running screaming at the enemy, guns blazing, or reducing fools to bloody hunks of meat up close and personal._

**Restrictions:** Pistol, Special, Close Combat.  
**Special Rules:** Gang Fighter (Prospect), Tools of the Trade, Promotion (Goliath Forge Boss or Goliath Stimmer), Hot-headed, Fast Learner.


#### Special Rules

**Tools of the Trade:** This fighter enjoys access to a wide variety of weapons. A
fighter with this special rule may take multiple equipment sets.

**Gang Fighter (Prospect):** Fighters with this special rule form the backbone
of House Goliath gangs. The total number of fighters with the Gang Fighter (X)
special rule in the gang must always be equal to, or higher than, the total number of
fighters without the Gang Fighter (X) special rule combined, not counting Hangerson
or Hired Guns.

**Promotion (Goliath Forge Boss or Goliath Stimmer):** If, during the Downtime
phase of a campaign, this fighter has gained five or more Advancements, this
fighter may be promoted to become either a Goliath Forge Boss or a Goliath
Stimmer as the controlling player wishes.

When a fighter is promoted in this way, they will from now on count as either a
Goliath Forge Boss or a Goliath Stimmer for the purposes of determining which
equipment and skill sets they can access. Their existing characteristics do not
change, but they will lose the Promotion (Goliath Forge Boss or Goliath Stimmer),
Hot-headed, Fast Learner and Gang Fighter (Prospect) special rules and gain all
the special rules associated with either a Goliath Forge Boss or a Goliath Stimmer,
as appropriate.

Note that when a fighter is promoted in this way (especially when promoted to
become a Stimmer!), an appropriate model should be used to represent their new
category and type.

**Hot-headed:** Fighters with this special rule have much to prove and often act on
impulse alone, hoping to impress their superiors. Consequently, older and wiser
fighters expect them to be short-lived. Should a fighter with this special rule be
Seriously Injured or be taken Out of Action, friendly fighters that are within 3" do
not have to take a Nerve test, unless they also have this special rule.

**Fast Learner:** During campaign play, when this fighter gains a characteristic
Advancement, they do not need to spend an additional 2 XP if the characteristic
being improved has already been improved. In other words, this fighter may
improve a characteristic any number of times (up to the maximum) for the basic XP
cost shown each time.

#### Lore

_Forge-born are the promising up and comers of the House of Chains. Harvested from a promising batch of Vatborn, or the sons and daughters of a powerful Alpha, they represent the future of the clan. In typical House Goliath fashion, these future gang champions and leaders are not coddled or protected, but rather thrust violently into the world to prove their worth. It is a task the Forge-born take to eagerly, often engaging in the riskiest professions for the clan, or bringing the most dangerous and unpredictable weapons to battle, so they might cause enough carnage to draw the eye of the Alphas and earn thereby their place in the gang._

##### Lore

_Bruisers comprise the bulk of most Goliath gangs. They come from all parts of the clan, and can be Vatborn, Natborn or Unborn, each one drawn to the life of a ganger by the promise of quick creds and brutal violence. That most Bruisers end their days bleeding out in some dismal corner of the underhive doesn’t deter a Goliath, whose life expectancy is usually measured in only a handful of great cycles – if they are lucky!_

_If the life of a Bruiser is short and savage then the life of a Bully is even more so. Bullys join Goliath gangs with none of the combat experience of a Bruiser, often fresh from the forge gangs or slave pits, with only the ambition to break free of their past life driving them on. Some may, in time, rise up to take their place in the gang proper, or even make a name for themselves as a Forge Boss or even a Forge Tyrant. Most, however, don’t survive their first gang fight, sent out by their leaders to soak up bullets and shrapnel and clear the way for more valuable fighters._

_The members of House Goliath are notorious for their gen-hancing and bio- manipulation of their physical forms to monstrous levels. Many Goliath infants are vat-grown, the better to ensure a healthy specimen, whilst others are born of Goliath parents deemed suitable to reproduce for their adherence to the Goliath physical ideal. Whatever the infant’s origin, from an early age House Goliath utilises all manner of artificial assistance to boost its members’ abilities to superhuman levels, be it through the use of combat stimms or other, more esoteric drugs brokered through dealings with House Escher, or the genetic manipulation of their young, up to and including the surgical grafting on of huge volumes of extra muscle mass. There are almost no limits to which the members of House Goliath will not go in their pursuit of what they deem to be the physical ideal. Indeed, this manipulation of their form has gone on for so many centuries that there are those within the Administratum and the Adeptus Mechanicus who believe that many of House Goliath have evolved to become a distinct sub-set of abhuman unique to Necromunda. This is quite alarming considering that gen-hancement and vat-grown muscle grafting is common across the Imperium, and speaks volumes about the levels to which House Goliath has taken these practices._

_Such abuse of growth stimms, surgeries and other methods is not without risks, however, as even the most baseline of Goliaths will show noticeable reductions in cognitive function. For Goliaths that push the limits of their physical form to the extreme, the risks are even greater. Rampant and uncontrollable muscle growth, spontaneous bone spur mutations, metabolisms that rage out of control and total loss of all higher brain functions are common. Such post-human flesh hulks are frequently seen in the gangs of the underhive, where in the crude parlance of the gangs they are called ‘Zerkers’, bringing rampant destruction to the foes of their house._

**Wargear:** Flensing knife (same as ferocious jaws), [mesh armour](/docs/armoury/armour#mesh-armour) (5+, same as: Scaly Hide 2).

#### Counter-charge

Once per round, if all conditions are true:

- Active.
- An enemy charges the owner.

After the enemy movement, interrupt the Activation by performing a Charge (Double) action against the enemy fighter, including the Fight (Basic) action. Finally, the enemy can continue the Charge action and make the attacks as normal (if still Engaged).

_Hive legend has it that many thousands of years ago, during a different age of Necromunda, a now long-extinct type of reptile became the fashion accessory of choice for uphive nobility. Imported as eggs, once hatched these snappy little creatures were seen everywhere for a period of several seasons, kept in fine artificial habitats or carried around in specially-made hand luggage. They became almost common, rapidly…_

_But as they became common, so too did they become big, and with size came increased aggression. Many were culled after accidents led to lost digits, even lost limbs, and in some cases, so the legends go, loss of life. Many more were hurriedly discarded down waste chutes and heat sinks. And so, in the fullness of time, many were found by the denizens of the underhive. Over time, these strange creatures were captured as a new food source, but that practice ended as they were more likely to make food of their human hunters._

_And there their story might have ended in extinction, but for the intervention of House Goliath. For some inexplicable reason, the Goliaths were attracted to these creatures as pets, taking pride in their size and strength, and revelling in their ferocity._

_Today, the Sumpkrocs that House Goliath keep are somewhat different to the original creature, with centuries of genetic cloning causing a few changes and they no longer wholly resemble the creature first imported…_
