# Outcast Mutations

_Source: Apocrypha Necromunda: Devils of Gunk Deep_

_Exposure to the toxic depths of the underhive, or the radioactive badlands of the ash wastes, often warps the bodies of those that call them home. _

Outcast Mutations can be acquired in one of two ways:

- When adding an Underhive Outcasts Hive Scum to a gang led by a Mutant, they may have a single Outcast Mutation purchased at the credit cost indicated on the table below. An Underhive Outcasts Hive Scum may never have more than one Outcast Mutation.
- Underhive Outcasts Leaders and Underhive Outcasts Champions with the Mutant Archetype treat Outcast Mutations as a Primary skill set, this means they can purchase them with XP and can choose one for free when added to the Gang Roster.
