# Goliath Terrain

_Source: House of Chains_

Gangs often make use of terrain in their battles against their rivals. Sometimes this
is whatever is lying around the underhive battlefield, such as barrels for cover or
boltholes from which to launch ambushes. Other times they bring the terrain with
them, setting up fixed weapon platforms, defensive barricades or piles of ammo
crates within easy reach of their fighters.

Goliath gangs can call upon a number of specialist terrain features to include in
their gang. These pieces of terrain are bought from the Trading Post during the
post-battle sequence. Once bought, they are added to the gang’s Stash, and can
be fielded in any battle the gang takes part in unless noted otherwise.

## Placing Gang Terrain

Gang terrain is placed on the battlefield before any fighters are deployed, but after
other terrain has been set up. A gang can place its terrain in its own deployment
area, or, if noted, in no-man's-land (i.e., anywhere outside both their opponent’s
deployment zone and their own deployment zone). Some pieces of terrain (as
noted in their descriptions) can only be used if the gang is the defender in a
scenario with an attacker and a defender.

## Modelling Goliath Terrain

Many of the gang-specific terrain detailed here can be represented by items
from the Necromunda model range. For example, Amneo Canisters can be
represented by Ammo Crates with appropriate gang markings, while Furnace
Barricades can be represented by appropriately-marked Necromunda
barricades. A Heavy Rivet Cannon could be created using a rivet cannon
(such as a spare one from the Goliath gang sprue) fixed to a base. Others,
such as the Pillar of Chains, can be represented by any appropriate marker, or
a girder or pole on a base, hung with chains, while a Relic of the Forge could
be anything from a marker to a suitably impressive piece of industrial terrain,
painted in the colours of the gang and hung with Goliath icons.

## Amneo Canisters

_These contain the vital fluids of the growth vats, and can be used by Goliaths to rapidly heal wounds._

A Goliath fighter within 3" of an Amneo Canister can remove a single Flesh Wound during the End phase of any round.

## Furnace Barricade

_Heavy heat shields can be found throughout Goliath forges. Gangs often turn these thick plates into makeshift barricades where their folded ceramite layers prove especially effective against flamers and melta weaponry._

A Goliath gang can place its Furnace Barricades anywhere in its deployment area or in no-man's-land. A
fighter within 1" of a Furnace Barricade ignores both the Blaze or Melta traits when
suffering hits, provided the barricade is granting them cover against the origin of
the hit.

## Heavy Rivet Cannon

_Rivet guns and cannon are a vital tool of the Goliath factories, the heaviest examples are fixed to tripods or tracked carriages and supplied with an abundance of ammo. Unsurprisingly, gangs turn these tools into weapons, hauling them into position to cover corridors and doorways._

Goliath gangs can only include Heavy Rivet Cannon if they are the defender
in a scenario with an attacker and defender. A Heavy Rivet Cannon uses the
following profile:

## Pillar of Chains (Gang Relic)

_Goliaths often use crude iron spikes hung with chains as a convenient method of securing slaves. Captives are dragged back to the Pillar of Chains, and locked in place for later transportation back to the Goliath enclave._

When a gang with a Pillar of Chains has a chance to capture enemy fighters, it may re-roll one or both of the dice.

## Relic of the Forge (Gang Relic)

_Forge relics are pieces of broken machinery that have been reshaped into a totem pole of clan icons and industrial weaponry. Gangs often use these to mark the boundaries of their territories, the grinning iron faces beaten into their sides a warning to trespassers._

A Relic of the Forge counts as a Gang Relic (see the
Necromunda Rulebook). In addition, Goliath fighters within 3" of a Relic of the Forge
ignore the effects of the Disarm trait and can re-roll failed Ammo checks. Enemy
fighters who end their activation within 3" of a Relic of the Forge must make a
Nerve test (see the Necromunda Rulebook) or become Broken.

Goliath gangs can only include a Relic of the Forge if they are the defender in a
scenario with an attacker and defender.
