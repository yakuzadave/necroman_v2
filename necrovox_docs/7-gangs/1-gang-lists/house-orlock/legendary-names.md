# Orlock Legendary Names

_Source: House of Iron_


An Orlock ganger lives and dies by their reputation,
their fighters following them not just because they are
the toughest underhiver around, but because everyone
knows it. Road Captains, leaders and champions
spend their lives amassing legends about themselves,
some by doing great deeds – with plenty of witnesses
– others by letting their followers talk them up in
drinking holes and wasteland dives. Whether a
legend is true or not, all that matters is that it
takes on a life of its own. Soon people start
referring to the Orlock by their nickname,
which in turn is a self-fulfilling prophecy, as
they strive to live up to it no matter what.

Orlock Legendary Names are special names
that can be given to an Orlock Leader
or Champion, granting them additional
benefits. For example, Orlock Gang Leader
Rothgo Jax, could be given the Legendary
Name ‘Iron Hard’, thus becoming Rothgo
‘Iron Hard’ Jax, and gaining the benefits of
the Iron Hard name. Legendary names are not
without their cost, however, as the flip side of
being a legend is living up to your own hype. Each
Legendary Name comes with a drawback, each of
which is included as part of the Legendary Name’s
special rules.

## Using Legendary Names

Legendary Names are Advancements. They can be
purchased for fighters using Experience points, and
they can be given to characters when they are recruited:

- Any fighter can have up to two Legendary Names.
- Any fighter with the Gang Hierarchy (X) special rule
  can have up to three Legendary Names.

Legendary Names may be taken by fighters as follows:

- Legendary Names can be gained as an Advancement.
  A fighter may be given a random Legendary Name
  (from one of the three categories available) for 3
  XP, or may choose a Legendary Name for a cost of
  6 XP. In both cases, this Advancement increases
  the fighter’s value by 5 credits. If a fighter gains a
  random Legendary Name that they cannot use, simply
  roll again.
- Any fighter with the Gang Hierarchy (X) special rule
  may choose a Legendary Name when they are
  recruited, as well as choosing a skill (as described in
  their profile).

## Unbelievable Escapes

Some fighters are just impossible to kill. The ganger has a reputation for surviving
things no ordinary person should – shrugging off rounds to the chest, stepping out of
the way of incoming fire like they were dodging a punch, or snapping off knives driven
into their gut, before knocking the attacker on their backside.

### 1. Iron Hard

This fighter counts the first Serious Injury or Out of Action
result they suffer during any battle as a Flesh Wound instead. However, if
this fighter is taken Out of Action, their crew will automatically fail the next
Bottle test it is required to make.

### 2. Bullet Dodger

Once per battle, when an enemy fighter makes a ranged
attack that targets this fighter, you can force that enemy fighter to re-roll
all successful to hit rolls made as part of that ranged attack. During this
fighter’s next activation after this ability has been used, they can only
make Move (Simple) actions.

### 3. Badzone Legend

This fighter can make a special 3+ save roll against
any damage sustained as a result of any environmental hazard (i.e.,
damage not originating from an attack by another fighter). During this
fighter’s next activation after this ability has been used, they cannot
initiate or take part in Group Activations.

### 4. Promethium-proof Killer

This fighter ignores all of the effects of the
Blaze trait. However, this fighter cannot benefit from or utilise the Leading
by Example special rule.

### 5. Slippery Scummer

If the fighter is ever captured (see the Necromunda
Rulebook), they can choose to have another fighter from their gang be
captured in their place. If this ability is used and another fighter is taken
captive in this way, then the gang cannot and will not attempt a Rescue
of that fighter.

### 6. Blade Breaker

When this fighter is hit by an attack made by an enemy
fighter using a weapon with either the Melee trait, the Versatile trait, or
both, immediately roll a D6. On a roll of a natural 6, the hit automatically
becomes a miss and the enemy fighter is immediately Disarmed (just as
if they had been hit on a roll of 6 by a weapon with the Disarm trait).

## Impressive Leadership

In the underhive, it takes a big personality to lead a gang, and an even bigger one to
be remembered after you’re on your way to the corpse-starch factorum. Impressive
leaders intimidate those around them, use their guns to make unforgettable
statements and get extra creds just for turning up.

### 1. Bigman

When this fighter makes a Group Activation, they may include
fighters within 6" rather than the usual 3". However, this fighter must
reduce the benefit of any cover they are in by 1 (i.e., while in Full Cover,
enemy fighters only suffer a -1 modifier to their hit rolls when targeting
this fighter, rather than the usual -2).

### 2. Lucky

Once per battle, this fighter can change the result of any
one dice they have rolled to a 6 (you may decide to use this ability
after the dice have been rolled). However, in a battle that uses the
Reinforcement rules, this fighter’s Fighter card must be placed in the
Reinforcement deck.

### 3. Impressive Scars

As long as a friendly fighter has a line of sight to this
fighter, the distance between that fighter and this fighter does not matter
for the purposes of the Leading by Example special rule. However, this
fighter must reduce the number of fighters they can include in a Group
Activation by 1.

### 4. Too Pretty for Primus

If this fighter is still on the battlefield at the
end of a battle, their gang adds 2D6x5 credits to their Stash. However,
if a double is rolled, these credits are added to your opponent’s
Stash instead.

### 5. Iron Stare

Enemy fighters wishing to target this fighter with a ranged
attack must first pass a Cool check if this fighter has a line of sight to that
enemy fighter. In addition, this fighter never counts as the closest fighter
for the purposes of Target Priority.

### 6. Rock Steady

As long as this fighter is Standing and Active, or Standing
and Engaged, you can roll two D6 for Bottle tests and apply the lowest
result. However, if your gang fails its Bottle test, friendly fighters must reroll
a successful Cool check to see if they flee the battlefield.

## Improbable Beat-Downs

Every Orlock has a tale of the time they knocked some underhive killer for six –
some of them are even true! Leaders with legendary reputations about their combat
prowess are said to be able to kill a foe with a single punch or land a bullet between
their enemy’s eyes from the other side of a dome!

### 1. One Punch

When making an unarmed attack (see the Necromunda
Rulebook) this fighter may choose to roll a single Attack dice, irrespective
of their Attacks characteristic or any other bonuses. If this attack hits, it
is resolved at Strength 8 and Damage 2, and no Save roll can be made
(with the exception of Field armour).

### 2. Bullet Lord

Once per battle, rather than rolling the Firepower dice, this
fighter can choose the result of the dice roll to be a 3. However, after
working out the effects of the attack, the fighter’s weapon counts as
having failed an Ammo check.

### 3. Two-guns

When this fighter uses the Twin Guns Blazing rule, after
working out the effect of their attacks, enemy fighters within 6" must
make a Nerve test. However, during any round in which this fighter uses
the Twin Gun Blazing rule they cannot make, or participate in, a Group
Activation.

### 4. Chancer

Whenever this fighter hits an enemy fighter with an Improbable
Shot, they gain D3 XP. When spending Experience on skill Advancements,
this fighter cannot choose skills, and must always gain a randomly
determined new skill instead.

### 5. Headshot

If this fighter takes an enemy fighter Out of Action with their
first Shoot (Basic) action of the battle, they gain D3 XP. However, all
missed ranged attacks made by the fighter count as Stray Shots.

### 6. One Shot

Once per battle this fighter can choose to automatically hit
with a ranged weapon attack, provided the weapon does not have the
Rapid Fire (X) trait or the Blast (X) trait. However, if this fighter can take
a Shoot (Basic) action during their activation they must do so. Note that,
when this fighter uses this ability, they must still roll the Firepower dice.
