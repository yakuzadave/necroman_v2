# Cawdor Terrain

_Source: House of Faith_

Gangs often make use of terrain in their battles against their rivals. Sometimes this
is whatever is lying around the underhive battlefield, such as barrels for cover or
boltholes from which to launch ambushes. Other times they bring the terrain with
them, setting up fixed weapon platforms, defensive barricades or piles of ammo
crates within easy reach of their fighters.

Cawdor gangs can call upon a number of specialist terrain features to include in their
gang. These pieces of terrain are bought from the Trading Post during the post-battle
sequence. Once bought, they are added to the gang’s stash, and can be fielded in
any game the gang plays unless noted otherwise.

## Placing Gang Terrain

Gang terrain is placed on the battlefield before any fighters are deployed. A gang
can place its terrain in its own deployment area, or, if noted, in no-man’s-land (i.e.,
anywhere outside their opponent’s deployment zone and their own deployment
zone). Some pieces of terrain (as noted in their descriptions) can only be used if the
gang is the defender in a scenario with an attacker and a defender.

## Hidden Traps

Some traps are cunningly hidden among the gloom and debris of the underhive,
fighters not knowing if a pile of rubble is just more rubbish or a deadly surprise.
If a trap uses the Hidden Traps rule then it is represented on the battlefield by
not one but six markers. These markers can be tokens, or appropriate terrain
elements on 25mm bases. When preparing these markers, one out of the six is
the real trap (mark its underside, or secretly make a note to determine which one
is real), the others are false traps. When a fighter triggers a trap, as detailed in
the trap’s description, it is revealed. False traps are discarded while the real trap
remains on the battlefield. Note that even when the real trap is revealed, other
false traps remain on the battlefield until they have been interacted with – this is
important if more than one trap is in play, as it will keep the enemy guessing as
to just how many traps remain to be discovered.

## Divine Brazier

The gangs of House Cawdor often daub symbols of the faith on the walls of the
underhive, or bring along icons hammered together from hive scrap to inspire them –
these icons are more often than not on fire. A Divine Brazier can be placed anywhere
in the Cawdor gang’s deployment zone. If the Pitch Black rules are being used then
all fighters within 3" of the Divine Brazier count as revealed. As a simple action, any
fighter may dip a weapon with the Melee or Versatile trait in the brazier, giving the
weapon the Blaze trait until the End phase of the following round.

A Divine Brazier should be represented by a 32mm marker or a piece of terrain
modelled on a 32mm Necromunda base.

## Incendiary Trap

The gangs of House Cawdor often make crude incendiary traps that can douse an
entire area in flame. An Incendiary Trap is a Hidden trap (as described previously)
and has the following profile:

## Hive Incense

As part of their religious rites, House Cawdor gangs often burn holy censers or tapers
of incense – perhaps having seen such rituals being performed by the priests of the
Ministorum. Unlike that august organisation, however, the incense burned by the
Redemption is often far from ‘holy’. Hive Incense may be placed anywhere on the
battlefield that is not within the enemy gang’s deployment zone and not within 6"
of an enemy fighter. Any ranged attack that is made into, out of or across the area
within 3" of the Hive Incense suffers a -1 modifier to the Hit roll.

In addition, all fighters – with the exception of House Cawdor fighters – that start
their activation within 3" of a Hive Incense marker must make a Toughness check as
if they had been hit by a weapon with the Gas trait (allowing them to use the modifier
granted by filter plugs or a respirator, for example). If this check is failed, their first
Move (simple) action must be made in a random direction, as determined by the
Scatter dice.

Hive Incense is represented by a 32mm marker or a piece of terrain modelled on a
32mm Necromunda base.

## Caged Heretic

As a warning to the faithless, House Cawdor gangs will sometimes bring along
heretics, mutants or other unclean prisoners to display to their enemies. Transported
in swaying gibbets, the prisoners are hung over the battlefield, where their piteous
cries act as a reminder to the unworthy as to the price of opposing the Redemption.
A Caged Heretic may be placed anywhere on the battlefield that is not within the
enemy gang’s deployment zone and not within 6" of an enemy fighter. All fighters –
with the exception of House Cawdor fighters – that end their movement within 6" of a
Caged Heretic must make a Nerve test.

Caged Heretics cannot be targeted by shooting (it is assumed they cower in their
cages if shot at), though if they are caught under a Blast marker or template roll a D6
– on a 3+ they are unaffected, otherwise they are destroyed and removed from the
battlefield. Enemy fighters may also attempt to free the Caged Heretic by performing
a Double action while in base contact with the Caged Heretic and making a Strength
or Intelligence check. If the check is passed, remove the Caged Heretic from the
battlefield and the fighter that freed them gains D3 XP.

A Caged Heretic is represented by a 32mm marker or a piece of terrain modelled on
a 32mm Necromunda base.

## Holy Gang-Relic

Holy Gang-Relics are sacred objects that hold great significance to the Redemption.
It might be a battered autopistol (now long broken) that was once wielded by a
great ‘saint’ of the clan, or perhaps a shattered fragment of armour that in a certain
light looks like the face of the God-Emperor (or at least how the followers of the
Redemption believe his face to look). A Holy Gang-Relic counts as a Gang Relic (see
the Necromunda Rulebook). In addition, Cawdor fighters within 6" of a Holy Gang-
Relic are filled with a fervent zeal as they attempt to protect the object, and may
apply a +1 modifier to both their Hit and Wound rolls.

Cawdor gangs can only include a Holy Gang-Relic if they are the defender in a
scenario with an attacker and defender.

A Holy Gang-Relic can be represented by a 40mm marker or a piece of terrain
modelled on a 40mm Necromunda base.

If an enemy fighter is able to get within 1" of a Holy Gang-Relic, they can make a
Defile Relic (Double) action. Once a Holy Gang-Relic has been defiled, it loses its
special rules and cannot be defiled again. In a campaign, a fighter who defiles a Holy
Gang-Relic gains D3 XP.
