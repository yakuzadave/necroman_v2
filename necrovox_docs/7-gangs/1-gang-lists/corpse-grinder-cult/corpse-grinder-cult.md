# Corpse Grinder Cult

_A cannibal sickness lurks at the heart of Necromunda, like a festering wound that will never heal. It is the great cycle of existence that rules over all who serve the Imperial House, the denizens of the hives either feeding on their predecessors, or feeding the living with their own dead flesh. Corpse Grinder Cults are a by-product of this brutal necessity, charged with the grim task of recycling their fellow hivers into corpse-starch. The Great Houses of Necromunda are intimately familiar with the Corpse Grinder Cults, for they are a plague that rises from within the mortuary combines and Corpse Guilds with regular frequency. Even in the unrelenting horror of the hive, those forced to recycle corpses sometimes rebel against reality, losing their sanity among the whirr of the meat-saw and wet crunch of the bone-grinders. Where once a creature of reason and temperance stood, now a hollow shell consumed by hunger remains – the perfect vessel for the corrupting touch of Chaos to infect._

_Corpse Grinder Cults often start within the hallowed ranks of the Corpse Guilds. From among the toiling workers a leader will arise. Whether these deranged individuals draw the gaze of the Blood God with their cannibal madness or if it is the influence of the Dark God who turns honest men to feast upon the cutting floor is unclear. The result, however, is the same. Over time, a cult leader will become stronger and more ravenous, the growling voice of Khorne driving them to murder so that they might feast upon warmand bloody flesh. Around these debased leaders, deviant cults are formed. Prospective followers might be drawn from within the mortuary manufactorums, or from the greater hive populace. At first trusted members are inducted, and offered a taste of the gory bounty smuggled out of production lines. Thus are entire families and hab communities corrupted, most knowing only that the meat gives them strength and endurance like nothing they have known, unaware of the dark blessing surrounding the cult leader._

## Gang Composition

A Corpse Grinder Cult gang must follow these rules
when it is founded and when new fighters are added
to the gang:

- There must be one Leader (Butcher) chosen when
  the gang is first founded.
- The total number of Initiates in the gang must
  always be equal to, or higher than, the number of
  other Skinners in the gang.
- The gang may only ever include a maximum of 0-3
  Champions (Cutters) at any time.
- A fighter can be equipped with a maximum of three
  weapons. Weapons marked with an asterisk (\*) take
  up the space of two weapons.
- Any fighter may take Wargear.
- Weapon accessories marked with a dagger (†) may
  not be combined together on the same weapon. If one such accessory is purchased for a weapon,
  another may not be added.

During an Uprising Campaign, gangs continue to
follow the above rules as new fighters are added to
the gang. Additionally, the following rules apply:

- During the course of an Uprising Campaign, any
  fresh recruits added to the gang may be equipped
  with items currently held in the gang’s Stash, rather
  than purchasing new equipment.
- During the course of the campaign, gangs may
  gain new equipment, either by purchasing it from
  the gang’s House Equipment List or as a result of
  Scavenging. These items are added to the gang’s
  Stash and may be distributed among fighters during
  any post-battle sequence:
  - A fighter cannot be given a new weapon of a type
    not allowed by their entry within their House List.
  - Leaders and Champions can be given additional
    weapons, but if they have more than three
    weapons, they will have to fill out multiple
    Fighter cards, each representing a different ‘set’ of equipment.
  - A fighter may discard any Wargear carried when
    given new Wargear. Discarded Wargear is placed
    in the gang’s Stash.

## Special Rules

In a Dominion Campaign, Corpse Grinder Cult
gangs are treated just like any other; they begin the
campaign with a Settlement Territory which they
cannot lose, representing their base of operations. They can take control of unoccupied Territories during
the Occupation phase and they can seize control
of Territories from other gangs during the Takeover
phase.

Settlement Territories do not generate Juves;
instead, each D6 roll of a 6 generates a free Initiate. If
both of the D6s roll a 6, this becomes a single Skinner.

Despite their secret agenda, a Corpse Grinder Cult
gang is seen as just another gang by most of the
locals. They claim Territory Boons just like any other
gang. Additionally, a Corpse Grinder Cult gang gains
Enhanced Boons for a Corpse Farm Territory as if they
were a Cawdor gang and from a Fighting Pit Territory
as if they were a Goliath gang.

### Outlaw

A Corpse Grinder Cult gang is automatically an [Outlaw gang](/docs/founding-a-gang/gang-creation#outlaw-gangs).

### Agents Of Misrule

In a Law and Misrule Campaign, Corpse Grinder Cult gangs start aligned to Misrule. They cannot change their alignment over the course of the campaign.

### Blessed by the Lord of Skin and Sinew

:::note Designer's Commentary

Presented below are special rules that will allow you to recreate the events described in Sump City Sinking. If the Arbitrator wishes, these rules can be used by any Delaque gang during a campaign.

:::

When a Corpse Grinder Cult fighter with the Gang Hierarchy (X) special rule is activated, their controlling player may attempt to Invoke the Dark Gods before performing any actions.

**Invoke the Dark Gods:** This fighter makes a Willpower test, with a +3 modifier if they took an enemy fighter Out of Action in their previous activation. If the test is failed, roll an Injury dice apply the result immediately to this fighter. If the test is passed, the fighter gains the following benefits for the duration of this activation:

- +1 to their Strength, Toughness and Attacks characteristics.
- Roll a D6 at the end of their activation. On a result of a 4+, they can remove a single Flesh Wound or recover a single lost Wound.
