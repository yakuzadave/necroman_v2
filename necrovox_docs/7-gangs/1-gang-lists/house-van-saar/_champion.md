**Skills:** 1 Primary (custom).

**Special Rules:** Gang Hierarchy (Champion), Tools of the Trade, Group Activation (1).

<details className="">
<summary>Special Rules</summary>

**Gang Hierarchy (Champion):** During a battle, once this fighter’s gang has failed a
Bottle test, during any End phase in which this fighter passes its Cool check and
does not flee the battlefield, any friendly Van Saar fighters that are within 6" of this
fighter will automatically pass their Cool check and will not flee the battlefield.

Additionally, during Campaign play this fighter may perform post-battle actions.

**Tools of the Trade:** This fighter enjoys access to a wide variety of weapons. A fighter
with this special rule may take multiple equipment sets.

**Group Activation (1):** When a fighter with this special rule is activated, their
controlling player can choose to activate a number of additional Ready friendly Van
Saar fighters equal to the number shown in brackets that are within 3" of this fighter
as part of a ‘Group Activation’:

- The controlling player must nominate all of the fighters who will be activated in this
  way before any of them is activated.
- Once all participants of the Group Activation have been nominated, the controlling
  player selects one and activates them as normal, fully resolving their activation
  before selecting and activating the next. Each fighter activates individually; groups
  do not activate simultaneously.

Additional fighters with this special rule activated in this way may not themselves use
this special rule during this activation.

**Skills:** When recruited, a Van Saar Augmek may choose one skill from their Primary skill sets (as described in the Necromunda Rulebook). This skill does not cost any XP and does not increase the fighter’s credits value.

_Second to the Primes are the Augmeks. Only slightly less dangerous in battle, they are well versed in countless forms of technological warfare and advanced wargear forms. Often they will act as the gang’s ‘heavies’, lugging massive weapons into battle, giving their Prime access to unrivalled firepower. Augmeks also stand ready to take up the leadership role should their Prime fall, allowing the Van Saar gang to transition swiftly from one commander to another without any loss of combat effectiveness._
