# Van Saar Archaeo-Cyberteknika

_Source: House of Artifice_

House Van Saar has a well-deserved reputation for
tech, and bionics in particular, their artisans providing
augmetics for many of the Great Houses, as well the
Merchant Guild, powerful criminals, and anyone else
who can pay their high prices. This mastery of the
cybernetic comes not solely from a desire to bring
wealth to the Clan House, but out of a necessity
to preserve the failing flesh of its people. By
the time a Van Saar clanner comes of age,
their body will already be starting to fail
them, kept alive only by the systems of their
survival suits. As they age, or are wounded
in the endless wars of the underhive, their
body will degrade further, and only the
intervention of augmetics can keep them
going. Fortunately for a Van Saar ganger,
access to the clan’s Cyberteknika (as it is
known within the Clan House) is plentiful,
and a successful fighter can greatly extend
their own life span, enhance their abilities
and hide their inward degeneration through
the use of masterfully wrought artificial skin
and limbs.

## Using Archaeo-Cyberteknika

All Van Saar fighters have access to Cyberteknika,
and as they gain advances or suffer injuries they can
use Cyberteknika to repair and enhance themselves.
There are a few ways for a fighter to gain a piece of
Cyberteknika – either to repair a Lasting Injury, once
they have spent Experience points for an advancement
(representing the fighter’s body aging) or during gang
creation (reflecting the older, more experienced,
members of the gang).

To repair a Lasting Injury, during any post-battle
sequence, the player simply pays the credits cost for
the Cyberteknika associated with the injury (Eyes,
Hands, etc) and places the fighter Into Recovery.
Once the fighter leaves Recovery, the effects of the
Injury will have been replaced with the effects of
the Cyberteknika.

Alternatively, when a fighter gains a new advance, they
may also replace any of their body parts with a piece
of the Cyberteknika, paying the credits cost and going
Into Recovery as above.

Finally, Van Saar fighters with the Gang Hierarchy (X)
special rule may be given Cyberteknika during gang
creation at the cost listed as follows.

## Upgrading Archaeo-Cyberteknika

Once a fighter has a piece of Cyberteknika, it is permanent. Cyberteknika can be
used to replace any Bionics (as found in the Trading Post) in the location it is taken
(Eyes, Hands, etc), and a fighter can only have one type of Cyberteknika in each
location on their body. All Cyberteknika comes in three levels, ranked Alpha (the
most basic), Gamma (intermediate), and Omega (the most advanced). When a
fighter gains a piece of Cyberteknika, they can choose any level provided they can
pay its cost in credits.

Fighters can also upgrade their Cyberteknika – this is the only instance in which they
can change the type of Cyberteknika they have. To upgrade a piece of Cyberteknika
the fighter must pay the difference between the cost of the level they have and the
next level up, after which they will go into Recovery. Once the fighter leaves Recovery,
they gain the improved piece of Cyberteknika (i.e., Alpha becomes Gamma and
Gamma becomes Omega). Omega Cyberteknika cannot be upgraded.

## Damaged Archaeo-Cyberteknika

If a fighter with Cyberteknika suffers a Lasting Injury to a location with Cyberteknika,
roll a D6. On a 4+ the Lasting Injury itself is ignored, though the fighter must still
go into Recovery. Otherwise the Cyberteknika is damaged and stops working (the
fighter can no longer use its benefits), and the fighter then goes into Recovery. Note,
however, that none of the other effects of the Lasting Injury are applied against the
fighter.

To repair a piece of Cyberteknika the fighter must pay half its cost in credits during
the pre-battle sequence of any battle, or during downtime in a Campaign.

:::note MODELLING ARCHAEO-CYBERTEKNIKA

The bionics used by the Van Saar, while functionally
very similar to those employed by the majority of
Necromundans, are of exceptional quality. Quite
often they will be indistinguishable from human
limbs, especially if concealed under their survival
suits, and to the untrained eye a Van Saar fighter
might appear completely natural – even if they
are anything but. With this in mind, players should
feel free to add Cyberteknika to their Necromunda models without the need to convert them – it can be
imagined that the fighter’s enhancements are hidden
under their suit or appear identical to the real thing.
That said, if a player wants to represent bionic limbs,
eyes and other augments (perhaps raiding other kits
from the Citadel Miniatures range for parts) then
they should be able to do so, for not all Van Saar
fighters favour subtlety, and many wear their bionics
out in the open for all to see.
