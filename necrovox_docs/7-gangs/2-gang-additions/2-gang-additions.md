# Gang Additions

Outside of your core gang list, there are a number of additional fighters that can be added to your gang. Many come with additional benefits, and come with drawbacks as well!

These can be divided into two groups:

**1. Persistent**

- Exotic Beasts
- Brutes
- Handers-on
- Vehicles & Crew

**2. Temporary**

- Hired Guns
- Alliances

Persistent additions are added as part of the growth and expansion of your gang. Temporary additions are treated more as a balancing mechanism (although alliances can be used as the foundation of a gang in their own right).
