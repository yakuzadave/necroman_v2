# Alliances

Clan House gangs are given great freedom when it comes to furthering the interests of their House, and
in the underhive operate about as independently as any group of people on Necromunda can. However, even a gang sometimes needs friends, access to extra ordnance or a little official clout to get the job done. In these instances a gang might make a temporary alliance with locals, Enforcers, Guilders or some other
faction, donning the veneer of officialdom while it
aligns with their interests. Such alliances rarely last
for long, as once the gang has achieved its goal,
independence becomes more important than the
support they were offered.
For their part, both Guilders and other sanctioned
groups regard gangs as temporary tools to be used
when it suits, but are never fully trusted.

The Alliance rules represent a short-term alliance
between a player’s gang and a body such as a
Guild, a criminal organisation or a Noble House. The benefits of having an Alliance depend on the
ally, but can mean access to cheaper weapons and
Wargear, bonuses when playing certain scenarios or
special Hired Guns who will join the gang while the
Alliance lasts.

Alliances also come with drawbacks. These can
include the allies taking a cut of the rewards from a
scenario, gangs being forced to play certain scenarios
favourable to their allies, or their opponents getting
help from the allies’ enemies.

:::note Designer's Note: Using Alliances

Alliances are optional rules that can be included in a
campaign at the discretion of the Arbitrator. While it
is possible to use the rules for Alliances in Skirmish
play, provided both players agree, they really come
into their own when used over several games – meaning players must take both the good (cheaper
weapons, special Hired Guns) with the bad (having
to play certain scenarios or giving up some of their
scenario rewards).

Players and Arbitrators are encouraged to keep
track of Alliances as they can really help build an
exciting narrative over the course of a campaign,
with certain allies refusing to work with a gang
based on their past history, or gangs developing
rivalries depending on the allies they have chosen
to back. Arbitrators could even require all gangs
to make Alliances for their campaign, forcing themto choose sides in a larger confrontation between
Guilders, Enforcers, recidivists or seditious cults!

:::

## Making an Alliance

Alliances are not to be entered into lightly. Once a gang
has pledged its support to an ally, you can be sure their
new friends will force them to stick with it – at least
until the ally gets some results or they decide the gang
has become a liability.

Follow these steps to make an Alliance:

1. Any gang can decide to enter into an Alliance at
   the beginning of a campaign, or before any battle
   in a campaign, provided they do not already have
   an ally.
2. Choose an ally from those on offer, both in this
   supplement or from another supplement. Note
   that the allies presented in this supplement
   represent those that House Van Saar has a long
   history of collaboration with, meaning that House
   Van Saar gangs can make a Strong Alliance
   with these. Making an Alliance with an ally from
   another supplement is possible, but the Alliance
   may prove to be weaker.
3. Once a gang has made an Alliance it will last until
   the end of the current phase of the campaign, or
   until either they or their ally break it as a result
   of their actions. If a gang breaks their Alliance
   before the end of the current Campaign phase
   then they cannot gain another until the following
   phase unless their Arbitrator decides otherwise.
4. While part of an Alliance, a gang may not use
   any Sub-plots or roll on any of the House Favours
   tables.
5. Unless otherwise noted, a gang can never have
   more than one ally at a time. A gang should make
   a note of their ally on their gang roster, along with
   any benefits and drawbacks which the ally brings.

### Benefits And Drawbacks

Each Alliance brings with it a set of Benefits and
Drawbacks. These are special rules that will apply
to the gang for the duration of the alliance and can
include things such as access to certain equipment,
special Hired Guns or having to play certain scenarios
when given the option. The exact details of an
ally’s Benefits and Drawbacks can be found in their
individual descriptions, along with guidelines on how,
and when, they come into play.

### Testing The Alliance

Sometimes the strength of an Alliance might be tested.
This is usually because of something the gang has
done or wants to do, or because the ally wants to exert
their will upon the gang and the gang wants to resist.
This is known as Testing the Alliance, and applies to
the use of some Benefits and Drawbacks.

When an action requires the alliance to be tested, it
will be noted in the ally’s description. When Testing the
Alliance the gang must roll a D6 on the table below,
adding 1 to the result for each time their alliance has
already been tested during this Campaign week:

#### Testing the Alliance Table

| &nbsp;&nbsp;D6&nbsp;&nbsp; | Result                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| :------------------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|            1-4             | **Disquiet:** The ally is not happy with the gang’s actions but continues to hold up their end of the Alliance… at least for now.                                                                                                              |
|            5-6             | **Warning:** The ally issues a warning to the gang, who must work to restore their good faith. During the next battle the gang takes part in, it does not gain any of the Benefits of the Alliance, though must still adhere to its Drawbacks. |
|             7+             | **Broken:** The Alliance is broken. The ally leaves the gang and the gang may not enter into an Alliance with another ally until the next phase of the campaign.                                                                               |

<!--
- Enter into an Alliance from the start or before any battle (provided they do not already have an ally).
- Max 1 at a time (unless otherwise noted).
- Lasts until the end of the campaign phase, or until either part breaks it.

## Alignent (Law Abiding and Outlaw)

There are 3 types of alliances available, depending on the gang’s alignment:

- **Guild:** Law Abiding only.
- **Recidivists:** Outlaw only.
- **Noble:** Any.

## Limitations

While allied, a gang can't use:

- Favours.
- Sub-plots (House or Intrigue).

## Joining the Battle

Any Alliance can join the gang in any battle. This is done in one of two ways:

- Always available (no test required).
- Aid (pass the Aid test to join).

Some alliances (including all Guilds) will specify Aid and a Success Level.

### Aid

Each Alliance that requires an Aid test will specify a Success Level.

| Alliance   | Success Level | Alliance Representatives        |
| :--------- | :------------ | :------------------------------ |
| Water      | 10 or less    | Nauthican Syphoning Delegation  |
| Promethium | 11 or less    | Pyromantic Conclave             |
| Corpse     | 9 or less     | Corpse Harvesting Party         |
| Slave      | 10 or less    | Slave Entourage                 |
| Coin       | 11 or less    | Toll Collectors                 |
| Iron       | 9 or less     | Wandering Scum (D3+2 Hive Scum) |
| Ran Lo     | 11 or less    | Auditing Conclave               |

In the pre-battle sequence, the gang may attempt to add the allied Representatives to the battle.

Aid roll: D6 + Reputation

- Equal to or less than the Success Level:
  Successful, the allies deigns to aid their allies on the battlefield.
- Greater than the Success Level:
  Failed, the allies decide that the gang can cope alone.

## Representatives

Alliance Representatives consist of 1-5 fighters. They are always fielded together and must operate together, meaning that a crew must contain all or none.

- “Here to Help”: Joins the battle in addition to the standard crew, regardless of method (random/custom). This may effectively allowing 1-5 more fighters than normally allowed.
- If included, joins the gang’s crew regardless of crew selection method (random/custom).
- Free to hire (does not affect Gang Rating).
- Standard abilities for Leaders and Champions:
- Leader:
  - Group Activation (2)
  - Leading By Example (12”)
- Champion:
  - Group Activation (1)
  - Leading By Example (6”)

#### A Band Apart

- Counts as a separate gang (Faction) for the purpose of Overseer, Group Activation and Leading by Example.
- Treated as part of the allied gang in every other respect.
- Ignore Lasting Injury rolls, automatically treated as Out Cold (when going Out of Action).

All Bodyguards have the following special rules:

#### Bodyguard (Leader)

If the specified fighter type is within 2” and hit by a ranged attack, the hit and all its effects can be transferred to this fighter.

#### Indentured Fighters

If only the Bodyguards remain on the battlefield, and the rest of the Alliance Representatives are removed for whatever reason, they count as having failed a Bottle test (regardless of how many fighters in total have been removed from the battle).

## Test-trigger

Many drawbacks will include various test-triggers. These are common ways an alliance can be tested (and possibly broken).

The test-trigger normally consists of 2 parts (Cause & Effect):

- **Cause:** A situation that causes a consequence.
- **Effect:** A consequence of the cause. This is the ‘price’ the gang must ‘pay’.

Example: Test-trigger: Cause. → Effect.

When the cause occurs, the gang has 2 options:

- Pay the consequence (effect).
- Test the Alliance.

Test-triggers with a cause & effect means that the gang can always choose to Test the Alliance to avoid the effect.

## Testing the Alliance

When Testing the Alliance, roll a D6 and apply modifiers.

- +1 for each previous time this test was made (during this campaign cycle).
- +3 when changing alignment (Law Abiding/Outlaw).

| &nbsp;&nbsp;D6&nbsp;&nbsp; | Result                                                                                                                                                    |
| :------------------------: | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|          **1-4**           | Disquiet: No effect (not happy with the gang’s actions, but continues to hold up their end of the Alliance… at least for now).                            |
|          **5-6**           | Warning: For the next battle, no Benefits are gained, but drawbacks still apply (a warning is issued and the gang must work to restore their good faith). |
|           **7+**           | Broken: The Alliance is broken.                                                                                                                           |

## Strong Alliance

Some House gangs can form a Strong Alliance. Automatically apply Disquiet (1-4) the first time the alliance is tested.

| Alliance           | Type       | Alignment   | Strong Alliance |

## Ratings

All alliances and included delegation fighters have ratings (mainly used by Outcast gangs):

| Alliance           | Alignment   | Strong Alliance | Representatives               | Gangers                   | Champions                  | Leader  | Cost |
