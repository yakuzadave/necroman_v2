# House Catallus

_Source: House of Artifice_

_Among the Noble Houses, Catallus is known as the House of Masks. Brokers of diplomacy and deals, they are the matchmakers and social overseers of Necromunda, facilitating the connections between the Great Houses and off-world organisations through their agents. Some Houses look down upon them, considering them little more than middlemen in the great workings of the nobility, but without their expertise at bringing people together and mediating deals, little would get done. They are also one of the most mysterious of the Great Houses, and its nobles never venture forth from their chambers without their traditional carnival masks firmly in place. This is all part of the mystery that House Catallus cultivates in its dealings with the rest of Necromunda, and while there is a complex and subtle pattern to the shape, design and expressions of their masks – the meaning of which remains largely known only to the Great House itself – members of House Catallus are often considered a single entity by outsiders. The masks, and the anonymity they bring, are all part of the power of the Noble House, who believe in the Invisible Truth – a philosophy that teaches that the only way to endure the unendurable brutality of their world is to not exist at all. After all, how can a lord, lady or family be extinguished from history if they never lived in the first place?_

_Over its long history, House Catallus has taken many forms, and as the political winds of Necromunda have changed so too have the masters of the Noble House changed with them in their pursuit of the Invisible Truth. There is an old saying within the spire: ‘Catallus turns from friend to foe like the hands of the Great Clock, and just as regularly’. At one time or another the Noble House has been close allies or hated enemies of almost every House and clan on the hive world, including the Imperial House, and history records their hand in many of the great wars and disasters to have befallen Necromunda. The only constant in this long history of broken alliances has been the Noble House’s connection to House Van Saar. For a reason perhaps known only to Duke Otto XXIInd and the Faceless Lord – the honorary title given to the head of House Catallus – there is an unbreakable bond between the House of Artifice and the House of Masks. Some have speculated that it is the Van Saar who engineer the sophisticated carnival masks worn by the nobles of Catallus, others claim that House Catallus knows some dark secret about Van Saar, such as where all their wondrous technology is manufactured. Whatever the reason, the two are often seen working together._

## Benefits

**Noble Intrigues:** Any gang may form an Alliance with
House Catallus. In addition, House Catallus does not
care if a gang is Law Abiding or Outlaw – what matters
is that the Alliance benefits House Catallus!

**Strong Alliance (House Van Saar):** The first time a
gang belonging to House Van Saar is required to Test
the Alliance (see page 75) with this ally, do not roll.
Instead count the result as Disquiet.

**Faceless Allies:** House Catallus excels at making
people disappear from Imperial records, or covering up
their misdeeds. When attempting to sell to the Guilders
any Captive fighter taken from a gang that is allied to
House Catallus, enemy gangs gain no bounty (though
they may still sell the fighter, effectively removing them
from the campaign).

In addition, once each Campaign week, if a gang
allied to House Catallus would be declared Outlaw for
any reason, they may choose to ignore this change in
alignment and remain a Law Abiding gang, though the
gang must then Test the Alliance immediately.

**Carnival of Death:** During the pre-battle sequence, the gang may add a [House Catallus Carnival](#house-catallus-carnival) to their gang. If the gang is facing an enemy crew with any fighter worth 250 credits or more, they must include a House Catallus Carnival, unless they choose to Test the Alliance instead.

## Drawbacks

**Debts to be Paid:** During the post-battle sequence of
any battle in which a House Catallus Carnival took part,
and if the gang contains any fighters with the Gang
Fighter (Juve) special rule, roll a D6 for each. On a roll
of 1, the House demands that fighter be turned over
to serve as a Mindfrayed. The fighter and all of their
weapons and Wargear are immediately deleted from
the gang roster. The gang may choose to ignore this roll
and keep all of its fighters, but if they do they must Test
the Alliance.

**The Invisible Truth:** Once a gang has made an alliance
with House Catallus, make a note on the gang’s roster
and do not delete this note even if the alliance is later
broken. From this point onwards, should the gang ever
attempt to form an alliance (with any organisation),
roll a D6. On a result of 1, the gang immediately forms
a new alliance with House Catallus instead of the
alliance they were about to form.

## House Catallus Carnival

_A House Catallus Carnival is a strange collection of individuals, even by the standards of Necromunda. Like dancers gathering for a performance, a Carnival arrives for its audience – usually someone who has drawn the ire of the Great House – before launching into a display of horrific violence and bloodshed. A Carnival can include any number of individuals, sometimes dozens of masked murderers gathering to do the work of House Catallus, other times only a handful or even one masked individual appearing from the crowd. In all cases, however, a Carnival is led by a Masked Killer – a nobleman or woman of House Catallus with a skill for killing, and armed extravagantly by the Great House with the finest blades, guns or energy weapons – often supplied by House Van Saar._

_Often helping the Masked Killer in their work is a Mindfrayed. If the Masked Killer is a vision of serene indifference amid the violence of combat then the Mindfrayed is a howling horror, their mask shaped in an expression of utter terror that in turn infects those around them. The purpose of the Mindfrayed is much like that of a hound for a hunter, and the Masked Killer will send the Mindfrayed rushing forward into the unknown to flush out their enemies. This invariably means the Mindfrayed is the first to suffer at the hands of the Carnival’s opponents, but this too is part of the Masked Killer’s plan – and should a foe be foolish enough to cut down the Mindfrayed, they will find a nasty surprise waiting for them._

### Composition

A House Catallus Carnival consists of one Masked Killer and one Mindfrayed.

### House Catallus Carnival Special Rules

**Many Faces, One Purpose:** During the Choose Crew step of the pre-battle sequence, if the scenario uses the
Random (X) Crew selection method, the gang may instead choose one of their fighters to be included in the Crew
in the place of one selected at random. If, however, the gang chooses to use this special rule, then they may not
include the House Catallus Carnival in their crew for this battle. This special rule takes precedence over the “Here
to Help” special rule.

**A Band Apart:** Members of House Catallus take care of their own, especially valued representatives and their
favoured attendants. A House Catallus Carnival will remain separate and aloof from the gang they are working
beside, disappearing during the post-battle sequence to tend to their wounds. If a House Catallus Carnival fighter
goes Out of Action during a battle, there is no need to roll for Lasting Injury; they are considered to have rolled
12-26 Out Cold.

**“Here to Help”:** Unlike other fighters, a House Catallus Carnival is not counted during the Choose Crew step of the
pre-battle sequence. Instead, at the end of this step, these fighters may (and, in some cases, must) be added to
the crew, regardless of the crew selection method in use. This may take the number of fighters in a starting crew
above the number specified by the scenario.

<details>
<summary>Special Rules</summary>

**Indentured Fighter:** If the Masked Killer is removed from play for any reason, the
Mindfrayed, without guidance, will automatically behave as if the crew they are
part of has failed a Bottle test, regardless of how many fighters in total have been
removed from play.

**Infectious Terror:** When a Mindfrayed becomes Pinned, all fighters within 6" that
are Standing and Active (friend or foe) with the exception only of a Masked Killer
(friend or foe) must immediately make a Cool check. If this check is passed, nothing
happens. If, however, this check is failed, the fighter immediately becomes Pinned.
In addition, should a Mindfrayed ever fail a Nerve test, all fighters (friend or foe)
within 6" of the Mindfrayed must also take a Nerve test or become Broken. While
a Mindfrayed is Broken, fighters within 6" of it may not themselves recover from
being Broken.
