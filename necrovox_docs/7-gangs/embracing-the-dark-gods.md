# Embracing The Dark Gods

The taint of Chaos can be found throughout the
depths of Necromunda’s hive cities, its remote ash
waste settlements and even among the decadent
nobles of its spires. None can count themselves safe
from the influence of the Chaos gods, though some
openly embrace the darkness in their thirst for power
and violence.

The following section provides guidelines for creating
a gang dedicated to the Dark Gods or running one
that turns to the worship of Chaos during a campaign. Any of the six House gangs – Orlock, Delaque, Escher, Cawdor, Goliath and Van Saar – can turn to Chaos if
their player chooses.

## Making A Dark Pact

Turning a gang to Chaos can be done in one of two
ways: either the gang can begin dedicated to the
Dark Gods or they can turn during a campaign. During gang creation a player can decide if their gang
is dedicated to the Dark Gods. If they do, they gain the
benefits detailed that follow, but are also automatically
an Outlaw gang (see page 6).

During a campaign a player can attempt to turn to
Chaos by having their Leader make the Dark Ritual
Post-battle action (see page 27). If this action
successfully draws the favour of a Chaos god, or if
one of the gang’s members is turned into a Chaos
Spawn, the gang becomes both a Chaos Corrupted
gang as well as an Outlaw gang.

## Benefits Of Chaos

A Chaos Corrupted gang gains the following benefits:

- Lasting Injuries may become Mutations
  (see page 11).
- The ability to perform Dark Rituals as a post- battle action.
- Fighters in a Chaos Corrupted gang never become
  subject to the Insanity condition even if a scenario
  rule or special rule states that they would.
- The ability to include Chaos Spawn in their gangs
  (see page 28).
- The favour of a Chaos god (see page 27).
  Note that only Helot Chaos Cults gangs are permitted
  to seek the favour of different gods. For Chaos
  Corrupted gangs, once they have received the
  favour of a god, they cannot pray to any others when
  conducting a Dark Ritual.

## Agents Of Misrule

In a Law and Misrule Campaign, any gang that is
dedicated to the Dark Gods or that makes a Dark
Pact automatically becomes aligned to Misrule. They
cannot change their alignment further over the course
of the campaign.

### Designer’s Note: Modelling Chaos Corrupted Gangs

Chaos Corrupted gangs provide a wealth of
modelling opportunities for players. Blood-spattered Goliath gangs dedicated to Khorne, pale-skinned, filth-encrusted Cawdor bowing
down to the Plague God and luridly-coloured
Delaque in the service of Tzeentch are some
of the obvious options, though players really
are limited only by their own imagination (and
perhaps the contents of their bits box!).

While there are no game requirements to model
a Chaos Corrupted gang as different from their
more ‘wholesome’ counterparts (after all Chaos
does love hiding in plain sight), it is certainly
encouraged. Also, in a campaign the Arbitrator
might require Chaos Corrupted gangs to be
distinct from their non-corrupted counterparts, so
that their opponents know what kind of gang they
are facing.

## Blood God

Gangs dedicated to the Blood God thirst for murder
and carnage. These savage fighters enjoy nothing
more than the feel of arterial blood spraying
across their screaming faces and bare arms
as they hack apart their victims. The most
notorious followers of the Blood God on
Necromunda are the Corpse Grinders, though
there are many others who pay homage
to the Lord of Skulls, such as the Quinspire
Deathcults, the Gore Warriors of Mynerva and
there are even whispers of a renegade Goliath
clan known as the Blood Forge.

### Benefits

Helot Chaos Cults and Chaos Corrupted
gangs who have earned the favour of the Blood
God gain the following benefits in their next game:

- Once per round, a single failed Wound roll can be
  re-rolled.
- If a Chaos Spawn is part of the gang’s crew, it gains
  +1 to its Strength characteristic.
- The gang’s Leader adds +1 to their
  Attacks characteristic.

## Plague Lord

Gangs dedicated to the Plague Lord have found
ample places to thrive in the depths of the underhive. Amongst fungal wildernesses and zombie-choked
ruins, muties offer up prayers to their foul deity for
deliverance from their hellish existence. That the
Plague God rewards them with pestilence does little
to diminish their faith, and there are numerous cults
scattered across Necromunda such as the Sons of
the Weeping Sore, the Zombie Herders of Mortis or
the debased ex-Cawdor fane dedicated to the Plague
Emperor Ascendant.

### Benefits

Helot Chaos Cults and Chaos Corrupted gangs who
have earned the Favour of the Plague Lord gain the
following benefits in their next game:

- Once per End phase, a single Recovery roll can be
  re-rolled.
- If a Chaos Spawn is part of the gang’s crew, it gains
  +1 to its Toughness characteristic.
- The gang’s Leader adds +1 to their
  Wounds characteristic.

## Dark Prince

Gangs dedicated to the Dark Prince indulge in
hedonism and excess in all its forms. Pain, terror and
torment drive those pledged to this alluring tyrant, the god’s followers constantly pushing themselves
for ever more extreme sensations. Necromunda’s
spires and their decadent elite make fertile breeding
grounds for such cults, though it is just as likely they
will hide in the shadows of the underhive, such as
the Gentlemen of Pain, disgraced noblemen from the
peaks of the spires who exult in the most unspeakable
pastimes, or the wandering torture-merchants known
as the Screaming Brides.

### Benefits

Helot Chaos Cults and Chaos Corrupted gangs who
have earned the favour of the Dark Prince gain the
following benefits in their next game:

- Once per round, during the Activation phase, two
  fighters that are Ready can be picked and activated
  one after the other, rather than the usual one.
- If a Chaos Spawn is part of the gang’s crew it
  rolls two D6 when determining its movement and
  chooses the highest result.
- The gang’s Leader adds +2 to their
  Movement characteristic.

## Architect Of Fate

Gangs dedicated to the Architect of Fate are
schemers and psykers; always seeking to create
confusion and chaos among the hives. Tapping into
the dark power of the Warp, these Chaos cults pose
perhaps the greatest threat to Necromunda, as they
twist the very stuff of reality to their will. Such cults
can be found hiding throughout Necromunda, such
as the Coven of Eyes dealing secrets in Hive City or
the Wyrdborn gathering up psykers in the underhive. Some are even more ancient and pervasive still, like
the rumoured Immortal Cult of Necromunda, with
its millennia-long mission to bring about the psychic
awakening of humanity, whatever the price…

### Benefits

Helot Chaos Cults and Chaos Corrupted gangs who
have earned the favour of the Architect of Fate gain
the following benefits in their next game:

- Once per round, a single fighter may ignore all
  negative modifiers when making a Shoot (Basic) or
  Shoot (Double) action.
- If a Chaos Spawn is part of the gang’s crew, it gains
  a Save of 4+.
- The gang’s Leader gains a random wyrd power (see
  page 171 of the Necromunda Rulebook).

:::note

### The True Name Of Chaos

The true names of the Chaos gods are seldom
ever spoken in the underhive, even by those in
their service, and the overwhelming majority of
Necromundans are entirely ignorant of the true
nature of the gods at all. However, gangs and
hivers alike know them, and their effects, by other
names. For instance, Tzeentch is the Whisperer, the Watcher or the Dreamer; Slaanesh is the Pale
One, Shadow Ruler or the Nightwild; Khorne is
the Scratcher, the Red God or the Lord of Skin
and Sinew, and Nurgle is the King in Rags and
Tatters, the Lord of Shivers or Old Festus. For ease
of use, the rules use the most well-known names
for the four principal Chaos powers, though it can
be imagined gangs refer to them using the titles
above – if they dare speak their names at all!

## Mutations

Open wounds are a gateway for more than just
disease and rot. The Chaos gods exalt in torn flesh
and severed muscle, bestowing their ‘blessings’ on
those that spill gore in their sight. In addition to the
ever-present risk of infection and death, gangers
fighting beneath the gaze of the Ruinous Powers risk
more unnatural dangers.

When a fighter in a Helot Chaos Cults, Corpse Grinder
Cult or Chaos Corrupted gang gains a Lasting Injury
(regardless of the cause), there is a chance it will
become a mutation. If the result was Lesson Learned,
Out Cold, Grievous Injury, Critical Injury or Memorable
Death, apply the Lasting Injury as normal. Otherwise
roll a D6 with the following modifiers:

- Add 1 if the Lasting Injury was inflicted by a fighter
  from a Chaos Corrupted gang, a Helot Chaos Cults
  gang or a Corpse Grinder gang.
- Add 1 if the Lasting Injury was sustained by a
  Daemon or daemonically possessed fighter.
- Add 1 if the fighter who suffered the Lasting Injury
  already has at least one other mutation.

If the result of the roll is a 6 or more then the Lasting
Injury becomes a mutation. Do not apply the effects of
the Lasting Injury to the fighter, instead make a note
on their Fighter card of the corresponding mutation
(see the Mutations table). The same mutation cannot
be gained more than once. If a fighter would gain a
duplicate mutation, the player may choose another
mutation from the Mutations table instead.

The boons of the Dark Gods always come with a
price, and no one suffers their blessings for long
without succumbing to madness and corruption. As soon as a fighter gains a number of mutations
equal to their Toughness characteristic, they are
transformed into a Chaos Spawn (see page 28) and
removed from the gang roster unless they are part
of a Chaos Cult, Chaos Corrupted or Corpse Grinder
Cult gang – in these cases, the Chaos Spawn is added
to the gang roster immediately.

### Mutations

| Lasting Injury | Mutation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| :------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Humiliated     | **Hungering Pride:** The fighter must activate before any other fighters in their crew. If there is more than one fighter in the crew with this mutation, the controlling player may choose which one to activate first. Fighters with this mutation gain 1 additional Experience point if they take an enemy Leader or Champion Out of Action. |
| Head Injury    | **Dark Madness:** The fighter must make an Intelligence check when they activate. If the test is failed, roll a D6 to determine their first action for this activation: 1-2 Move action, 3-4 Shoot or Fight action, 5-6 No action.                                                                                                              |
| Eye Injury     | **Bestial Senses:** The fighter cannot be included as part of a group activation, nor can they initiate a group activation if they are a Leader or Champion. The fighter counts as always being equipped with a [bio-scanner](/docs/armoury/personal-equipment#bio-scanner).                                                                                                                    |
| Hand Injury    | **Disturbing Appendage:** The fighter always counts as being equipped with a fighting knife which cannot be disarmed or destroyed. When using weapons with the Unwieldy trait, the fighter suffers a -1 modifier to their Weapon Skill or Ballistic Skill rolls.                                                                                |
| Hobbled        | **Warped Limbs:** Reduce the fighter’s Move characteristic by 1. When the fighter makes a Charge action roll three D3, instead of one, and choose the highest to determine the distance they move.                                                                                                                                              |
| Spinal         | **Injury Crooked Body:** Ranged attacks made against the fighter suffer a -1 modifier to hit while within the attacking weapon’s Long range. The fighter cannot wear armour of any kind – any armour they are currently equipped with may be returned to the gang’s Stash.                                                                      |
| Enfeebled      | **Twisted Flesh:** When the fighter activates, they may remove one Flesh Wound from their Fighter card. The fighter cannot benefit from bio-boosters, medicae kits or assistance fromother fighters when making Recovery tests.                                                                                                                 |
