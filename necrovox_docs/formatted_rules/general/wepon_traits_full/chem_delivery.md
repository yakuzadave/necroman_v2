### Chem Delivery

When a weapon with the Chem Delivery trait is used, the fighter declares what
kind of chem they are firing at the target. This can be any chem the fighter is
equipped with (note that firing the weapon does not cost a dose of the chem and
that friendly fighters cannot be targeted), or if the weapon also has the Toxin or
Gas trait, the fighter can use these Traits instead. Instead of making a Wound roll
for a Chem Delivery attack, roll a D6. If the result is equal to or higher than the
target’s Toughness, or is a natural 6, the target is affected by the chosen chem just
as if they had taken a dose. If the roll is lower than the target’s Toughness, they
shrug off the chem’s effects.
