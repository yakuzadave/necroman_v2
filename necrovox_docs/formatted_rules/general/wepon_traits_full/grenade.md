### Grenade

Despite being Wargear, grenades are treated as a
special type of ranged weapon. A fighter equipped
with grenades can throw one as a Shoot (Basic)
action. Grenades do not have a Short range, and their
Long range is determined by multiplying the fighter’s
Strength by the amount shown.

A fighter can only carry a limited number of grenades. The Firepower dice does not need to be rolled when
attacking with a grenade. Instead, after the attack has
been resolved, it is assumed that the Ammo symbol has
been rolled and an Ammo test is made automatically. If
this is failed, grenades cannot be reloaded; the fighter
has run out of that type of grenade and cannot use
them for the remainder of the battle.
