### Flare

A model hit by a weapon with the Flare trait, or who is
touched by a Blast marker fired from a weapon with the
Flare trait, is Revealed if the battlefield is in darkness
(see [[Pitch Black]]). If a weapon has both
the Flare trait and the Blast (X") trait, after determining
where the Blast marker ends up, leave it in place.
In the End phase, roll a D6. On a 4+, the flare goes
out and the marker is removed, otherwise it remains
in play. While the Blast marker is on the battlefield, all
models touched by it are Revealed.
