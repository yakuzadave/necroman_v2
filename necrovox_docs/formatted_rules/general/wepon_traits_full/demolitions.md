### Demolitions

Grenades with the Demolitions trait can be used
when making close combat attacks against scenery
targets (such as locked doors or scenario objectives). A fighter who uses a grenade in this way makes one
attack (regardless of how many Attack dice they would
normally roll), which hits automatically.
