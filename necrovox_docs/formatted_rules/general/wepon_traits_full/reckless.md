### Reckless

Reckless weapons are indiscriminate in what they target:

- Before making a ranged attack with a Reckless weapon, randomly determine the target of the attack from all eligible models (including friendly
  models) within this model’s line of sight and range of the weapon.
- Attacks made with a Reckless weapon that also has the Melee trait are randomly distributed between any
  models (including friendly models) that are in base
  contact with this fighter.
- Attacks made with a Reckless weapon that also has the Versatile trait are randomly distributed between
  any models (including friendly models) that are within the weapon’s Long range.

If the weapon also has the Rapid Fire (X) trait, then
any additional hits generated from the Firepower dice
must be distributed among the maximum number of eligible targets. If there are more hits than eligible targets, the attacker may choose where any spare hits
are allocated.
