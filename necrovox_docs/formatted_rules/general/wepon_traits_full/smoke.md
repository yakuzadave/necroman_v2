### Smoke

Smoke weapons do not cause hits on models – they do
not cause Pinning, and cannot inflict wounds. Instead, mark the location where they hit with a marker. They
generate an area of dense smoke, which extends 2.5"
out from the centre of the marker, vertically as well
as horizontally. Models can move through the smoke, but it blocks line of sight, so attacks cannot be made
into, out of or through it. In the End phase, roll a D6.
On a 4 or less, the cloud dissipates and the marker
is removed.
