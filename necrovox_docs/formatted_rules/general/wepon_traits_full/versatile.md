### Versatile

The wielder of a Versatile weapon does not need to
be in base contact with an enemy model in order to
engage them in melee during their activation. They
may engage and make close combat attacks against
an enemy model during their activation, so long as the
distance between their base and that of the enemy
model is equal to or less than the distance shown for
the Versatile weapon’s Long range characteristic. For
example, a fighter armed with a Versatile weapon with
a Long range of 2" may engage an enemy model that is
up to 2" away.

The enemy model is considered to be engaged, but
may not in turn be Engaging the fighter armed with
the Versatile weapon unless they too are armed with
a Versatile weapon, and so may not be able to make
Reaction attacks.

At all other times other than during this
fighter’s activation, Versatile has no effect.
