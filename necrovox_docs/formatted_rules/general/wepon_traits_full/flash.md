### Flash

If a model is hit by a weapon with the Flash trait, no
wound roll is made. Instead, if the target is a fighter
they must make an Initiative test, and if they are a
vehicle they must make a Handling test. If the test
is failed, they become subject to the Blind condition. A Blind model loses their Ready marker; if they do not
have a Ready marker, they do not gain a Ready marker
at the start of the following round. Until the next time
the model is activated, they cannot make any attacks
other than Reaction attacks, for which any hit rolls will
only succeed on a natural 6.
