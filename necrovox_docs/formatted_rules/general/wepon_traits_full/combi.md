### Combi

A combi-weapon has two profiles. When it is fired, pick
one of the two profiles and use it for the attack. Due to
the compact nature of these weapons, they often have
less capacity for ammunition, and are prone to jamming
and other minor issues. When making an Ammo test
for either of the weapons, roll twice and apply the
worst result. However, unlike most weapons that have
two profiles, ammo for the two parts of the combiweapon are tracked separately – if one profile runs Out
of Ammo, the other can still fire unless it has also run
Out of Ammo.
