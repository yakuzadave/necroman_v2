### Seismic

If a fighter hit by a weapon with this Trait is Standing
and Active, they will always become Prone and Pinned – even if they have an ability that would normally allow
them to avoid becoming Prone and Pinned by ranged
attacks. If a vehicle is hit by a weapon with this Trait,
after the attack has been fully resolved the vehicle
must make a Loss of Control test.

In addition, if the wound roll for a Seismic weapon
is a natural 6, no save roll can be made against
that attack.
