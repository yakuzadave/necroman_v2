### Toxin

Instead of making a wound roll for a Toxin attack, roll a D6. If the result is equal to or higher than
the target’s Toughness, or is a natural 6, make
an Injury roll for them (regardless of their Wounds
characteristic). If the roll is lower than the
target’s Toughness, they shrug off the toxin’s effects. This attack has no effect on vehicles.
