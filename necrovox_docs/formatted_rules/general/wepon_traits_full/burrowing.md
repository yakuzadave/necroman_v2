### Burrowing

Burrowing weapons can be fired at targets outside of the firer’s line of sight. When
firing at a target outside of line of sight do not make an attack roll, instead place
the 3" Blast marker anywhere on the battlefield, then move it 2D6" in a direction
determined by the Scatter dice. If a Hit is rolled on the Scatter dice, the Blast marker
does not move. At the start of the End phase of the round in which this weapon was
fired, before step 1, any fighters touched by the marker are hit by the weapon.

Note that this Blast marker can move through impassable terrain such as walls
and may move off the battlefield. If the Blast marker does move off the battlefield, the attack will have no effect. Burrowing weapons are capable of digging through
several levels of wall and flooring, and can be used regardless of where the fighter is
positioned on the battlefield.
