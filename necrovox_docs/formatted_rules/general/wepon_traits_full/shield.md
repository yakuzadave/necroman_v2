### Assault Shield/Energy Shield

An assault/energy shield grants a +2 armour save modifier (to a maximum of 2+)
against melee attacks that originate from within the fighter’s vision arc (the 90° arc
to their front), and a +1 armour save modifier against ranged attacks that originate
from within the fighter’s vision arc; check this before the fighter is placed Prone and
is Pinned. If it is not clear whether the attacker is within the target’s Front arc, use
a Vision Arc template to check – if the centre of the attacker’s base is within the
arc, the assault/energy shield can be used. Against attacks with the Blast trait, use
the centre of the Blast marker in place of the attacker. If the target does not have a
facing (for example, if they are Prone), the assault/energy shield cannot be used.
