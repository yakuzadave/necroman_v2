### Drag

If a fighter is hit by a Drag weapon but not taken
Out of Action, the attacker can attempt to drag the
target closer after the attack has been resolved.
If they do, roll a D6. If the score is equal to or higher
than the target’s Strength, the target is dragged D3"
straight towards the attacker, stopping if they hit any
terrain. If they move into another fighter (other than
the attacker), both fighters are moved the remaining
distance towards the attacker. If the weapon also has
the Impale special rule and hits more than one fighter, only the last fighter to be hit can be dragged.
