### Rapid Fire (X)

When firing with a Rapid Fire weapon, a successful
hit roll scores a number of hits equal to the number
of bullet holes on the Firepower dice. In addition, the
controlling player can roll more than one Firepower
dice, up to the number shown in brackets (for example, when firing a Rapid Fire (2) weapon, up to two Firepower dice can be rolled). Make an Ammo test for each Ammo symbol that is rolled. If any of them fail, the gun runs Out of Ammo. If two or more of them fail, the gun has jammed and cannot be used for the rest
of the battle.

If a Rapid Fire weapon scores more than one hit, the hits can be split between multiple targets. The
first must be allocated to the original target, but the remainder can be allocated to other models within 3"
of the first who are also within range and line of sight. These must not be any harder to hit than the original target – if a target in the open is hit, an obscured target cannot have hits allocated to it. Allocate all of the hits before making any wound rolls.
