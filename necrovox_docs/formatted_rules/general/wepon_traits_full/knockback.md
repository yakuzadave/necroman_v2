### Knockback

When a weapon with the Knockback trait hits a
fighter, if the hit roll is equal to or higher than the
target’s Strength, they are immediately moved 1"
directly away from the attacking model. If the fighter
cannot be moved the full 1" because of impassable
terrain or another model, they move as far as possible
and the attack’s Damage is increased by 1. If a Blast
weapon has the Knockback trait, roll a D6 for each
fighter that is hit. If the result is equal to or higher than
their Strength, they are knocked back as described
above – however, they are moved directly away from
the centre of the Blast marker instead. If the centre
of the Blast marker was over the centre of their base, roll a Scatter dice to determine which way they are
moved. If a Melee weapon has the Knockback trait,
the attacking fighter can choose to follow the target
up, moving directly towards them after they have been
knocked back to remain in base contact. If the attack
was made across a barricade, the attacker cannot
do this. If any part of the knocked back fighter’s base
crosses the edge of a platform, make an Initiative test.
If this is failed, they will fall. If this is passed, they stop
moving at the edge of the platform.
