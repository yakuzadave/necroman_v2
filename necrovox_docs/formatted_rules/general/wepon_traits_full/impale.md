### Impale

If an attack made by this weapon hits a fighter and
wounds the target, and the save roll is unsuccessful
(or no save roll is made), the projectile continues
through them and might hit another model! Trace a
straight line from the target, directly away from the
attacker. If there are any models within 1" of this line, and within the weapon’s Long range, the one that is
closest to the target is at risk of being hit. Roll a D6. On
a 3 or more, resolve the weapon’s attack against that
model, subtracting 1 from the Strength. The projectile
can continue through multiple fighters in this way, but if the Strength is reduced to 0, it cannot hit any
more models.
