Instead of rolling to wound normally with this weapon, any fighter caught in the Blast must instead roll equal
to or under their Strength on a D6 (a roll of 6 always
counts as a fail), or suffer Damage with no armour
save allowed; any vehicle caught in the Blast must
instead roll equal or over the Toughness value of the
facing hit on a D6 (a roll of a 6 always counts as a
success), or suffer a hit to the Body with no armour
