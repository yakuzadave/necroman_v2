## Description
**Tech Bazaar**

As you step into the Tech Bazaar, the cacophony of sounds and smells envelops you. The air is thick with the acrid tang of ozone and smoke, mingling with the sweet scent of freshly minted credits. The dimly lit market stalls, a tangle of makeshift structures and scavenged materials, seem to stretch on forever, each one promising a treasure trove of illicit goods and forbidden knowledge.

The crowd is a mix of shady dealers, desperate traders, and cunning entrepreneurs, all vying for your attention. You notice a few familiar faces, some old acquaintances from the underhive, haggling over prices or making deals in hushed tones.

To one side, a group of scavengers are gathered around a makeshift workbench, tinkering with salvaged machinery and scraps of metal. They glance up at you with a mixture of curiosity and suspicion, their hands stained with grease and oil.

Nearby, a lone figure stands atop a crate, shouting out offers on a battered loudspeaker. "Get the best deals in town! Rare components, top-grade gear, and more! Come see what I've got!" The vendor's eyes gleam with a mixture of enthusiasm and desperation as they try to entice passersby.

As you make your way through the market, you notice that some stalls are heavily guarded by burly thugs or cyber-enhanced enforcers. Others seem to be run by lone operators, their wares displayed on makeshift tables or in battered briefcases.

## Special Rules
Here's an updated version of the Tech Bazaar territory with special rules:

**Tech Bazaar**

* **Income:** Roll `dice: 1d6` for each fighter in your gang that enters the Tech Bazaar. On a roll of 3 or higher, they can salvage a random item from the Trading Post or Black Market (see below).
* **Special Rules:** "Market Mayhem"
	+ When another gang tries to take control of the Tech Bazaar, roll `dice: 1d6` and add the result to your gang's total combat strength. If the total equals or exceeds the attacker's combat strength, you gain a +1 bonus to your gang's combat performance for the remainder of the battle.
	+ Additionally, if an enemy fighter is within 6" of the Tech Bazaar's central hub when the battle begins, they must immediately roll `dice: 1d6` and add the result to their own combat strength. If the total equals or exceeds your gang's combat strength, the enemy fighter gains a +1 bonus to their combat performance for the remainder of the battle.

**Trading Post:**

* A rare and valuable data-slate containing ancient knowledge
* A set of high-grade power cells for your gang's equipment
* A cache of credits to spend on upgrades or gear

**Black Market:**

* A pair of razor-sharp combat knives with built-in toxin injectors
* A prototype grav-gun that fires sticky, adhesive rounds
* A canister of smoke grenades with a chance to confuse enemies

## Income
As the Tech Bazaar territory, your gang can earn income from controlling this location.

To determine the income generated, you'll need to roll `dice: 1d6` and add the result to the base income value of 5. For example:

Rolling for income: `dice: 1d6`
Result: [insert result]

Adding the result to the base income value:
[insert result] + 5 = [total income]

In this case, if you roll a 4 and add it to the base income value of 5, your total income would be:

4 + 5 = 9

So, your gang would earn 9 credits from controlling the Tech Bazaar.

Keep in mind that this is just the basic income generated by controlling the location. Any additional income or bonuses will depend on the specific circumstances and any special rules or boons associated with the territory.
