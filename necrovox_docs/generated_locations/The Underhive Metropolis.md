## Description
**The Underhive Metropolis**

As you step into the Underhive Metropolis, the air thickens with the stench of smoke and pollution. The sounds of machinery hum in the distance, a constant reminder of the city's industrial heartbeat. The streets are narrow and winding, with cramped alleyways and crumbling buildings that seem to lean in on each other like tired drunks.

Raven's Row, Steelhaven Way, Copperhead Lane, and Gutter Run form the main thoroughfares of this sprawling metropolis. Each street has its own unique character: Raven's Row is a seedy barrio filled with shady characters and illicit trade; Steelhaven Way is a bustling commercial hub where factories and warehouses hum with activity; Copperhead Lane is a residential area where makeshift homes and tenements crowd the streets; and Gutter Run is a treacherous alleyway filled with debris, traps, and ambushes.

Beneath the city's surface lies a labyrinthine network of underhive tunnels and caverns. These dark, damp passages are home to gangs, scavengers, and opportunists who eke out a living in the shadows. The air is stale, and the only light comes from flickering lumens or the occasional flash of gunfire.

**Key Locations**

* **The Old Cathedral**: A ruined church with crumbling stone walls and stained glass windows that filter the dim light. From its vantage point, you can see much of the city's layout, making it a prime location for gang leaders to survey their territory.
* **The Tech Bazaar**: A sprawling marketplace where gangs can trade goods, information, and services. The air is thick with the smell of oil, electronics, and desperation. This is the heart of the Underhive Metropolis, where alliances are forged and broken, and fortunes rise and fall.
* **The Corpse Farm**: A gruesome slaughterhouse that supplies meat to the city's markets. The stench of death hangs heavy in the air, and the sound of screams and butchering echoes through the corridors.

**Territory Boons**

As you navigate this treacherous landscape, you'll encounter unique boons that can aid or hinder your progress:

* **Toll Crossing (Orlock)**: Priority in the first round of any battle. Any gang can pay 20 credits to gain this benefit against another gang.
* **Archaeotech Device (Van Saar)**: Choose 2 Traits instead of 1 from the list above.
* **Tech Bazaar (Van Saar)**: Income: D6x10 (+1D6x10 if also controlling Archaeotech Device). Reputation: +1 (T, O).
* **Reputation (Van Saar)**: +2 (T, O)
* **Refuse Drift (Necromunda)**: Roll a dice to determine the outcome of a negotiation or trade.
* **Gutter Run Gangs**: Roll a dice to determine which gang controls Gutter Run and what their intentions are.

As you explore this unforgiving environment, remember that every decision has consequences. Will you form alliances with other gangs, or will you strike out on your own? The fate of the Underhive Metropolis hangs in the balance, waiting for your arrival.

## Special Rules
Let's define some special rules for the Underhive Metropolis territory.

**Special Rules:**

* **Tech Sabotage:** When a gang attempts to take control of the Tech Bazaar, there is a 50% chance that their equipment will malfunction due to Van Saar's sabotage. The affected fighters must re-roll any successful attacks or tests.
* **Corpse Farm Ambush:** When a gang tries to take control of the Corpse Farm, they are ambushed by Cawdor's loyalist forces. The defending gang gets +1 to their combat rolls for this battle.
* **Raven's Row Riot:** Whenever an Orlock gang attempts to take control of Raven's Row, there is a 25% chance that a riot breaks out, causing all fighters in the area to suffer -1 to their combat rolls for the remainder of the battle.

These special rules will add an extra layer of complexity and challenge to battles involving these locations. As the Van Saar gang, we'll need to be strategic about when to engage in combat and how to mitigate the effects of these special rules.

Now that we have our strategy and special rules in place, let's see what kind of chaos erupts in the Underhive Metropolis...

## Income
According to the Territory Boons, the Van Saar gang can generate income through the Tech Bazaar boon: "Income: D6x10 (+1D6x10 if also controlling Archaeotech Device)".

Since we are controlling the Tech Bazaar and also have the Archaeotech Device, our income would be:

* `dice: 2d6x10 = 20-40 credits` (base income)
* Plus an additional `dice: 1d6x10 = 10-20 credits` (bonus from Archaeotech Device)

So, our total income would be `20-40 + 10-20 = 30-60 credits`.

To generate this income, the gang needs to roll:

* `dice: 2d6x10`
* `dice: 1d6x10`

These rolls will determine the amount of credits generated by controlling the Tech Bazaar and the Archaeotech Device.
