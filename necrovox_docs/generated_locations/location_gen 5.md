As you approach the scavengers, they glance up at you with a mixture of curiosity and suspicion, their hands stained with grease and oil. The makeshift workbench is cluttered with salvaged machinery, scraps of metal, and various components. You notice a few items that catch your eye:

* A collection of wires, circuit boards, and metal plates, which might be useful for upgrading your gang's equipment or vehicle.
* A partially disassembled engine block, which could potentially be used to improve the performance of your gang's vehicles.
* A small pile of ammunition casings, which might be useful for restocking your gang's arsenal.

The scavenger who approached you leans in, eyeing your gear and equipment. "Hey, what can we do for you? We've got some great deals on salvaged parts, maybe something to help your gang upgrade their gear."

You notice that the scavengers are looking at you with a calculating gaze, weighing the potential value of trading with you. You sense that they're willing to negotiate, but only if it's in their favor.

The scavenger who approached you speaks up again, "We've got a few things that might interest you. This engine block, for instance... it's still got some life left in it. We could let it go for 50 credits and a few scraps of metal." He eyes your gear, then continues, "Or, if you're looking to upgrade your gang's arsenal, we've got a batch of ammunition casings that would be perfect for your needs. We'll sell them to you for 20 credits per casing."

As you consider the offers, you notice a few other scavengers in the background, eyeing your gear and equipment with interest. You sense that they might be willing to make some deals as well, but it's going to take some negotiating.

## Description
The Tech Bazaar's scavengers welcome you with a mixture of curiosity and caution, their hands still stained with grease and oil from their latest projects. The makeshift workbench is cluttered with an assortment of salvaged machinery, scraps of metal, and various components. A few broken lasguns lie nearby, their parts being cannibalized to create new, makeshift devices.

The scavenger who approached you, a burly individual with a thick beard, eyes your gear and equipment before speaking in a gravelly voice. "Ah, you're lookin' for some upgrades, eh? Well, we might have just the thing for you."

He gestures to a small pile of components and scraps nearby, including some wires, circuit boards, and metal plates. "We've got a few things that might interest you. This lot of wiring could be useful for upgrading your gang's vehicle's engine performance. It's not top-of-the-line stuff, but it'll get the job done."

He holds up a small, makeshift device made from scavenged parts. "This little beauty is a prototype we're working on. It's a makeshift las-cutter that can be used to trim down thick metal plates or even cut through certain types of armor. We're still tweaking the design, but it shows promise."

The scavenger eyes you appraisingly before continuing. "As for prices... well, we're not looking to make a killing (laughs). A few hundred credits should cover most of what you see here. Maybe a bit more if you're interested in taking on some of our side projects. We've got a few... unusual requests from other gangs and factions that might interest you."

The air is thick with the smell of oil, metal, and smoke as you survey the Tech Bazaar's scavengers and their wares. What would you like to do?

Linked Territory: [Abandoned Factory]

## Special Rules
The Tech Bazaar's scavengers seem eager to do business! As I ask them about their salvaged parts, they lead me to a makeshift stall tucked away in a corner of the market. The stall is cluttered with an assortment of components, wires, and scraps of metal.

One of the scavengers, a burly individual with a thick beard, greets me with a wide grin. "Ah, you're looking for some sweet deals, eh? Well, we've got just the thing for you."

He shows me a selection of salvaged parts, including:

* A set of upgraded engine components that could boost the performance of my gang's vehicles (Cost: 100 credits)
* A batch of combat-grade power cells that would enhance the firepower of my gang's weapons (Cost: 150 credits)
* A collection of rare and exotic minerals that could be used to craft unique wargear or upgrade existing equipment (Cost: 200 credits)

As we negotiate, I notice a few other scavengers lingering in the background, eyeing me with a mix of curiosity and suspicion. It's clear they're sizing me up, wondering if I'm worth doing business with.

The burly scavenger leans in, his voice taking on a conspiratorial tone. "Listen, friend, we've got a special deal for you. If you're willing to take a chance on some... 'rare' components, we can give you an exclusive discount. But be warned: these parts might not work as advertised."

He hands me a small pouch containing three mysterious components:

* A strange-looking crystal that seems to pulse with energy (Cost: unknown)
* A set of cryptic schematics that appear to be for a high-tech device (Cost: unknown)
* A vial of glowing liquid that seems to have no discernible purpose (Cost: unknown)

The scavenger winks at me. "These are our 'special' items. We're not sure what they do, but we think they might be worth something to the right buyer."

**Special Rules for The Tech Bazaar**

* **Scavenger's Gambit**: When another gang attempts to take control of The Tech Bazaar, roll a dice (1d6). On a 4+ the scavengers will intervene, using their skills and resources to hinder the attackers' efforts. This can include setting up traps, sabotaging equipment, or even engaging in combat themselves.
* **Market Mayhem**: If a gang is defeated while attempting to take control of The Tech Bazaar, they must first pay off the scavengers' "finder's fee" before leaving the location. This fee is equal to 50% of the credits spent on the special components.

## Boons
The Tech Bazaar's scavengers take a closer look at you, sizing you up before responding.

"Ah, you're looking for some good deals, huh?" says the lead scavenger. "We've got some interesting components here. Let me show you what we've got."

He gestures to a nearby pile of salvaged parts, including some wires, circuit boards, and metal plates. "We've got some decent wiring and circuitry here that could be useful for upgrading your gang's vehicles or equipment. We're looking for 50 credits per unit, or 100 credits if you take the whole lot."

He eyes you thoughtfully before continuing. "And then there's this... This is a rare find, even among scavengers like us. It's an old Imperial-issue power source module. Should be worth a pretty penny to someone looking to upgrade their gear. We're asking 200 credits for it, or 300 if you take the whole thing."

As he talks, I notice that the scavengers seem to be working on some sort of makeshift generator. It looks like they might be trying to create something new and useful out of scraps.

**Benefits:**

* Controlling this territory allows your gang to upgrade their vehicles and equipment with salvaged parts from the Tech Bazaar.
* The power source module could be used to improve your gang's combat capabilities or provide a reliable energy source for your operations.
* The scavengers may be willing to trade or sell other valuable components and scraps to your gang, as long as you're willing to pay their prices.

## Income
The Tech Bazaar's scavengers are eager to show off their wares! The leader, a grizzled old mechanic named Grimjack, looks you up and down before speaking in a gravelly voice.

"Ah, you're lookin' for some salvageable parts, eh? Well, we might have just the thing. We've got a few scraps of metal plate that could be useful for patching up your gang's vehicles. And if you're lucky, we might even have some working servos or actuators to upgrade your gear.

"As for prices... well, let's just say we're reasonable folks. A small pile of scrap metal like this might go for 50 credits, maybe a few scraps of food or some spare ammo. If you're lookin' for something more exotic, like a working power source or a decent plasma gun, that'll be a bit pricier... say around 200-300 credits.

"But hey, we're not just about sellin' stuff. We're also happy to trade in other goods and services. Maybe your gang's got some skills or resources that'd be useful to us? We might have some work for you, if the price is right."

To determine the income generated by controlling this location, I suggest rolling a 2d6:

`dice: (2d6) * 10`

This will give you a total of 20-40 credits per turn, depending on the roll.

## Dice Rolls
The scavengers' eyes light up at your interest, and they begin to rummage through their pile of components. After a few moments, one of them holds up a small, intricately wired device.

"Ah, we've got just the thing for you," he says, eyeing you with a sly grin. "This here's a salvaged Engine Governor chip. It'll give your gang's vehicle an extra boost in terms of speed and maneuverability. We're looking for 50 credits and a few scraps of decent metal plate."

Another scavenger holds up a small crate filled with various components.

"We've also got some spare parts for your gang's guns. These are high-quality, salvaged from the latest Enforcer models. They'll give your gang an edge in combat. We're looking for 30 credits and a few good pieces of wire."

The third scavenger holds up a small, intricately carved box.

"And if you're interested in something a bit more... exotic," he says with a wink, "we've got this box of rare, salvaged components. It's said to have been plucked from the wreckage of an ancient Imperial Knight. We're looking for 100 credits and a few good pieces of circuit board."

## Linked Territories
The scavengers take notice of my interest and begin to rummage through their pile of components. "Ah, yeah! We've got some nice bits and bobs here," one of them says, holding up a small crate filled with wires and circuit boards. "This lot's got some good stuff in it - might be useful for upgrading your gang's tech."

They show me a few items that catch my eye:

* A salvaged power source unit (PSU) that could potentially boost our vehicle's engine performance
* A set of enhanced targeting optics that could improve our combat capabilities
* A crate of assorted wires and circuit boards that might be useful for repairing or upgrading equipment

As I examine the goods, the scavengers ask me what I'm willing to pay. They're looking for a combination of credits and resources - specifically, they want 50 credits per item, plus an additional 10 credits if I can provide some spare parts or materials from my gang's inventory.

The scavenger hands me a small note with their proposal written on it:
