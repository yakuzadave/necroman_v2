**Tunnel Network**

# Location Details
## Description

The Tunnel Network is a vast network of tunnels and passageways that crisscross the underhive. It's a labyrinthine maze, with hidden entrances, secret passages, and treacherous dead ends. Gangs who control this territory can move freely through the tunnels, striking at their enemies from unexpected angles.
The Tunnel Network is a complex network of tunnels and passageways in the underhive, allowing gangs to move undetected and strike from unexpected angles.

**Tunnel Network (Orlock)**

* **Territory Boon:** The gang earns D6x10 credits from this Territory when collecting income.
* **Special:** Whilst it controls this Territory, the gang may choose to have up to three fighters deploy via tunnels ahead of any battle. These fighters must be part of the crew for the battle, but instead of being set up on the battlefield, they are placed to one side. During the Deployment phase, the player sets up two 2" wide tunnel entrance markers on any table edge on the ground surface of the battlefield. During the Priority phase of each turn, roll a D6. If the result is a 5 or more, the fighters deploy from the tunnels and can immediately attack an enemy fighter within range. If the roll is 1-4, no fighters deploy.
* **Enhanced Boon:** Whilst it controls this Territory, the gang adds +2 to its Reputation.


## Special Rules

* **Tunnel Vision**: When moving through the Tunnel Network, add +1 to all Move rolls.
* **Hidden Entrances**: The gang can set up hidden entrances and exits in the Tunnel Network. These allow them to deploy fighters or escape quickly during a battle. Each entrance/exits costs 10 credits to set up.

**Tunnel Vision**

As you navigate through the winding tunnels of this Territory, your familiarity with the layout grants you an uncanny sense of direction. When moving through the Tunnel Network, add +1 to all Move rolls. This boon allows you to quickly reposition your forces or make a swift escape from danger.

**Hidden Entrances**

The labyrinthine nature of this Territory's tunnels provides ample opportunities for covert operations and tactical deployments. As long as you control this Territory, you can set up hidden entrances and exits in the Tunnel Network. These secret passages allow your gang to deploy fighters or make a quick exit during a battle.

Each entrance/exits costs 10 credits to set up, which is a small price to pay for the strategic flexibility they offer. With these hidden routes, you can:

1. **Deploy Surprise**: Use an entrance to suddenly drop in reinforcements or launch a surprise attack on your enemies.
2. **Escape and Evade**: Make a swift exit through an exit point to avoid taking damage or get away from a losing battle.
3. **Ambush Enemies**: Set up an ambush by deploying fighters at a hidden entrance, catching your foes off guard.

Remember that these hidden entrances are only accessible while you control this Territory. If the territory falls into enemy hands, the entrances become known and lose their tactical value.

By controlling this Territory, your Van Saar gang gains **Tunnel Vision** and can set up **Hidden Entrances**, giving you a significant edge in navigating the underhive's tunnels and outmaneuvering your rivals.

They can move freely through the tunnels, striking at their enemies from unexpected angles and catching them off guard. This allows them to gain an upper hand in battles and disrupt their opponents' plans.


#### Tactics
To make the most of this territory, Orlock gangs should focus on building a strong presence in the tunnels. This involves deploying fighters with high Mobility values, such as those with the Tunnel Rat or Underground Expert Traits. By moving quickly and quietly through the tunnels, these fighters can catch enemies off guard and gain an advantage.


In addition to deploying fighters through the tunnels, Orlock gangs should also focus on building a strong reputation in the underhive. This involves gaining experience points by fighting battles and completing missions, as well as making deals with other gangs and factions. By building their reputation, Orlock gangs can gain access to new equipment, weapons, and allies that will help them dominate the tunnel network.


**Battlefield Setup**
When deploying fighters through the Tunnel Network, players should follow these steps:

1. Determine which side of the battlefield the fighter is entering from.
2. Roll a D6 to determine how many inches the fighter can move into the battlefield without being detected by enemies.
3. The player then moves their fighter that distance along the tunnel network, using any obstacles or features in the terrain to block line of sight and protect them from enemy fire.

By controlling the Tunnel Network, Orlock gangs can gain a significant advantage on the battlefield and disrupt their opponents' plans.
