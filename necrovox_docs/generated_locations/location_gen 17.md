## New Territory

**The Necropolis**:
- Bonus: +1 to Necromancy rolls during battles.

**Description:**
The Necropolis stands as a grim reminder of the city's dark past, a sprawling necropolis filled with ancient tombs, mausoleums, and crypts. The air is thick with the scent of decay, and eerie whispers seem to echo through the winding corridors of the necropolis. Shadows dance along the walls, and the faint glow of ghostly lights flicker in the darkness.

**Benefits:**
Gangs that control the Necropolis tap into the forbidden knowledge of necromancy that permeates the very essence of the territory. The dark energies of the necropolis grant them the ability to commune with the spirits of the dead, raising fallen fighters as undead minions to fight alongside them in battle. These undead minions are loyal to their summoners and strike fear into the hearts of their enemies.

**Strategic Importance:**
The Necropolis is a coveted territory for gangs seeking to harness the power of death itself. By mastering the art of necromancy, gangs can bolster their forces with undead warriors, turning what would have been defeat into victory on the battlefield. The ability to raise fallen fighters as undead minions provides a tactical advantage, allowing gangs to replenish their ranks and overwhelm their opponents with sheer numbers.

**Risks:**
However, delving too deeply into the dark arts of necromancy comes with its own risks. The spirits of the dead are not always obedient, and there is always the danger of losing control over the undead minions, leading to chaos and potential betrayal. Furthermore, other gangs may view the Necropolis as a threat and seek to challenge the gang in control, sparking fierce battles for dominance over the territory and its dark powers.

By strategically gaining control of the Necropolis, gangs can unlock the secrets of necromancy and wield its power to dominate their rivals in battles within the Dominion Campaign, but they must tread carefully in the realm of the dead to avoid the dire consequences that come with meddling in forces beyond mortal understanding.

## Description
**The Necropolis**:
  
The Necropolis stands as a grim testament to the twisted and macabre practices of the underbelly of Necromunda. This desolate and eerie territory is shrouded in a perpetual mist that seems to seep from the very earth, obscuring ancient tombstones and crumbling mausoleums. Whispers of lost souls and restless spirits echo through the twisted alleys, sending shivers down the spines of even the most hardened gangers.

Gangs that dare to lay claim to the Necropolis find themselves immersed in the dark arts of necromancy, an ancient and forbidden practice that seeks to bend the powers of death to the wielder's will. Through rituals and incantations performed within the shadowed catacombs, those who control the Necropolis can call upon the spirits of the departed to aid them in battle. Fallen fighters rise once more as spectral warriors, their hollow eyes glowing with an otherworldly light as they heed the commands of their necromantic masters.

The air within the Necropolis is heavy with the scent of decay and the whispers of the dead, but those who can brave its haunted depths will find themselves granted a boon in their mastery of necromancy. The bonus to Necromancy rolls bestowed upon the controlling gang allows them to more effectively command their undead minions, bolstering their forces with spectral allies who strike fear into the hearts of their enemies.

As the dark energies of the Necropolis course through their veins, gang leaders must tread carefully, for the line between mastery and madness is thin when dealing with powers beyond the grave. Only those who can harness the secrets of this unholy place will be able to harness its power and secure their dominance in the Dominion Campaign.
