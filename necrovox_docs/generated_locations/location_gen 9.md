Let's expand on Scrapheap Market and make it a more immersive location within the Necromunda universe.

**Scrapheap Market: The Underhive's Treasure Trove**

As you navigate through the cramped alleys and makeshift stalls of Scrapheap Market, the air is thick with the smell of ozone, rust, and decay. The market's labyrinthine layout is a testament to its history as a hub for scavenging and trading in salvaged goods.

**The Market Hub: A Hub of Activity**

At the heart of Scrapheap Market lies the Market Hub, a large, makeshift stage where traders and buyers gather to negotiate deals, share rumors, and exchange information. The Hub is flanked by two massive, rusted pipes that serve as makeshift pillars, supporting the market's precarious structure. Here, you'll find the market's most influential figures: the Traders' Guild, a group of entrepreneurs who control the flow of goods and information within the market.

**Scavenger Rows: A Maze of Opportunities**

The Scavenger Rows are narrow alleys lined with makeshift stalls, where scavengers peddle their wares. These alleys are a maze of opportunities, filled with an assortment of salvaged goods, from rare components to illicit goods. You'll find everything from rusty machinery parts to exotic spices and potent narcotics.

**The Boneyard: A Battleground**

The Boneyard is a large, open area filled with discarded machinery, crates, and debris. This space is perfect for setting up ambushes or staging battles between rival gangs, traders, and scavengers. The Boneyard's unique layout allows for intense close-quarters combat, making it a hotspot for gang warfare.

**Inhabitants: A Diverse Cast of Characters**

Scrapheap Market is home to a diverse cast of characters, including:

1. **Scavengers**: Humans, mutants, and other creatures that eke out a living by scavenging the underhive's leftovers.
2. **Market Traders**: Entrepreneurs who've made a name for themselves in the Scrapheap Market, offering everything from rare components to illicit goods.
3. **Raiders**: Gangs of opportunistic thieves and marauders that prey on unsuspecting traders and scavengers.
4. **Mutant Beasts**: Feral creatures that roam the market's periphery, attracted by the scent of food and salvageable scraps.

**Threats: A Constant Menace**

Scrapheap Market is a hub of activity, but it's also a hotbed of conflict. The constant threat of:

1. **Raiders**: Gangs of opportunistic thieves and marauders that prey on unsuspecting traders and scavengers.
2. **Mutant Beasts**: Feral creatures that roam the market's periphery, attracted by the scent of food and salvageable scraps.

makes it a challenging location to navigate. Will you emerge victorious from this treacherous marketplace, or will you become just another statistic in the underhive's endless cycle of violence?

Which scenario would you like to play out? Let me know, and I'll help guide you through the Dominion Campaign!

## Description
The labyrinthine Scrapheap Market! As you venture into this territory, the air is thick with the smell of smoke, oil, and decay. The market's maze-like layout is a result of its haphazard construction on top of old pipes, ducts, and machinery. Narrow alleys, known as Scavenger Rows, wind their way through the market, lined with makeshift stalls where scavengers peddle their wares.

The Boneyard, a large open area filled with discarded machinery, crates, and debris, is a hotspot for ambushes or staging battles. The sound of clanging metal and hissing pipes fills the air as traders and buyers haggle over prices. In the midst of this chaos, the Market Hub stands out – a central meeting point where traders and buyers gather to negotiate deals, auction off rare finds, or simply socialize.

As you navigate the market, you'll encounter a diverse array of inhabitants. Scavengers, a mix of humans, mutants, and other creatures, eke out a living by scavenging the underhive's leftovers. They're often found haggling over prices, trading in salvaged goods, or simply trying to survive another day.

Market Traders, on the other hand, are entrepreneurs who've made a name for themselves in the Scrapheap Market. They offer everything from rare components to illicit goods, always looking for ways to expand their operations and increase their profits.

But beware – not everyone in the market is as they seem. Raiders, gangs of opportunistic thieves and marauders, prey on unsuspecting traders and scavengers. And then there are the Mutant Beasts, feral creatures that roam the market's periphery, attracted by the scent of food and salvageable scraps.

As you explore Scrapheap Market, remember to keep your wits about you. In this treacherous environment, only the most cunning and resourceful will survive...

## Special Rules
Excellent! Let's add some special rules to Scrapheap Market to make it a more formidable territory in the Dominion Campaign.

**Special Rules:**

1. **Market Mayhem**: When a gang attempts to take control of Scrapheap Market, roll 2D6 for each member of the gang. If the total equals or exceeds the gang's number of fighters, the gang can enter the market without restrictions.
2. **Scavenger Swarms**: When a gang is engaged in combat within Scrapheap Market, there is a 1/3 chance (roll 1d6 and add 1; if the result equals or exceeds 4, the rule applies) that scavengers will swarm to the gang's location. The gang must then fight off the scavengers before continuing their battle.
3. **Raiders' Revenge**: If a gang is defeated while attempting to take control of Scrapheap Market, there is a 1/2 chance (roll 1d6; if the result equals or exceeds 3, the rule applies) that raiders will appear at the market's periphery, seeking revenge against the losing gang. The gang must then face the raiders in combat.

These special rules add an extra layer of challenge and excitement to battles within Scrapheap Market. Remember, these rules only apply when a gang is trying to take control of the territory, not when they're simply passing through or trading with the market's inhabitants.

Now that we have Scrapheap Market defined, let's determine which scenario to play out using the Dominion Rules. Roll 2D6:

What are the results?

## Boons
Now that we have Scrapheap Market linked to Tech Bazaar, let's determine which scenario to play out. Since you didn't roll for it, I'll suggest a few options based on the territory's characteristics.

**Scenario Options:**

1. **Raiders' Ambush**: A group of raiders has set up an ambush in The Boneyard, targeting traders and scavengers who venture too far into the market.
2. **Market Heist**: A gang of thieves is attempting to steal a valuable shipment of salvageable goods from one of the Market Traders.
3. **Mutant Uprising**: A pack of mutant beasts has begun to terrorize the market's periphery, and the gang must decide whether to hunt them down or try to negotiate with their leader.

Which scenario would you like to play out? Please respond with the number of your chosen scenario (1-3). If you'd like to roll for it, I can guide you through the process using the Dominion rules.

As a reminder, controlling Scrapheap Market will grant your gang the following **Boons or Benefits:**

* Access to rare and salvaged components for upgrading equipment
* Opportunities to trade with other gangs and factions in the underhive
* A chance to acquire illicit goods and information from market traders
* The ability to set up ambushes and defenses within the market's maze-like environment

Let me know which scenario you'd like to play out, and we'll get started!

## Income
Let's determine the income generated by controlling Scrapheap Market.

**Territory Income:** Medium-High (3-5 credits per turn)

To generate income, the gang needs to roll a successful **Barter Check**: `dice: (1d6+Gang Leader's Barter Skill) * 10`

The Barter Skill is based on the Gang Leader's Negotiation and Persuasion abilities. If the gang leader has a high Barter Skill, they'll be more effective at negotiating with traders and scavengers to get a better deal.

For example, if the gang leader has a Barter Skill of +2, the roll would be: `dice: (1d6+2) * 10`

The resulting income will be based on the roll, multiplied by 10. A high roll could generate up to 30-40 credits per turn, while a low roll might only yield 10-20 credits.

Remember that controlling Scrapheap Market also comes with its own set of challenges and opportunities, such as dealing with raiders, mutant beasts, and rival gangs trying to muscle in on the market's profits.

## Dice Rolls
Now that we have Scrapheap Market linked to Tech Bazaar, let's determine which scenario to play out. Since we're in a Dominion Campaign, we'll roll 2D6 on the following table:

|  &nbsp;&nbsp;2D6&nbsp;&nbsp; | Result                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| :-------------------------: | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|             2-3               | The player with the greater number of Territories chooses which scenario to play. If both players have the same number of Territories, both players should roll a D6, with the player who rolls the highest choosing. If the scenario dictates there is an attacker and a defender, the player who chose the scenario decides which player will be the attacker and which will be the defender. |

Let's roll the dice:

`dice: 2d6`

Please respond with the result of the dice roll (e.g., "5" or "3+4=7").
