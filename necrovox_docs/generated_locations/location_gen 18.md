## Income
To determine the income generated by controlling the Underhive Smuggler's Den, the gang would need to roll `dice: (2d6) * 10`. This roll would result in a value between 20 and 120 credits, with the potential for a 25% increase due to the territory's bonus. 

If the gang rolls a total of 7 on 2d6, the calculation would be: 

`7 * 10 = 70 credits`

With the 25% increase from the territory's bonus, the income generated would be:
