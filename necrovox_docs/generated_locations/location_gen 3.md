## Description
**Workshop Territory:**
A sprawling complex of makeshift factories and repair shops, the Workshop is a hub of industrial activity in the underhive. The air is thick with the smell of grease, smoke, and ozone as machines hum and whir to life. Shelves upon shelves of salvaged parts and tools line the walls, while workbenches are cluttered with half-finished projects and scraps of metal.

**Special Rule: "Scavenging Opportunities"**

Roll `dice: 1d6` and add the result to your gang's income. This represents the Workshop's ability to scavenge valuable parts and materials from abandoned machinery. You can use this bonus to upgrade equipment, pay off debts, or stockpile credits for future use.

**Boon:** The Workshop has a hidden cache of spare parts and tools, worth 10 credits. You can choose to spend this credit pool as you see fit, whether it's upgrading your gang's arsenal, paying off debts, or simply stockpiling credits for future use.

As the workshop is a hub of industrial activity, there are rumors of underground black markets and shady dealings happening in the shadows. Keep an ear out for whispers of lucrative deals and hidden opportunities, but be cautious not to get caught in the crossfire between rival gangs and corporate interests.

## Special Rules
Here's an updated version of the Workshop territory with special rules:

* *Workshop Territory:*
	+ **Special Rule:** "Defensive Position" - When a rival gang attempts to take control of the Workshop, roll `dice: 1d6` and add the result to your gang's combat strength. This represents the Workshop's defenses, such as barricades and traps, that can hinder the invading gang's advance.
	+ **Special Rule:** "Scavenging Opportunities" - Roll `dice: 1d6` and add the result to your gang's income. This represents the Workshop's ability to scavenge valuable parts and materials from abandoned machinery.

As before, the Archeotek Device house rule still applies, allowing you to upgrade only 3 weapons in your gang's arsenal. The Gambling Den house rule also remains, providing a way for fighters to absolve their debts by paying the Delaque player `dice: D6x10` credits.

## Income
According to the Special Rule "Scavenging Opportunities" for the Workshop territory, you'll need to roll a dice to determine your gang's income.

*Roll `dice: 1d6`*

The result of this roll will be added to your gang's income. This represents the value of the parts and materials scavenged from abandoned machinery in the Workshop.

For example, if the roll is a 4, you'll add 4 credits to your gang's income pool.
