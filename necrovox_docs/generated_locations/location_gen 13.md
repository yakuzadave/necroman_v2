Let's expand on the Narco Den territory:

* **Income Roll:** `dice: 1d6`
The Narco Den is a hub for illicit activities, and as such, it generates income based on the number of fighters present. Each fighter in your gang earns an additional 1-3 credits (roll `dice: 1d6`) when they enter the Narco Den.

* **Description:** The air in this dingy, cramped space is thick with the smell of smoke and cheap thrills. Flickering holographic ads for various drugs and stimulants adorn the walls, while haggling dealers and desperate users mingle in the shadows. The sounds of hushed conversations, rustling packages, and distant sirens create a constant hum of activity.

* **Special Rules:** "Narco Network"
	+ When a fighter in your gang enters the Narco Den, they can choose to spend 1 credit to gain a temporary boost to their combat performance. For the remainder of the turn, this fighter gains +1 to their combat roll.
	+ The Narco Den is a hub for information and rumors about the underhive. Roll `dice: 1d6` to see if you receive a valuable piece of intel or gossip:
		- On a roll of 1-2, you overhear a rumor about an upcoming gang war in a nearby territory.
		- On a roll of 3-4, you gain a lead on a hidden stash of valuable tech or supplies.
		- On a roll of 5-6, you discover the location of a high-stakes game or auction being held by rival gangs.

* **Territory Link:** The Narco Den is connected to the Rusted Reliquary through a network of hidden tunnels and secret passages. Vendors and traders from the Tech Bazaar often visit the Reliquary, seeking out rare parts and scraps to resell in their market stalls. In turn, gang members and dealers from the Narco Den frequent the Reliquary, looking for ways to upgrade their gear or score new supplies.

## Description
Here's an expanded description for the Narco Den:

**Narco Den**
* **Income Roll:** `dice: 1d6`
* **Description:** The air in the Narco Den is thick with the smell of smoke and cheap thrills. Flickering holographic ads for various drugs and stimulants dance across the walls, tempting desperate users to try their latest fix. The sounds of haggling dealers and the rustling of packets fill the air, punctuated by the occasional burst of laughter or argument.

The den is a labyrinthine network of cramped corridors and dimly lit rooms, each one filled with its own brand of vice and temptation. In one corner, a group of users are gathered around a makeshift table, eagerly awaiting their next hit of "Grim Reaper's Kiss" - the latest designer drug to hit the streets. Nearby, a dealer is haggling over the price of a packet of "Screamers" with a desperate user, their faces lit only by the faint glow of their implants.

In another room, a group of gangers are gathered around a makeshift bar, swapping stories and sharing laughs as they pass a bottle of cheap whiskey. The walls are adorned with faded posters and tattered streamers, remnants of some long-forgotten celebration or victory.

* **Special Rules:** "Narco Network"
	+ When a fighter in your gang enters the Narco Den, they can choose to spend 1 credit to gain a temporary boost to their combat performance (see below). This could be anything from a quick fix of adrenaline to a temporary boost in strength or agility.
	+ The Narco Den is a hub for information and rumors about the underhive. Roll `dice: 1d6` to see if you receive a valuable piece of intel or gossip. This could include news of rival gangs, hidden caches of supplies, or even whispers of powerful artifacts hidden deep within the tunnels.

## Income
Let's get started!

For the Narco Den, I'll assume the income roll is `dice: 1d6`. To determine the gang's income generated from controlling this location, they would need to roll a dice and multiply the result by 10.

So, the gang needs to roll:

`dice: 1d6`

The result of the roll will be multiplied by 10 to determine their income.

## Dice Rolls
Let's get started!

To determine the income roll, I'll roll a d6 for you. Here it is:

`dice: 1d6`

Please let me know what kind of gang fighters are present in your gang and which ones would like to take advantage of the Narco Den's boost to combat performance. Additionally, would you like to explore the Narco Den further or focus on other aspects of the territory?
