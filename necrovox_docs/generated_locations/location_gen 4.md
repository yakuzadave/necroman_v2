### Necropolis Catacombs

The Necropolis Catacombs, located beneath the sprawling city of Necromunda, are a labyrinthine network of tunnels and chambers that wind their way through the depths of the Underhive. Serving as the final resting place for generations of the city's deceased, these catacombs are shrouded in darkness and mystery, with the echoes of the past whispering through the cold stone walls.

**Bonus:** Fear and Intimidation Bonus in Battles

Gangs that control the Necropolis Catacombs gain a significant advantage in battles, as the eerie atmosphere and haunting presence of the dead instill fear in their enemies. The mere mention of the catacombs strikes dread into the hearts of rival gangs, weakening their resolve and bolstering the confidence of those who hold sway over this macabre territory.

**Enhanced Bonus:** Access to Necromantic Rituals and Undead Allies

For those daring enough to delve deep into the secrets of the Necropolis Catacombs, the power of necromancy awaits. Through ancient rituals and dark magic, gangs can tap into the forces of death and raise undead allies to fight alongside them in battle. These undead minions, once lifeless husks, now serve their masters with unwavering loyalty, striking fear into the hearts of all who oppose them.

As gangs vie for control of the Necropolis Catacombs, they must navigate treacherous passageways, evade the restless spirits of the dead, and contend with rival factions seeking to harness the power of necromancy for their own ends. Only those who are willing to embrace the darkness and master the art of death will emerge victorious in the Dominion Campaign, shaping the fate of Necromunda with their newfound powers.

## Description
The Necropolis Catacombs, shrouded in perpetual darkness and silence, hold a chilling presence that sends shivers down the spines of those who dare to tread its unhallowed grounds. The dim light of flickering torches barely illuminates the ancient stone walls, adorned with macabre carvings and the faded remnants of funeral rites conducted centuries ago. The distant echoes of dripping water and the faint rustle of unseen movements create an atmosphere of foreboding uncertainty, as if the very walls themselves hold whispered secrets and restless spirits.

The maze-like network of tunnels twists and turns, leading deeper into the bowels of the earth where the air grows colder and the shadows grow thicker. Crypts and mausoleums, some sealed with heavy stone lids bearing the weight of forgotten names, line the passageways like silent sentinels of death. Faint whispers and ghostly apparitions are said to haunt the darker corners of the Catacombs, manifestations of the restless souls trapped within the cold embrace of eternal slumber.

Those who control the Necropolis Catacombs wield a power that transcends mere physical force. The fear and intimidation instilled by the oppressive aura of death that permeates the tunnels can unsettle even the bravest hearts and sow discord among rival gangs. The enhanced bonus of accessing necromantic rituals and raising undead allies elevates the stakes of dominion, as the line between the living and the dead blurs in the pursuit of power and control.

To claim dominion over the Necropolis Catacombs is to walk a dangerous path, where the allure of forbidden knowledge and the temptation of unholy power beckon to those who would risk everything for supremacy in the dark underworld of Necromunda. The echoes of the past and the whispers of the departed echo through the cold stone corridors, promising secrets and treachery to those who dare to seek them out. In the depths of the Catacombs, the fate of gangs and the balance of power hang in the balance, awaiting the bold and the cunning to make their mark on the city's twisted legacy.

### Necropolis Catacombs

The Necropolis Catacombs are a dark and eerie network of underground tunnels and chambers that serve as the final resting place for the city's deceased. The air is thick with the scent of decay and the walls are lined with ancient crypts and mausoleums. 

**Bonus:** Fear and Intimidation Bonus in Battles

**Enhanced Bonus:** Access to Necromantic Rituals and Undead Allies

**Special Rules:**

1. **Undead Guardians:** When defending against a rival gang's attempt to take control of the Necropolis Catacombs, the controlling gang may summon Undead Guardians to aid them in battle. These undead allies are immune to fear and intimidation effects and possess enhanced combat abilities. The number and strength of Undead Guardians summoned is based on the controlling gang's mastery of necromantic rituals.

2. **Cursed Grounds:** The Necropolis Catacombs are imbued with dark magic that curses any who seek to desecrate its sanctity. Rival gangs attempting to seize control of the Catacombs suffer penalties to their combat effectiveness, as the cursed grounds weaken their resolve and abilities.

3. **Ritual of Binding:** The controlling gang may perform a Ritual of Binding to strengthen their hold on the Necropolis Catacombs. This ritual enhances the fear and intimidation bonus granted by the location and solidifies the connection to the dark powers within. However, performing the Ritual of Binding also attracts the attention of malevolent forces that may seek to challenge the gang's dominance.

As gangs clash in the shadows of the Necropolis Catacombs, the echoes of the past and the whispers of the dead shape the outcome of each battle. Only those who can master the dark arts and navigate the treacherous depths of the Catacombs will claim ultimate control and unlock the full potential of this sinister territory in the Dominion Campaign.
