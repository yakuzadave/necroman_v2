## Description
*Toll Crossing**
Location: {{location|gen}}
Income: `dice: (2d6) * 10`
Description:
The Toll Crossing is a notorious hub of activity in the underhive, where gangs and traders come together to negotiate, barter, or simply pass through. The area is characterized by makeshift stalls, crumbling buildings, and a constant hum of activity. It's not uncommon to see rival gangs eyeing each other from opposite sides of the crossing, while others haggle over goods and services.

As you navigate the Toll Crossing, you're constantly aware of the risks and opportunities that come with operating in this high-stakes environment. The Orlock gang, notorious for their ruthless tactics, holds sway over this territory, demanding tolls from gangs looking to pass through or gain priority in battles.

Income:
Roll `dice: (2d6) * 10` to determine your income at the Toll Crossing. On a total of 1-4, you earn 10 credits; on 5-8, you earn 20 credits; and on 9-12, you earn 30 credits.

Special Rules:

* Pay the Orlock gang 20 credits to gain Priority in the first round of any battle.
* Any gang that uses this ability must declare their intention before the battle begins.
* Roll `dice: 1d6` to see if you can make contact with another gang. On a 1-2, you find a minor rival gang; on a 3-4, you meet a neutral trader; and on a 5-6, you encounter a powerful ally.

Boons:

* The Toll Crossing provides a natural gathering point for gangs looking to trade or negotiate with other factions. Roll `dice: 1d6` to see if you can make contact with another gang.
* The location's makeshift market offers limited resources and supplies. Roll `dice: 1d6` to see what you can acquire:
	+ 1-2: A single item from the Trading Post or Black Market
	+ 3-4: A set of common supplies (e.g., medi-kits, ammo)
	+ 5-6: A rare or valuable item

As you operate in this location, be prepared to navigate treacherous alliances, rivalries, and negotiations. The Toll Crossing is a hub of activity, where opportunity and danger lurk around every corner.



## Special Rules
I apologize for the mistake earlier! Here's an updated version of the Toll Crossing location with special rules:

*Toll Crossing** 
Location: {{location|gen}} 
Income: `dice: 2d6` 

The Toll Crossing is a strategic location where gangs can pay a toll to gain priority in the first round of any battle. This territory offers a unique opportunity for gangs to get an early advantage, but at a cost.

Special Rules:

* **Toll Gate**: When another gang attempts to take control of the Toll Crossing, roll `dice: 1d6`. On a 1-2, the defending gang gains Priority in the first round of combat. On a 3-4, the defender gets to set up their fighters first. On a 5-6, the attacker gets to go first.
* **Orlock's Toll**: The Orlock gang controls the Toll Crossing and will not hesitate to defend it against any would-be attackers. If an Orlock gang is defending the location, they gain +1 to their combat rolls.

Boons:

* The Toll Crossing provides a natural gathering point for gangs looking to trade or negotiate with other factions.
* Roll `dice: 1d6` to see if you can make contact with another gang. On a 1-2, you find a minor rival gang; on a 3-4, you meet a neutral trader; and on a 5-6, you encounter a powerful ally.

What would you like to do next?

## Income
*As the controller of the Toll Crossing, your gang can generate income based on the number of fighters deleted during the preceding battle.*

To calculate the income, roll `dice: 1d6` and add +1 for each fighter deleted. The total result is the amount of credits earned.

For example, if you rolled a 4 and had 2 fighters deleted, your income would be:

4 (roll) + 2 (fighters deleted) = 6

So, in this case, your gang would earn 6 credits from controlling the Toll Crossing.

Remember to keep track of your gang's total income and expenses to manage their resources effectively throughout the campaign.
