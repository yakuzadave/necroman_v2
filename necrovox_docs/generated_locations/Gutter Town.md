## Description
**Gutter Town**

Located in the heart of the Underhive, Gutter Town is a labyrinthine network of narrow alleys, crumbling tenements, and makeshift marketplaces. This territory is home to various factions vying for power, from cunning scavengers to ruthless gangs. The air is thick with the smell of smoke, rust, and decay, and the sounds of haggling merchants, blaring loudspeakers, and distant gunfire create a cacophony that never truly fades.

As you navigate the twisting streets and cramped alleys, you'll encounter all manner of characters. Scavengers and traders peddle their wares from makeshift stalls, while gang members from rival factions eye each other with suspicion. The walls are adorned with crude graffiti and faded posters touting the latest in Underhive entertainment: underground wrestling matches, black market tech auctions, and illicit pleasure dens.

**Benefits:**

* **Scavenger's Delight**: Roll 1d6 when searching for resources in Gutter Town; add +1 if you have a Scavenger Expert skill.

* **Marketplace Mayhem**: Once per battle, any fighter with the Scavenger or Trader skills can use the Haggle action to gain a discount on a single item from the Trading Post or Black Market (use the same rules as Tech Bazaar).

**Drawbacks:**

* **Rival Gangs**: Any gang that doesn't control Gutter Town suffers -1 to their Bottle tests against rival gangs in this territory.
* **Toxic Waste**: Roll 1d6 when entering or exiting Gutter Town; on a 4+, a random Toxic Waste hazard appears (use the Hazard Table from the Necromunda Rulebook).

**Special Rules:**

As you explore this treacherous terrain, remember that the Underhive is full of surprises. Will you seize control of Gutter Town and reap its benefits, or will you need to adapt to its dangers? The choice is yours.

Income: dice: 1d6

## Income
According to the Necromunda rulebook, when a gang controls a territory, they earn income based on the territory's value. Gutter Town is considered a "Medium" territory, which means that the gang controlling it earns 10 credits per turn.

To determine the income generated by controlling Gutter Town, you would roll a dice and add the result to the territory's value. In this case:

* Roll: `dice: 1d6`
* Add the result to the territory's value (10 credits): `result + 10`

For example, if you roll a 3 on the dice, your income generated by controlling Gutter Town would be:

* `3 + 10 = 13` credits per turn

So, in this case, the gang controlling Gutter Town would earn 13 credits per turn.
