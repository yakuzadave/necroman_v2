Let's expand on the **Rusted Reliquary** territory:

As you step inside, the creaky door screeches in protest, announcing your arrival to any potential occupants. The air is thick with the smell of rust, decay, and ozone. You notice that the walls are covered in old advertisements for long-defunct companies, their faded logos and slogans a testament to the passage of time.

The main room is a mess of crates, machinery, and broken electronics. It's clear that this place has been abandoned for some time, but you sense that it might have once been a thriving hub of activity. You spot a few scraps of metal, wires, and broken electronics that could be useful for upgrading your gang's gear.

You notice several areas of interest:

* A pile of old crates in the corner, covered in dust and cobwebs. Some of these crates appear to be locked or sealed with rusted padlocks.
* A workbench in the center of the room, cluttered with tools, broken machinery, and scraps of metal. It looks like someone might have been working on a project here recently, but it's unclear what that project was.
* A small office or storage area at the back of the room, filled with old files, dusty containers, and other miscellaneous items.

As you explore the **Rusted Reliquary**, you notice that the place seems to be... watching you. You can't quite put your finger on it, but there's a sense of unease in the air, like someone (or something) is waiting for an opportunity to strike.

## Description
**[Rusted Reliquary]]**
As you push open the creaky door, a musty smell wafts out, carrying with it whispers of forgotten machinery and long-abandoned dreams. The Rusted Reliquary appears to be an old, abandoned scrapyard or salvage yard, its walls lined with crates, machinery, and broken electronics. The air is thick with the stench of decay and neglect, but you sense that there might be something valuable hidden within its walls.

The interior of the Reliquary is a maze of narrow aisles and cramped storage rooms, each one overflowing with discarded goods and scraps of metal. Crates bearing faded labels like "Electronics," "Machinery," and "Miscellaneous" are stacked haphazardly, their contents spilling out onto the floor. Broken machinery and old equipment lie strewn about, covered in rust and cobwebs.

As you navigate the Reliquary's cramped spaces, you notice a few scraps of metal, wires, and broken electronics that could be useful for upgrading your gang's gear. Perhaps you can salvage some valuable components from an old hoverbike or upgrade your gang's weapons with scavenged parts. The vendors at the Tech Bazaar might even be interested in acquiring these items, if you're willing to make a deal.

Rumors swirl about the Reliquary's shady dealings and rough-looking characters lurking in the shadows. Some say that certain vendors at the Tech Bazaar have connections to this place, using it as a front for their more... "interesting" activities. Others whisper about hidden compartments and secrets within the Reliquary's walls, waiting to be uncovered by someone brave (or foolhardy) enough to explore.

## Special Rules

**[Rusted Reliquary]]**
As you leave the bustling market stalls of the Tech Bazaar, you notice a small, rundown shop tucked away in a corner. The sign above the door reads "Rusted Reliquary" in faded letters.

You now have a total of 2.5 credits.
