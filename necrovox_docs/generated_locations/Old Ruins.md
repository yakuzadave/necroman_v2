Let's expand on the Old Ruins territory:

**Old Ruins:**

As you navigate through the dusty tunnels, you notice that the air is thick with the scent of decay and neglect. The walls are cracked and worn, revealing glimpses of ancient machinery and forgotten artifacts. The sound of scavenging creatures echoes through the caverns, from the scuttling of giant spiders to the distant howls of feral dogs.

The terrain is treacherous, with uneven flooring, crumbling supports, and narrow ledges that threaten to collapse at any moment. Visibility is limited due to thick layers of dust and debris, making it difficult to spot potential threats or hidden dangers.

**Connections:**

Old Ruins is connected to the Tech Bazaar through a network of abandoned tunnels and forgotten passageways. These tunnels are treacherous and narrow, requiring gangs to navigate carefully to avoid traps and ambushes. The connection between Old Ruins and the Tech Bazaar is marked by a series of ancient symbols etched into the walls, which seem to pulse with a faint, otherworldly energy.

**Resources:**

Old Ruins holds secrets and treasures from a bygone era, including:

* **Scavenged Goods:** 2D6x5 credits worth of scavenged goods, including discarded tech, abandoned equipment, and forgotten relics.
* **Ancient Artifacts:** 1D6+1 unique artifacts, each with its own hidden properties or boons. These artifacts can be used to upgrade gang fighters, acquire new abilities, or trade for other resources.

**Challenges:**

Old Ruins poses dangers and challenges for any gang that dares to venture into its depths:

* **Traps:** 2D6+1 traps, including falling debris, collapsing tunnels, and hidden pitfalls.
* **Creatures:** 1D6+1 creatures, including giant spiders, feral dogs, and other scavenging beasts.

## Description
Here's an expanded description of the [Old Ruins] territory:

**[Old Ruins]**

As you navigate the crumbling passageways, the air thick with dust and debris, you can't help but feel a sense of unease. The sounds of scavenging creatures echo through the caverns, their whispers and scuttling footsteps punctuating the silence. Crumbling stone walls and ancient machinery lie scattered about, testament to the long-forgotten civilizations that once thrived here.

The Old Ruins are a labyrinthine complex of tunnels, chambers, and ruins, stretching as far as the eye can see. Flickering torches cast eerie shadows on the walls, casting an otherworldly glow over the desolate landscape. Amidst the rubble, you might stumble upon ancient artifacts, forgotten relics, or even hidden caches of valuable resources.

However, be warned: the Old Ruins are treacherous terrain, riddled with hidden dangers and unpredictable hazards. The crumbling structures can collapse at any moment, burying unwary gangs beneath a mountain of debris. And then there are the creatures that lurk in the shadows â€“ twisted, mutated beasts that have adapted to this harsh environment.

Despite these risks, the Old Ruins hold secrets and treasures waiting to be uncovered. Rumors whisper of ancient technology hidden deep within the ruins, capable of granting unparalleled power or unlocking new technologies. Others speak of forgotten artifacts, imbued with mystical properties or holding the key to unlocking long-lost knowledge.

## Special Rules
Let's define some special rules for Old Ruins.

**Old Ruins Special Rules:**

* **Treacherous Terrain:** When a gang attempts to take control of Old Ruins, they must make a Difficult (+1) test to navigate the treacherous tunnels and avoid hazards. Failure means 1D6 fighters are lost in the ruins and cannot participate in combat for the rest of the turn.
* **Scavenger's Delight:** If a gang is already controlling Old Ruins when another gang attempts to take it, they gain +1 Reputation (T) for each fighter they have in the location. This bonus can be used during the subsequent battle.

These special rules aim to reflect the dangers and challenges of navigating the Old Ruins, as well as the potential benefits of being already established in the location.

## Linked Territories
I apologize for the mistake! Here's the corrected response:

[Old Ruins] -> [Tech Bazaar]

Let's create a new territory linked to the Tech Bazaar. I choose option 3: **Ash Wastes Nomad**.

As we apply this option, Replaced by Old Ruins becomes unclaimed (if not already), and gain 4D6x10.

The new territory is:

[Old Ruins]
This territory is connected to the [Tech Bazaar] through a network of abandoned tunnels and forgotten passageways. The air is thick with dust and debris, and the sounds of scavenging creatures echo through the caverns. Old Ruins holds secrets and treasures from a bygone era, but also poses dangers and challenges for any gang that dares to venture into its depths.
