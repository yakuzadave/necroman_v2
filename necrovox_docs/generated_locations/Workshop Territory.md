## Description
*Workshop Territory**
Location Description:
The Workshop is a sprawling complex of abandoned factories, rusting machinery, and scavenged parts. Your gang has claimed this territory as their own, using it as a hub for repairs, maintenance, and even occasional manufacturing. The air is thick with the smell of oil, smoke, and burning metal.

As you enter the Workshop, you're immediately struck by the sheer scale of the operation. Cranes and pulleys stretch across the ceiling, while rows upon rows of workbenches and tool racks line the walls. In the center of the complex, a large assembly line hums with activity, as gang members busily repair and modify equipment.

To one side, you'll find the Scrapyard, where your gang's engineers and tinkerers sort through discarded machinery and salvageable parts. The air is thick with the smell of rust and oil, and the sound of metal being cut and shaped fills the air. Here, you can find everything from old power armor to broken-down vehicles, all waiting to be repurposed or sold.

On the opposite side of the Workshop lies the Fabrication area, where your gang's most skilled engineers work their magic. This is where they take scraps and salvageable parts and turn them into new, functional equipment. The smell of welding sparks and hot metal fills the air as they shape and mold raw materials into something new.
