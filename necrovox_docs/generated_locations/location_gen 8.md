The Rusted Reliquary, a treasure trove of ancient secrets and mysterious machinery. As you enter this crumbling temple, the air thick with dust and decay, you can't help but feel the weight of history bearing down upon you.

As you make your way deeper into the temple, you notice that the walls are adorned with strange symbols etched into the stone. These markings seem to pulse with a faint, otherworldly energy, as if they're trying to convey some long-forgotten message. The flickering candles cast eerie shadows on the walls, making it seem like the very spirits of the ancient cultists are watching your every move.

The central chamber is dominated by a large, ornate door that appears to lead deeper into the structure. This door is adorned with intricate carvings and symbols, which seem to be some sort of lock or puzzle. Solving this puzzle could grant access to hidden areas or reveal ancient secrets, but it's clear that the Goliath Gang has taken great care to keep this door sealed.

Scattered throughout the temple are ancient machines that can be used to repair or upgrade equipment. These machines seem to be in various states of disrepair, but with some tinkering and experimentation, they could provide valuable resources for your gang. You also notice that the walls contain hidden compartments containing valuable resources and clues to unlocking deeper areas.

As you explore the temple, you come across remnants of the ancient cult, including strange artifacts and cryptic texts. These relics hold secrets to unlocking new abilities or revealing hidden truths about the underhive. However, be warned: these relics are also coveted by rival gangs, who will stop at nothing to claim them for themselves.

The Rusted Reliquary is connected to the Tech Bazaar territory through a network of ancient tunnels and hidden passages. Gangs that control the Tech Bazaar can use these connections to gain access to the temple, but beware - rival gangs may also be seeking to claim this territory for themselves.

To take control of this territory, you will need to defeat the Goliath Gang in combat or negotiate a deal with them to gain access. The Goliath Gang is notorious for their cunning and ruthlessness, so be prepared for a fight that will test your mettle.

Rolling for scenario: 1d6... *rolls* The result is... **Territory**! It seems we have a new territory to explore and conquer!

What would you like to do first? Do you want to try and negotiate with the Goliath Gang, or do you want to launch a full-scale assault on the temple?

## Description
The Rusted Reliquary, a temple of ancient secrets and forgotten lore. As you step into the crumbling structure, the air thickens with the weight of centuries of neglect and decay. The flickering candles cast eerie shadows on the walls, making it seem as though the very spirits of the underhive are watching your every move.

The central chamber is dominated by the ornate door, adorned with strange symbols that seem to pulse with a malevolent energy. The air is heavy with the scent of dust and decay, and the sound of creaking wooden beams echoes through the temple like the whispers of the damned.

As you explore the temple, you come across ancient machinery scattered throughout the halls. These relics of a bygone era can be used to repair or upgrade your equipment, but beware - they may also hold secrets that are better left unspoken.

The walls of the temple seem to writhe and twist, as if alive, and hidden compartments contain valuable resources and cryptic texts that may hold the key to unlocking deeper areas. But you're not alone in this temple - remnants of the ancient cult still linger, their presence felt but unseen.

The Goliath Gang, ruthless and cunning, has claimed the Rusted Reliquary as their own. They patrol the temple's corridors with an iron fist, seeking out any who would dare to challenge their dominance. To take control of this territory, you'll need to defeat them in combat or negotiate a deal that suits your interests.

As you navigate the treacherous halls of the Rusted Reliquary, you begin to uncover the secrets of the ancient cult. The symbols etched into the walls seem to hold a dark power, one that could grant unimaginable strength and cunning to those who wield it. But at what cost?

The temple's hidden passages and tunnels connect it to the Tech Bazaar territory, offering a path for gangs seeking to expand their influence. However, rival gangs may also be seeking to claim this territory for themselves, and the Goliath Gang will not hesitate to defend its turf.

What do you want to do in the Rusted Reliquary?

Rolling for initiative: 1d6... *rolls* The result is... **Initiative**! You get to decide how to proceed.

## Special Rules
Excellent work on creating the Rusted Reliquary territory!

To add some special rules to this territory, I'll introduce a few unique mechanics that will impact combat scenarios:

**Rusted Reliquary Special Rules:**

1. **Cursed Ground:** The temple's ancient machinery and cultist remnants have imbued the ground with a strange, malevolent energy. When a gang attempts to take control of the Rusted Reliquary through combat, roll an additional dice (1d6) for each model involved in the fight. If the result equals or exceeds the number of models on the opposing side, the cursed ground has a 50% chance of causing one model on the attacking gang's side to become "Cursed." The Cursed model must spend its next activation trying to remove the curse (see below).
2. **Curse Removal:** A Cursed model can attempt to remove the curse by spending an entire activation (no other actions are allowed during this turn). Roll a dice (1d6) and add 1 for each model within 3" of the Cursed model that is not Cursed. If the total equals or exceeds 5, the curse is lifted.
3. **Ancient Defenses:** The temple's walls and machinery can be used to defend against invaders. When a gang attempts to take control of the Rusted Reliquary through combat, roll an additional dice (1d6) for each model on the defending side (Goliath Gang). If the result equals or exceeds the number of models on the opposing side, the ancient defenses trigger, causing 1 damage to each model on the attacking gang's side.
4. **Hidden Compartments:** During combat, there is a 20% chance that a hidden compartment will open, revealing a valuable resource (e.g., ammo, medkits, or equipment) that can be used by either side.

These special rules add an extra layer of complexity and challenge to combat scenarios in the Rusted Reliquary territory. The cursed ground, curse removal, ancient defenses, and hidden compartments all contribute to making this territory a unique and thrilling place to explore and conquer!

## Boons
The Rusted Reliquary, a fascinating addition to the underhive's complex web of territories. As the Goliath Gang controls this temple, they've managed to scavenge some valuable resources and secrets within its crumbling walls.

**Goliath Gang Boons:**

* **Ancient Knowledge:** The Goliath Gang has access to ancient texts and artifacts hidden within the temple, granting them insight into the underhive's dark history. This knowledge can be used to gain an advantage in negotiations or uncover hidden secrets.
* **Machine Salvage:** The gang can salvage ancient machinery to repair or upgrade their equipment, giving them a technological edge over rival gangs.
* **Cultist Allies:** The remnants of the ancient cult still lingering within the temple may offer their services to the Goliath Gang, providing them with cryptic information and mysterious abilities.

As the scenario unfolds, you find yourself standing before the ornate door at the heart of the Rusted Reliquary. The air is thick with anticipation as you prepare to face off against the Goliath Gang's leader, a towering figure known only as "The Unyielding."

**Combat Encounter:**

* **Goliath Gang Leader (The Unyielding):** WS 4+, BS 3+, S 5, T 6, W 10
* **Goliath Gang Grunts:** WS 2+, BS 1+, S 3, T 4, W 5

To take control of the Rusted Reliquary, you'll need to defeat The Unyielding and his grunts in combat. Roll for initiative: `dice: 1d6`

## Income
The Rusted Reliquary, a treasure trove of ancient secrets and rusty machinery!

As the controller of this territory, the Goliath Gang can generate income through scavenging for valuable resources within the temple. The gang's income is determined by rolling:

`dice: (1d6) * 10`

This will give them a base income of 10-60 credits per turn, depending on the roll.

To determine their actual income, the Goliath Gang must make a successful Wargear skill test (lower numbers are better). If they succeed, they can add the result to their base income. For example:

`dice: (1d6) + 3`

If the gang fails the test, they'll only receive their base income.

As the controller of this territory, the Goliath Gang will need to defend it against rival gangs and scavengers seeking to claim its riches for themselves. Will you be able to hold onto this valuable territory?

## Dice Rolls
The Rusted Reliquary, a treasure trove of ancient secrets and mysterious artifacts. The Goliath Gang's stronghold, no less.

As we begin our scenario in the Rusted Reliquary, let's roll for income:

`dice: 1d6`

Please roll a d6 to determine how much income your gang will receive from this territory. Remember, the lower the number, the better it is.

Once you've rolled, I'll help guide you through the scenario and provide opportunities for your gang to grow and thrive in this new territory.
