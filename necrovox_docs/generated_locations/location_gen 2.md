#Abandoned Factory Complex
## Description
The Abandoned Factory Complex is a sprawling industrial area on the outskirts of the underhive. The complex was once a thriving manufacturing hub, but has since been abandoned and left to decay. Despite its neglect, the factory still holds many valuable scraps and salvageable parts that can be sold or traded.

## Special Rules
* The complex is heavily guarded by rival gangs and factions, making it difficult for your gang to infiltrate without attracting unwanted attention.
* The factory's labyrinthine layout makes it easy to get lost, increasing the chances of encountering random events or encounters.
