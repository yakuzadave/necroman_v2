## Description
*Territory Description: "The Redacted Wastes"*

Welcome to the Redacted Wastes, a medium-sized territory that lies at the heart of the Necromunda's Underhive. This forsaken land is a maze of abandoned factories, narrow tunnels, and crater lakes, all scarred by the ravages of time and war.

**Abandoned Factory: "The Rusty Spire"**

Standing tall amidst the ruins is the Rusty Spire, a once-mighty factory that now serves as a testament to the Underhive's decay. The structure's crumbling walls are pockmarked with bullet holes and scorch marks, while its rusting machinery lies still, like skeletal fingers grasping for the sky. The Spire's central courtyard is a hub of activity, where gangs can gather to plan their next move or trade goods.

**Narrow Tunnels: "The Rat Runs"**

Winding through the territory are the Rat Runs, narrow tunnels that crisscross beneath the surface like a network of underground arteries. These tunnels provide some protection from enemy gangs and offer hidden pathways for gang members to move undetected. However, they also limit visibility and movement, making it difficult to navigate or launch surprise attacks.

**Crater Lake: "The Toxic Tarn"**

At the heart of the Redacted Wastes lies the Toxic Tarn, a massive crater lake that's become a natural obstacle in the territory. The water is murky and contaminated, but it can provide a safe haven for gang members seeking refuge from the dangers above. Be cautious, however â€“ the Tarn's toxic waters may have unforeseen consequences for those who drink from its depths.

**Tainted Water: A Boon and a Curse**

The Toxic Tarn's tainted water is both a boon and a curse. On one hand, it can quench the thirst of gang members and provide a source of hydration in this desolate environment. On the other hand, drinking from the Tarn may lead to negative effects, such as reduced combat effectiveness or increased vulnerability to disease.

**Income: 10 Credits per Turn**

The Redacted Wastes generate an average income of 10 credits per turn, which can be used to recruit new gang members, upgrade equipment, or bribe rival gangs. This income is steady but not spectacular, reflecting the territory's harsh environment and limited resources.

Now that you've got a better sense of this Underhive territory, what would you like to do first? Will you focus on expanding your gang's influence, recruiting new members, or seeking out lucrative opportunities in this unforgiving environment?

## Special Rules
Let me re-generate the territory with a new set of special rules.

*Territory Generation*
To determine the size and shape of the territory, I'll roll a dice:

`dice: 1d6`

The result is... 4! According to the Necromunda rules, this indicates a "Medium" sized territory with a mix of open spaces and obstacles.
Next, I'll generate some terrain features. For each feature, I'll roll a dice:

`dice: 1d6`

Here are the results:

* First feature: **Abandoned Factory** (rolled a 5) - This will be a large structure in the territory that can provide cover or serve as a hub for gang activities.
* Second feature: **Narrow Tunnels** (rolled a 2) - These tunnels will crisscross the territory, providing some protection from enemy gangs but also limiting movement and visibility.
* Third feature: **Crater Lake** (rolled a 6) - This large crater will be a natural obstacle that can provide a safe haven or serve as a gathering point for gang members.

Now, let's determine the Special Rules for this territory. I'll roll another dice:

`dice: 1d6`

The result is... 4! According to the Necromunda rules, this indicates "Tunnel Wars" special rules, which affect combat scenarios in the following way:

* **Tunnel Warfare**: When a gang tries to take control of the territory by assaulting the Abandoned Factory or Crater Lake, the combat becomes more intense and chaotic. Both gangs gain +1 to their WS (Wounds) rolls for the first turn of combat.
* **Narrow Tunnels**: Gangs that engage in combat within the Narrow Tunnels must make a Leadership test to avoid getting disoriented and losing their way. If they fail, they become Shaken and must retreat 6 inches.

These special rules will affect combat scenarios involving the Orlocks and Van Saars as they try to take control of this territory. What would you like to do first?

## Income
According to the Necromunda rules, the gang can generate income from controlling a location based on its reputation level and the number of enemy gangs present in the territory.

For this Underhive territory, since both Orlocks and Van Saars are present, we'll use the "Multi-Gang" rule. The gang's income is determined by rolling a dice:

`dice: 1d6 + (Reputation Level - Number of Enemy Gangs)`

Let's calculate the income for each gang:

* Orlocks (Reputation Level: +1, Number of Enemy Gangs: 1):
	+ Roll: `dice: 1d6`
	+ Income: 10 + (1 - 1) = 9 credits per turn
* Van Saars (Reputation Level: +2, Number of Enemy Gangs: 1):
	+ Roll: `dice: 1d6`
	+ Income: 15 + (2 - 1) = 16 credits per turn

So, the Orlocks can generate an average income of 9 credits per turn, while the Van Saars can generate an average income of 16 credits per turn.
