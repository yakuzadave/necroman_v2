Here's an expanded version of the Scavenger's Scrapyard territory, linked to the Tech Bazaar:

**Scavenger's Scrapyard**
Located just a few blocks away from the bustling Tech Bazaar, the Scavenger's Scrapyard is a sprawling complex of rusting hulks, twisted metal, and hissing steam pipes. The air is thick with the smell of oil, grease, and ozone, as scavengers and traders go about their business.

As you make your way through the yard, you notice that the scavengers are working on a large, mysterious device. It's unclear what it does or who they're building it for, but it looks like it might be worth a pretty penny to the right buyer. The device is surrounded by various tools and machinery, including welding torches, hydraulic pumps, and industrial-grade drills.

The scrapyard itself is divided into several sections, each specializing in different types of salvage. There's the "Machinery Mound," where you can find everything from old generators to working forklifts. Next to it lies the "Metal Maze," a labyrinthine collection of twisted metal pipes, girders, and beams that might be useful for building or repairing structures.

Nearby, the "Electronics Emporium" is filled with all manner of salvaged electronics, from old computer components to working televisions. And in the heart of the scrapyard, the "Gear Grinder" is a massive pile of discarded machinery parts, waiting to be sorted and sold.

Rolling for income: `dice: 1d6`

Result: **3**

You earn 3 credits from the scrapyard vendors and traders. You can use these credits to acquire new gear, upgrade your existing equipment, or simply stash them away for later.

Do you want to:

A) Approach the scavengers' workbench to see what they're working on
B) Ask around about the mysterious device and who might be interested in buying it
C) Head back to the Tech Bazaar to see if anyone's looking for a piece of machinery or parts
D) Leave the scrapyard and explore other parts of the underhive

## Description
Here is an expanded description for the Scavenger's Scrapyard:

**Scavenger's Scrapyard**

As you step into the Scavenger's Scrapyard, the cacophony of sounds and smells envelops you. The air is thick with the acrid smell of rust and oil, mingling with the sweet tang of ozone from the nearby electrical workbenches. The ground beneath your feet is a maze of twisted metal and broken machinery, with scraps of wire and torn fabric scattered about like confetti.

To one side, a group of scavengers are busy dismantling an old generator, their tools clattering against the metal as they extract usable parts. Nearby, another team is working on a mysterious device - a tangle of copper wires, brass pipes, and gleaming steel components that seems to be taking shape before your very eyes.

The scrapyard's vendors and traders are scattered throughout the yard, haggling over prices and making deals in hushed tones. Some are selling off salvaged goods from the underhive's many wars and conflicts, while others are peddling their own wares - makeshift tools, jury-rigged gadgets, and even the occasional piece of rare or valuable tech.

As you explore the scrapyard, keep an ear out for whispers about rumors and gossip. You might overhear mention of a new gang moving into the area, or rumors of a hidden cache of valuable tech buried deep within the underhive. The Scavenger's Scrapyard is a hub of illicit activity, where information flows like water through the pipes.

**Income:** 3 credits

## Special Rules
Let's create a new territory linked to the Tech Bazaar.

*Scavenger's Scrapyard** [linked to Tech Bazaar]
Special Rules: **Scrapyard Scramble**

When a gang attempts to take control of Scavenger's Scrapyard, the following special rules apply:

1. **Rusty Defenses**: The scrapyard's makeshift defenses (barriers, traps, and turrets) are jury-rigged and unreliable. Any gang attempting to take control must roll a 5+ on their Combat Skill test to successfully navigate the defenses.
2. **Scavenger Swarms**: A swarm of scavengers will emerge from the shadows to harass any gang trying to take control. These scavengers have a Combat Skill of 4+ and can move through the scrapyard without penalty.

As you make your way through the yard, you notice that the scavengers seem to be working on a large, mysterious device. It's unclear what it does or who they're building it for, but it looks like it might be worth a pretty penny.

## Income
Let's establish the income rules for the Scavenger's Scrapyard.

**Scrapyard Income**

The gang controlling the Scavenger's Scrapyard can generate income by selling off salvaged parts and machinery to other traders and vendors. The amount of income generated depends on the gang's reputation, the quality of their scavenged goods, and the demand for those goods in the underhive.

**Income Roll**

To determine the scrapyard's income, roll:

`dice: (1d6 + 2) * 10`

This roll takes into account the gang's reputation and the quality of their scavenged goods. The result will be multiplied by 10 to give the total amount of credits earned.

For example, if the roll is `4`, the scrapyard would earn:

`4 * 10 = 40 credits`

The gang can use this income to acquire new gear, upgrade their existing equipment, or stash it away for later.
