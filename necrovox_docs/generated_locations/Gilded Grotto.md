## Description
**Territory 1:** The upscale shopping district of "Gilded Grotto" (dice: 1d6 = 4)

The Gilded Grotto is a luxurious shopping district that caters to the Van Saars' refined tastes. This territory is filled with high-end boutiques, exclusive clubs, and opulent restaurants. The streets are lined with ornate fountains, marble statues, and gleaming chrome accents, creating an atmosphere of elegance and sophistication.

The Grotto is a hotspot for the Van Saars to showcase their wealth and status. They can host lavish parties, flaunt their latest acquisitions, and network with influential figures from across the hive. The district's upscale clientele also provides a steady stream of income through commissions, tips, and discreet transactions.

Income: +10 (rolled 4 on the dice)

**Territory 2:** The Van Saars' family estate, "Manor House" (dice: 1d6 = 3)

The Manor House is the Van Saars' ancestral home, a symbol of their wealth, power, and prestige. This territory serves as a hub for the gang's operations, providing a secure location to plan and coordinate their activities.

The estate itself is a grandiose structure with ornate gardens, sweeping staircases, and lavish furnishings. The Manor House also houses a private library, a state-of-the-art communication network, and a discreet armory. The Van Saars can use this territory to receive guests, host meetings, or simply enjoy the finer things in life.

Reputation Bonus: When dealing with other gangs or authorities that value social standing, the Van Saars gain a +1 bonus to their Reputation.

**Territory 3:** The seedy underbelly of "Rats' Warren" (dice: 1d6 = 5)

Rats' Warren is a dark, cramped alleyway that seems to writhe and twist like a living entity. This territory is home to shady characters, illicit activities, and the Van Saars' more... unsavory connections.

The Warren is a hotbed of corruption, black markets, and underground deals. The Van Saars can use this territory to gather intel on rival gangs, acquire contraband goods, or make discreet arrangements with other underworld figures. However, the risks are high, and the consequences of being caught are severe.

Income: +5 (rolled 5 on the dice)

These territories will serve as the foundation for the Van Saars' operations in the Dominion campaign. With their "High-Society" reputation and "Well-Connected" boon, they're well-positioned to navigate the complex web of alliances, rivalries, and backroom deals that define life in Necromunda.
