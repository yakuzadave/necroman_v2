## Description
* *The Abyssal Depths** *
Location Type: Territory
Income: `dice: 2d6`
The Abyssal Depths are a treacherous and unforgiving territory, characterized by narrow tunnels, toxic waste, and unpredictable gas pockets. This territory is perfect for gangs that thrive in chaos and uncertainty.

As you venture into The Abyssal Depths, the air grows thick with noxious fumes and the sound of dripping water echoes through the tunnels. The walls are slick with oil and grime, making every step a precarious balance between slipping and falling or getting stuck in the narrow passages. The darkness is only illuminated by the faint glow of luminescent fungi growing on the walls, casting an eerie light on the desolate landscape.

The Abyssal Depths are home to all manner of twisted creatures that have adapted to this harsh environment. Giant worms burrow through the tunnels, their segmented bodies writhing like living serpents. Packs of razor-toothed grotto rats scavenge for scraps in the shadows, while massive, tentacled abominations lurk in the deeper recesses, waiting to snatch unsuspecting prey.

Special Rules:

* *Toxic Waste**: Roll a `dice: 1d6` to determine the amount of toxic waste your gang encounters each turn. On a roll of 1-2, your gang suffers a -10% penalty to income. On a roll of 3-4, your gang gains a +5% bonus to combat rolls in close quarters (e.g., tunnels, narrow corridors). On a roll of 5-6, your gang encounters no toxic waste.
* **Gas Pocket**: There is a 20% chance that your gang will encounter a gas pocket during exploration. Roll a `dice: 1d6` and add the result to the roll. If the total equals or exceeds 7, your gang suffers a -10% penalty to income for the turn.

Boons:

* *Scavenging*: Your gang can scavenge for valuable resources in The Abyssal Depths. Roll a `dice: 1d6` and add the result to your gang's income.
* **Tunnel Network**: Your gang has access to a network of tunnels that allows them to move quickly and quietly through the territory. Add +2 to all exploration rolls.

Special Rules:

**Gas Pocket Gauntlet**: When a rival gang attempts to take control of The Abyssal Depths, there is a 30% chance that they will trigger a gas pocket. Roll a `dice: 1d6` and add the result to the roll. If the total equals or exceeds 7, the rival gang must make a combat test at -2 to avoid being pushed back by the toxic fumes.
**Tunnel Tussle**: When engaging in combat within The Abyssal Depths, all fighters gain +1 to their combat rolls due to the narrow tunnels and unpredictable terrain. However, if the gang attempting to take control of the location is forced to retreat, they must make a morale test at -2 or risk losing 10% of their gang's strength.

## Income
As the controller of The Abyssal Depths, your gang earns a base income of 15 credits per turn.

However, due to the toxic waste and gas pockets in the territory, there's an element of uncertainty when it comes to generating income. To determine your actual income for the turn, roll a `dice: 1d6` and add the result to the base income:

* If the total equals or exceeds 18, you earn the full base income of 15 credits.
* If the total is 17 or lower, you suffer a -10% penalty to your income, earning only 13.5 credits (15 x 0.9).
* If the total is 19 or higher, you gain a +5% bonus to your income, earning 15.75 credits (15 x 1.05).

Remember, this income is generated in addition to any other sources of income your gang may have, such as selling goods or services to other gangs.

Now that we have the income rules established, what would you like to do next?
