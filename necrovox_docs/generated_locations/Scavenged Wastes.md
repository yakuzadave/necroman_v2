## Description
*Scavenged Wastes (Combat Territory)*
Location Type: Combat Territory
Income: `dice: 1d6`
Description:
The Scavenged Wastes are a vast expanse of rubble and debris, stretching as far as the eye can see. This once-thriving industrial zone has been reduced to a desolate wasteland, where only the hardiest of scavengers dare to tread. The Marauders have claimed this territory as their own, and it serves as a key location for gathering resources and information.

The air is thick with the acrid smell of burning plastics and ozone, and the ground is treacherous with twisted metal and broken glass. Crumbling buildings loom in the distance, their walls cracked and worn from years of neglect. Amidst this devastation, the Marauders have set up makeshift camps and scavenging operations, using the terrain to their advantage.

Income:
Roll a `dice: 1d6` to determine how much income the Marauders earn from the Scavenged Wastes. On a roll of:

* 1-2: The Marauders earn 10 credits.
* 3-4: The Marauders earn 20 credits and gain access to a valuable piece of scavenged tech (choose one: +1 to Initiative, +1 to Weapon Skill, or +1 to Leadership).
* 5-6: The Marauders earn 30 credits and gain access to a rare resource (choose one: Promethium, Synth-Flesh, or Scrap Metal).

Special Rules:

* *Scavenger's Delight*: Roll a 5 or higher on the dice to gain an additional 10 credits.
* **Debris Field**: Gang members within this territory gain +1 to their Initiative when engaging in combat.
* **Rubble Run**: The terrain of the Scavenged Wastes allows for quick movement and repositioning. When moving through this territory, you can move an extra space without taking a penalty.

As the Marauders, you have a unique opportunity to utilize the Scavenged Wastes as a hub for your operations. With its valuable resources and strategic location, this territory is ripe for exploitation. What will you do with this key location?
