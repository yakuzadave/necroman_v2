## Description
**Ravenhurst Ruins**

Located in the outer rim of the underhive, Ravenhurst Ruins is a sprawling complex of crumbling buildings, overgrown with vines and fungus. The once-thriving settlement has been reduced to a mere shadow of its former self, with twisted metal beams and cracked concrete slabs forming the skeletal remains of what was once a thriving metropolis.

**Income:** `dice: 1d6` (3-5 credits per turn)

The ruins themselves provide a moderate income to the gang that occupies them, worth 3-5 credits per turn. The exact amount is determined by rolling a d6 and adding the result to the territory's standard income.

**Special Ability:** "Scavenger's Delight"

When a gang occupies Ravenhurst Ruins, they can choose to deploy an additional fighter in the next battle, as long as they have sufficient points available. This ability is unique to Ravenhurst Ruins and cannot be used elsewhere on the underhive map.

**Terrain Features:**

* **Crumbling Buildings:** The ruins are filled with crumbling buildings that can provide cover for fighters. However, these structures are unstable and may collapse during combat, causing damage to both sides.
* **Overgrown Passages:** Narrow passages filled with vines and fungus make it difficult for fighters to move quickly through the area. Roll a `dice: 1d6` when entering or exiting Ravenhurst Ruins; on a roll of 4-6, the fighter is slowed by 1 turn due to the dense foliage.

**Territory Objective:**

* **Control:** The objective of this territory is to control as much of the ruins as possible. The gang with the most fighters occupying the ruins earns bonus income and reputation points.
* **Reputation Points:** +2 reputation points for every turn a gang controls Ravenhurst Ruins.

**Notes:**

This territory is designed to be a mid-level challenge, providing some benefits but also presenting obstacles through its terrain features. Van Saar's reputation bonus will likely serve them well in this area, while Orlock's priority advantage could help them capitalize on the initial combat round. Cawdor's corpse farm income might not be as effective in Ravenhurst Ruins due to the moderate income provided by the territory.

**Special Rules and Boons:**

* **Collapse:** When combat occurs in Ravenhurst Ruins, roll a `dice: 1d6` at the start of the battle. On a roll of 4-6, one random building collapses, causing damage to both sides (1 point each).
* **Scavenger's Bounty:** When a gang occupies Ravenhurst Ruins, they earn an additional `dice: 1d4` credits per turn. This bonus is in addition to the territory's standard income.
* **Fungal Growth:** Roll a `dice: 1d6` when entering or exiting Ravenhurst Ruins. On a roll of 4-6, a fungal growth blocks the way, causing all fighters attempting to move through the area to become slowed by 1 turn.

These special rules and boons add an extra layer of complexity and challenge to Ravenhurst Ruins, making it a more interesting and dynamic territory for your Necromunda campaign.

## Income
According to the original description, Ravenhurst Ruins provides a moderate income to the gang that occupies it, worth 5 credits per turn.

To determine the actual income generated, you can use the following formula:

Income = 5 (base income) + `dice: 1d4`

This means that the gang will earn a base income of 5 credits per turn, and then roll a d4 to add an additional amount. The rolled value can be used to purchase upgrades or equipment for their fighters.

For example, if the gang rolls a 2 on the d4, their total income would be 7 credits (5 + 2). If they roll a 3, their total income would be 8 credits (5 + 3), and so on.
