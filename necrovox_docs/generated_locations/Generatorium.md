## Description
***Generatorium***

You've taken control of the Generatorium, a sprawling industrial complex that hums with the constant thrum of machinery. The air is thick with the smell of ozone and burning wire as sparks fly from the countless devices scattered throughout the area. The Generatorium is a hub of activity, with gangs vying for control of this vital resource.

As you explore the Generatorium, you notice the sheer scale of the operation. Rows upon rows of humming generators line the walls, providing power to the surrounding districts. Crates and boxes filled with spare parts, wiring, and other components are stacked haphazardly, waiting to be claimed by scavengers or repurposed for the gang's own needs.

The Generatorium is also home to a variety of skilled workers and engineers who can be hired to perform tasks such as repairing equipment, crafting new tools, or even constructing makeshift defenses. These experts are scattered throughout the complex, often working in cramped, dimly lit spaces filled with machinery and wires.

However, the Generatorium is not without its dangers. Rival gangs are constantly trying to sabotage the generators, steal valuable components, or even hijack entire sections of the complex for their own purposes. You'll need to keep a close eye on your resources and income, as well as be prepared to defend yourself against these threats.

**Income:**
To determine your income, roll `dice: 1d6`. On a roll of:

* 1-2: You receive 10 Credits.
* 3-4: You receive 15 Credits.
* 5-6: You receive 20 Credits.

**Special Rules/Boons:**

* **Electricity Surge:** Once per turn, you can reroll a dice roll made for your gang members within the Generatorium. This can be used to re-roll combat rolls, skill tests, or any other dice roll.
* **Scavenging Opportunities:** The Generatorium provides an abundance of scrap metal and machinery. You can use this to repair equipment, craft new tools, or even construct makeshift defenses. Roll `dice: 1d6` to see what you find:
	+ 1-2: A broken machine that can be repaired for 5 Credits.
	+ 3-4: A piece of scrap metal that can be used as a makeshift shield.
	+ 5-6: A working machine that provides an additional +1 to your gang's combat rolls.

## Income
I apologize for the mistake earlier! As the Generatorium, your gang's income is directly tied to the success of the generator.

* 1-2: You receive 5 Credits.
* 3-4: You receive 10 Credits.

This income is generated from the sale of surplus energy and resources harvested from the Generatorium. As the gang in control, you'll need to manage the generator's output and ensure it remains operational to maximize your income.
