Let's dive deeper into the Scavenger's Warren.

**[Scavenger's Warren]]**
This territory is a labyrinthine network of narrow alleys, cramped market stalls, and hidden passageways. The air is thick with the smell of oil, rust, and desperation as scavengers and traders eke out a living by salvaging valuable scraps from the ruins above.

The walls are adorned with flickering lanterns, casting eerie shadows on the rough-hewn stone floor. The Warren's maze-like layout makes it difficult to navigate, even for those who know its secrets. Hidden corners and secret chambers contain all manner of treasures and trinkets, from rare components to stolen goods and illicit information.

The Scavenger's Warren is connected to the Tech Bazaar through a network of hidden tunnels and narrow passages. This connection allows for the free flow of goods, services, and information between the two territories. However, this proximity also breeds competition among rival scavengers and traders vying for control of the territory.

**Resources:**

* 1x Palanite Enforcer (patrolling the Warren): A loyal servant of the Palanite Enforcers, this enforcer is tasked with maintaining order in the Scavenger's Warren. They can be persuaded to work for your gang or provide valuable information.
* 1x Archaeotech Device (hidden in a secret chamber): This ancient device holds secrets and power. It could be used to enhance your gang's abilities or traded on the black market.

**Challenges:**

* The Warren is infested with gangs of vicious rat-kin, who prey on unwary visitors. These rodents are notorious for their cunning and ferocity.
* A rival gang, the "Rust Riders," has set up shop in the Warren and is actively seeking to undermine your operations. They're a ruthless bunch, and you'll need to be prepared to defend yourself.

**Gangs:**

* The Scavenger's Guild: A loose network of scavengers and traders who control much of the Warren's commerce.
* The Rat-Kin Cartel: A gang of vicious rat-kin who prey on unwary visitors and control certain areas of the Warren.
* The Rust Riders: A rival gang seeking to undermine your operations in the Scavenger's Warren.

Which approach will you take? Will you try to negotiate with the Rust Riders or take them down through force? Or perhaps you'll focus on exploiting the Archaeotech Device for its secrets and power?

Please respond with one of the following options:

1. Roll 2D6 to determine which scenario unfolds.
2. Use Goonhammer's suggested scenario table for a different approach.
3. Choose a specific resource or scenario to start with.

Remember, in Necromunda, skills are better when they're lower!

## Description
Let me expand on the Scavenger's Warren:

**[Scavenger's Warren]]**
This territory is a labyrinthine network of narrow alleys and cramped market stalls, where scavengers and traders eke out a living by salvaging valuable scraps from the ruins above. The air is thick with the smell of oil, rust, and desperation as the residents of the Warren scrounge for survival.

The walls are adorned with flickering lanterns, casting eerie shadows on the rough-hewn stone floor. Crates and boxes overflowing with scavenged goods line the stalls, while makeshift workbenches cluttered with tools and machinery dot the landscape. The sound of haggling merchants, clanging metal, and distant rumbling of machinery fills the air.

The Warren is connected to the Tech Bazaar through a network of hidden tunnels and narrow passages. These secret routes allow for clandestine meetings between traders, smugglers, and other shady characters. It's a place where one can find rare components, stolen goods, or even illicit information. However, it's also a hotbed of competition, as rival scavengers and traders vie for control of the territory.

**Gangs and Factions:**

* The Rust Riders: A gang of scavengers who have set up shop in the Warren, seeking to undermine your operations.
* The Ratty Crew: A group of vicious rat-kin who prey on unwary visitors, making the Warren a treacherous place to navigate.
* The Scavenger's Guild: A loose association of scavengers and traders who seek to protect their interests and maintain control over the Warren.

**Resources:**

* 1x Palanite Enforcer (patrolling the Warren)
* 1x Archaeotech Device (hidden in a secret chamber)
* 2x crates of salvaged goods
* 1x workbench with basic tools and machinery

**Challenges:**

* The Warren is infested with gangs of vicious rat-kin, who prey on unwary visitors.
* A rival gang, the Rust Riders, has set up shop in the Warren and is actively seeking to undermine your operations.
* The Scavenger's Guild is wary of outsiders and may view you as a threat to their interests.

Which approach will you take? Will you try to negotiate with the Rust Riders or take them down through force? Or perhaps you'll focus on exploiting the Archaeotech Device for its secrets and power?

Please respond with one of the following options:

1. Roll 2D6 to determine which scenario unfolds.
2. Use Goonhammer's suggested scenario table for a different approach.
3. Choose a specific resource or scenario to start with.

## Special Rules
I've added the Special Rules for the Scavenger's Warren:

**[Scavenger's Warren]]**
**Resources:*
	+ 1x Palanite Enforcer (patrolling the Warren)
	+ 1x Archaeotech Device (hidden in a secret chamber)
**Challenges:*
	+ The Warren is infested with gangs of vicious rat-kin, who prey on unwary visitors.
	+ A rival gang, the "Rust Riders," has set up shop in the Warren and is actively seeking to undermine your operations.
*Special Rules:*
	+ **Scavenger's Maze**: When a gang attempts to take control of the Scavenger's Warren, they must navigate a maze of narrow alleys and cramped market stalls. The gang must roll 1d6 and add their lowest skill value (e.g., Shoota or Choppa). If the result equals or exceeds the target number (set by the GM), the gang successfully navigates the maze and can engage in combat with any rival gangs.
	+ **Rat-Kin Ambush**: When a gang is navigating the Scavenger's Warren, there is a 50% chance that they will be ambushed by rat-kin. The rat-kin will attack the gang with their natural weapons (1d6 + lowest skill value). If the gang is successful in navigating the maze, they can choose to engage the rat-kin or continue exploring the Warren.

Which approach will you take? Will you try to negotiate with the Rust Riders or take them down through force? Or perhaps you'll focus on exploiting the Archaeotech Device for its secrets and power?

Please respond with one of the following options:
1. Roll 2D6 to determine which scenario unfolds.
2. Use Goonhammer's suggested scenario table for a different approach.
3. Choose a specific resource or scenario to start with.

Remember, in Necromunda, skills are better when they're lower!

## Boons
Let's get started.

You decide to roll 2D6 to determine which scenario unfolds. The dice read: **dice: 1d6** = 4, and **dice: 1d6** = 3. Adding these numbers together gives you a total of 7.

According to the scenario table, with a total of 7, the following scenario unfolds:

**Scenario:** "Rat-Kin Ransom"

The Rust Riders gang has taken control of a key market stall in the Scavenger's Warren, and they're demanding a ransom from the current gang in power. The rat-kin gangs are getting restless, sensing an opportunity to strike at the rival gang.

**Boons/Benefits:**

* Controlling the Scavenger's Warren grants your gang +1 to all Negotiation tests.
* You gain access to a hidden cache of rare components and stolen goods, worth 10 points.
* The Palanite Enforcer becomes more cooperative, offering to provide additional security for your gang in exchange for a favor.

What would you like to do next? Do you:
1. Roll 2D6 again to determine the outcome of the ransom demand.
2. Use Goonhammer's suggested scenario table for a different approach.
3. Choose a specific resource or scenario to start with.

Remember, in Necromunda, skills are better when they're lower!

## Income
Controlling the Scavenger's Warren can bring in a decent income, considering its strategic location and the valuable resources available within.

**Income:** The gang controlling the Scavenger's Warren can generate an average of 15-20 credits per cycle. This is based on the territory's value as a hub for scavenging and trading.

To determine the income generated, you'll need to roll:

`dice: (1d6) * 10`

This will give you the total credit earned for that cycle. Keep in mind that this is just an average, and actual earnings may vary depending on the gang's performance and any challenges they face while controlling the territory.

For example, if you roll a 3 on the dice, your income would be:

`3 * 10 = 30 credits`

Remember to keep track of your gang's total credit earned over time. This will help you plan for future operations and make strategic decisions about how to allocate resources.

## Dice Rolls
The Scavenger's Warren awaits! As we begin our journey, let's determine how much income we'll receive from this territory.

`dice: 1d6`

Rolling for Income... *rolls*

You received **3** credits as a result of your endeavors in the Scavenger's Warren. Not bad, considering the risks involved!

Now that you have some income, you can use it to acquire new resources, upgrade your gang, or even recruit new members. The choice is yours.

What would you like to do with this income? Do you want to:
1. Roll 2D6 to determine which scenario unfolds.
2. Use Goonhammer's suggested scenario table for a different approach.
3. Choose a specific resource or scenario to start with.

Please respond with one of the above options, and we'll proceed accordingly!
