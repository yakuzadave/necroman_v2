## Description
**The Promethium Cache**

Deep within the Necromunda underhive, hidden away from prying eyes and scavenging gangs, lies a treasure trove of valuable resources: The Promethium Cache. This ancient storage facility was built by the long-lost hive-mind to stockpile the precious promethium fuel that powers the hive's machinery.

The cache is nestled within a maze of narrow tunnels and rocky outcroppings, making it a challenging location to navigate. The air is thick with the acrid smell of promethium residue, and the ground is slick with oil and grime. Cautious fighters will need to use their wits and cunning to avoid the many hidden dangers lurking in every shadow.

**Terrain**

* **Rocky Outcroppings**: Jagged rock formations jut out from the walls, providing cover for fighters but also creating treacherous terrain that can slow movement or even trap unwary combatants.
* **Narrow Tunnels**: Tight passageways force fighters to move single-file, making them vulnerable to ambushes and making it difficult to maneuver with heavy equipment.
* **Pitfalls**: Cracks in the floor and ceiling of the tunnels threaten to swallow careless fighters whole. A successful Agility test (add +1 to the roll) can help avert disaster, but failure will leave a fighter stuck or injured.
* **Hidden Caches**: Scattered throughout the tunnel system are hidden storage compartments containing small amounts of promethium, as well as other valuable resources.

**Special Rules**

* **Scavenging**: Fighters can use their Perception to search for hidden resources within 3" of any fighter. On a successful Perception test (add +1 to the roll), they find 10-20 Credits worth of promethium. This rule can be used once per turn.
* **Promethium Rich**: The Promethium Cache is filled with valuable resources. When a fighter uses their Action to scavenge for promethium, there's a 50% chance they'll find an additional 20-30 Credits worth of promethium.

**Boon**

The cache is said to hold hidden secrets and surprises, waiting for fighters brave enough to uncover them. When a fighter discovers a new resource or valuable information within the cache, they gain a bonus to their next Perception test equal to the value of the resource (e.g., +1 for 10-20 Credits worth of promethium).

Now that we have our location established, which gang would you like to play as: the Escher Enforcers, the Van Saar Syndicate, or the Goliath Gang?

## Special Rules
I apologize for the mistake earlier! Let me re-establish the Promethium Cache territory with the correct Special Rules.

**Special Rules:**

* **Ambushers' Playground**: When a fighter from another gang enters the Promethium Cache, there's a 30% chance that a hidden ambush will trigger. Roll a dice and add +1 if the entering fighter has the Ambusher special rule. If the result equals or exceeds the fighter's Initiative, an ambush is triggered.
* **Tunnels and Traps**: When combat occurs within the Promethium Cache, all fighters have a 20% chance to become stuck in the tunnels. Roll a dice and add +1 if the fighter has the Strong special rule. If the result equals or exceeds the fighter's Initiative, they become stuck for the rest of the turn.

These Special Rules are designed to create challenging combat scenarios within the Promethium Cache. The ambushers' playground rule adds an element of surprise, while tunnels and traps increase the difficulty of maneuverability within the terrain.

Now that we have our territory set up with the correct Special Rules, let's proceed with the campaign! Which gang would you like to play as: the Escher Enforcers, the Van Saar Syndicate, or the Goliath Gang?

## Income
Controlling the Promethium Cache as a Medium-Hazard territory allows each gang to generate Income based on the territory's value.

As the arbitrator, I determine that controlling the Promethium Cache generates an additional **50 Credits** per turn for each gang.

To determine their income generated from this location, each gang needs to roll a dice and add the result to their starting income. The relevant dice roll is:

`dice: 1d6 + 1`

The `+1` represents the bonus from controlling the Promethium Cache as a Medium-Hazard territory.

Let me know when you're ready to roll for your gang's income generated from this location!
