## Description
**Cinderfall**

[Cinderfall]] is a recently ravaged territory that was once a thriving industrial hub in the underhive. The catastrophic event known as "The Great Fire" ravaged the area, leaving behind a trail of destruction and debris. The once-bustling streets are now a maze of twisted metal and smoldering ruins.

As you venture into Cinderfall, the air is thick with the acrid smell of smoke and ash. The ground beneath your feet is uneven, covered in a layer of charred rubble and broken machinery. The sounds of screeching gulls and distant explosions echo through the desolate landscape, a constant reminder of the devastation that has been wrought.

Despite the chaos, there are still signs of life amidst the ruins. Flickering torches cast an eerie glow over makeshift shelters, while scavenging gangs and opportunistic traders seek to capitalize on the disaster. Amidst the rubble, you might stumble upon abandoned machinery, half-buried in the debris or covered in rust and dust.

**Unique Features:**

1. **Debris Fields**: Cinderfall is littered with rubble and wreckage from the Great Fire. This creates challenging terrain for gangs to navigate, with a 50% chance of slowing movement or causing injuries.
2. **Smoldering Ruins**: The fires still smolder beneath the surface, threatening to erupt into full-blown blazes at any moment. Roll a `dice: 1d6` and add +1 if the gang has a skilled Firefighter. On a roll of 1-3, a fire breaks out, forcing all gangs in the territory to make a Disorient test. On a roll of 4-6, the fire is extinguished, but the gang gains 2 Credits.
3. **Industrial Remnants**: Abandoned machinery and equipment dot the landscape, providing valuable scrap metal for gangs to scavenge.

**Special Rules:**

1. **Scavenging**: Gangs can salvage valuable parts and tools from the industrial remnants. Roll a `dice: 1d6` and add +2 if the gang has a skilled Scavenger. On a roll of 4-6, they gain 5 Credits and 1 Scrap Metal. If the roll is 1-3, the salvage operation fails, and the gang loses 2 Credits.
2. **Fire Hazards**: When a fire breaks out, all gangs in Cinderfall must make a Disorient test. On a failure, they suffer -1 to their next combat roll.

**Territory Size:** Medium (3-4 inches)

## Special Rules
I apologize for the mistake earlier! Let's redefine the Special Rules for Cinderfall to make it more impactful on combat scenarios.

**Special Rules:** (Combat-Related)
1. **Fire Hazards**: When a gang attempts to take control of Cinderfall, roll a `dice: 1d6`. On a roll of 1-2, a fire breaks out in the territory, forcing all gangs involved in the battle to make a Disorient test. On failure, they suffer -1 to their next combat roll.
2. **Debris Fields**: The debris-filled terrain in Cinderfall makes it difficult for gangs to maneuver. When a gang attempts to take control of the location, subtract 1 from their Initiative score.
3. **Industrial Ruins**: The abandoned machinery and equipment in Cinderfall can be used as makeshift cover or obstacles. When a gang attempts to take control of the location, roll a `dice: 1d6`. On a roll of 4-6, they can use the industrial ruins to gain +1 to their Defense score.

These Special Rules will make combat scenarios more challenging and unpredictable in Cinderfall, reflecting the harsh environment and chaotic atmosphere of the territory.

## Income
According to the Necromunda rules, controlling a territory like Cinderfall generates income based on its size and the gang's reputation.

**Territory Size:** Medium (3-4 inches)

**Reputation:** Let's assume our gang has a reputation of **2** (out of 5) in this territory. This means they have established some presence and influence, but it's not yet a stronghold.

To determine the income generated by controlling Cinderfall, we need to roll a `dice: 1d6` and add the result to the gang's reputation.

*`Income Roll:` `dice: 1d6`
*
The result is... *drumroll*

Let's say the roll is **3**. We add this to the gang's reputation of **2**, making the total income generated by controlling Cinderfall:

**5 Credits**

This income will be added to the gang's existing credits, allowing them to purchase new equipment, upgrade their fighters, and explore other opportunities.

Keep in mind that this income is generated solely from controlling the territory and does not include any additional income from events or activities within the territory.
