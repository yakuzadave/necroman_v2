## Description
**Rogue Doc Shop**


Location Type: Settlement


Description:
The Rogue Doc Shop is a makeshift clinic and scavenging hub, attracting desperate individuals seeking medical attention or looking to trade in valuable goods. The air is thick with disinfectant and desperation as the sounds of sizzling flesh and groaning patients fill the air. The walls are lined with rusty medical equipment, old textbooks, and shelves stacked with crates of dubious medicinal supplies.

In the center of the shop, a makeshift operating table stands, surrounded by scattered tools and half-finished surgeries. A haphazard assortment of beds and cots line the perimeter, where patients lie in various states of recovery or decline. The smell of antiseptic and decay hangs heavy over everything, mingling with the acrid scent of burning flesh.

Despite its unsavory appearance, the Rogue Doc Shop is a vital hub for those seeking medical attention in the harsh underhive environment. Desperate individuals will stop at nothing to get treated, even if it means risking their lives or sanity.

## Income
As the leader of the Rogue Doc Shop, your gang earns a base income of 2 credits per turn.

However, you can increase your income by rolling a dice:

`dice: 1d6 + 1`

If the result equals or exceeds 4, you earn an additional credit. If the result is 3 or lower, your income remains at 2 credits.

So, the maximum income for this location would be 3 credits per turn (2 base credits + 1 additional credit).

Keep in mind that this income is subject to change based on the challenges and special rules associated with this location.
