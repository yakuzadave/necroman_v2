## Description
**Blackout's Bounty**

Deep within the labyrinthine underhive, hidden behind a network of tunnels and abandoned ventilation shafts, lies the coveted **Blackout's Bounty**: a treacherous yet lucrative promethium cache. This forgotten repository of precious resources is guarded by crude traps, toxic gas leaks, and hidden hazards, making it a true test of survival for any gang willing to take on the challenge.

**Layout:**
The Blackout's Bounty is situated at the intersection of several narrow tunnels, with the promethium cache itself located in a large, dimly lit chamber. The area is littered with abandoned equipment and machinery, including rusting pipes, broken conveyor belts, and discarded tools. Cramped spaces and narrow passages make ambushes and surprise attacks possible, while hidden dangers lurk around every corner.

**Features:**

* **Promethium Cache:** A large stash of promethium, stored in sealed containers and protected by crude traps.
* **Abandoned Equipment:** Scattered throughout the area are abandoned machines and tools, potentially useful for scavenging or upgrading gang gear.
* **Tunnels and Passages:** Narrow tunnels and cramped spaces, making ambushes and surprise attacks possible. Gangs can also use these passages to move undetected.
* **Hidden Hazards:** Toxic gas leaks, falling debris, and hidden pitfalls wait to trap unwary gang members.

**Challenges:**

* **Rival Gangs:** Competing gangs will stop at nothing to claim the promethium cache for themselves. Expect fierce battles and cunning tactics as rival gangs vie for control.
* **Toxic Environment:** The area is heavily polluted, with toxic chemicals and hazardous waste posing a risk to gang members. Exposure to these dangers can result in wounds, Shaken status, or even death.
* **Treacherous Terrain:** The tunnels are treacherous, with narrow passages, collapsing walls, and hidden pitfalls waiting to trap unwary gang members.

**Benefits:**

* **Promethium Fuel:** The cache can be used to fuel gang activities, such as manufacturing equipment or upgrading existing gear.
* **Scavenging Opportunities:** Abandoned equipment and machinery can be scavenged for useful components or upgraded using salvaged parts.
* **Gang Stronghold:** Gangs can establish a strong presence in the area, using it as a base of operations or a hub for trade and commerce.

**Special Rules:**

* **Toxic Trap**: When attempting to scavenge equipment or promethium, roll a 1d6. On a 1-2, the gang member triggers a toxic gas leak, causing them to lose 1 wound and becoming Shaken.
* **Scavenging Bonanza**: If your gang rolls a 5 or 6 on an Income dice roll, they stumble upon a hidden cache of valuable components or equipment. This can be used to upgrade gear or earn additional credits.
* **Rival Gangs**: The presence of rival gangs in Blackout's Bounty means that any gang operating in the area must spend 1 credit per turn to maintain their position and avoid being driven out by competition.

## Special Rules
Let's add some special rules to Blackout's Bounty:

**Blackout's Bounty**

**Special Rules:**

* **Toxic Tunnels**: When a gang attempts to take control of Blackout's Bounty from another gang, roll a 1d6. On a 1-2, the terrain becomes treacherous, causing all gang members in the affected area to become Shaken.
* **Crude Traps**: Any gang attempting to breach the promethium cache must pass a Stealth test (using the Gangs' Stealth skill). Failure results in the traps triggering, causing the gang to lose 1-2 models and becoming Shaken.
* **Hidden Hazards**: When a gang is fighting for control of Blackout's Bounty, roll a 1d6. On a 3 or higher, a hidden hazard (such as falling debris or toxic gas) affects both gangs, causing them to lose 1 model each.

These special rules will make combat scenarios in Blackout's Bounty more challenging and unpredictable, reflecting the harsh environment of the underhive.

## Income
According to the Necromunda rules, a gang controlling a location can earn income based on the location's rating. Blackout's Bounty has a rating of 4 (as determined by the dice roll earlier). To calculate the income, you'll need to consult the Income Table in the Necromunda rulebook.

For a location with a rating of 4, the gang would earn:

* 8-12 credits per turn if they have a strong presence (i.e., they're not being attacked or harassed by rival gangs)
* 4-6 credits per turn if they have a moderate presence
* 0-2 credits per turn if they have a weak presence

To determine the gang's income, you'll need to roll a dice and consult the table. I'll help with that!

`dice: 1d6`
Please roll the dice, and we'll use the result to determine your gang's income from controlling Blackout's Bounty.
