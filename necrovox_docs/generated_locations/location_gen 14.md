Let me expand on the Scrapyard Slums territory:

**Territory: "Scrapyard Slums"**
Link back to: [Tech Bazaar]
The Scrapyard Slums is a labyrinthine district built from the detritus of the underhive's industrial past. The area is a maze of narrow alleys, crumbling shacks, and makeshift homes constructed from salvaged scrap metal, old machinery, and discarded junk. The air reeks of smoke, oil, and decay as the sounds of scavenging and haggling fill the air.

The Scrapyard Slums are home to a diverse array of inhabitants, including scrappers, tinkerers, and petty gangers. These individuals eke out a living by salvaging valuable components from the scrap metal and machinery that fills the district. The area is also a hotbed of black market activity, with shady dealers and smugglers operating in the shadows.

**Territory Bonus:**
+1 to all Recruit rolls made by gangs operating within this territory. Additionally, any gang controlling the Scrapyard Slums gains a 5% chance to recover a piece of salvaged equipment (e.g., a power sword or shotgun) after each battle fought from this territory.

**Territory Control:**
To take control of the Scrapyard Slums, a gang must either win a battle with the territory at stake or exchange captives for it. If a gang loses control of the Scrapyard Slums, they forfeit their bonus and any salvaged equipment recovered from this territory.

The Scrapyard Slums are a key location in the underhive, providing access to valuable resources and information. However, the area is also notorious for its lawlessness and violence, making it a challenging environment for even the most hardened gangs.

Now that we have our new territory, let's get back to the story at hand. You've earned 5 credits from the Tech Bazaar's various vendors and traders. What would you like to do with your newfound credits?

## Description
Let me expand on the Scrapyard Slums:

**Territory: "Scrapyard Slums"**
Link back to: [Tech Bazaar]
The Scrapyard Slums is a labyrinthine district of makeshift homes, scavenged from the very scrap metal and discarded junk that fills the air. The stench of smoke, oil, and decay hangs heavy over the area, as if the very atmosphere itself was infused with the desperation and poverty that defines this place.

Rusted hulks of abandoned machinery loom like sentinels, their twisted limbs reaching out like skeletal fingers to snag at the scraps of fabric, wire, and metal that serve as makeshift roofing for the shacks. The sounds of scavenging and haggling fill the air, as gangs and traders alike scour the area for valuable scraps to sell or salvage.

The streets are narrow and winding, forcing visitors to navigate through a maze of makeshift stalls and marketplaces. Vendors hawk their wares – everything from salvaged parts to stolen goods – while shady characters lurk in the shadows, waiting to pounce on unsuspecting prey.

Despite its squalid appearance, the Scrapyard Slums holds a certain allure for those willing to take risks. Rumors of hidden caches of valuable scrap metal and machinery circulate through the district, drawing in gangs and scavengers from far and wide. For those who can navigate the treacherous politics and rivalries that govern this place, the Scrapyard Slums offers a chance to strike it rich – or at least, to survive another day.

What do you think? Shall we add more territories to the Dominion Campaign?

Now that we have our expanded description, let's get back to the story at hand. You've earned 5 credits from the Tech Bazaar's various vendors and traders. What would you like to do with your newfound credits?

## Special Rules
Let's add some special rules to the Scrapyard Slums territory.

**Special Rules:**

* **Scavenger's Delight:** When a gang attempts to take control of the Scrapyard Slums, they must make a `dice: 1d6` roll. On a roll of 4 or higher, the gang gains a +1 bonus to their Wargear rolls for the duration of the battle.
* **Junkyard Jumble:** If the defending gang (the one controlling the Scrapyard Slums) is defeated in combat, they have a 10% chance to recover a piece of salvaged equipment (e.g., a power sword or shotgun) from the scrap piles. This equipment can be used immediately.

These special rules add an extra layer of excitement and unpredictability to battles fought for control of the Scrapyard Slums. The scavenger's delight bonus gives the attacking gang a chance to gain an advantage, while the junkyard jumble rule allows the defending gang to potentially recover valuable equipment even in defeat.

Now that we have our new territory with special rules, what would you like to do with your 5 credits earned from the Tech Bazaar?

What do you think? Shall we add more territories to the Dominion Campaign?

Now that we have our new territory, let's get back to the story at hand. You've earned 5 credits from the Tech Bazaar's various vendors and traders. What would you like to do with your newfound credits?

## Income
Let's link the Scrapyard Slums' income to its control.

**Territory Income:** When a gang controls the Scrapyard Slums, they can earn credits through scavenging and trading. To determine their income, they must roll:

`dice: (1d6) * 10`

This means that the gang will roll a single six-sided die, multiply the result by 10, and add it to their total income.

For example, if the roll is a 4, the gang would earn an additional 40 credits.

## Dice Rolls
Let's get back to the story.

You've earned 5 credits from the Tech Bazaar's various vendors and traders. You can use these credits to acquire new gear, upgrade your existing equipment, or simply stash them away for later.

What would you like to do with your newfound credits?

`dice: 1d6`
Rolling for income... *rolls*
Result: **3**
You earn an additional 3 credits from the Tech Bazaar's various vendors and traders. You now have a total of 8 credits.

Here are your options:

A) Spend some credits on new gear or upgrades.
B) Stash away your credits for later use.
C) Try to negotiate with the shady-looking characters you noticed earlier.
D) Explore other opportunities in the Tech Bazaar.

Which option do you choose?
