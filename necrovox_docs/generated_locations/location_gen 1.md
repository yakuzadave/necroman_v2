# Location Details
[ Technologies Bazaar ]

## Description
As you navigate through the winding alleys of the Tech Bazaar, the sounds of machinery whirring and sparks flying fill the air. Amidst the chaos, a small, unassuming stall catches your eye - Gorvoth's Gizmos. The sign above it reads in faded letters: "Gorvoth's Gizmos - Fixing the Unfixable Since the Hive Fell". The vendor, Gorvoth himself, is a hunched-over, bespectacled individual with a talent for fixing just about anything.

## Special Rules
* **Tinkerer's Advantage:** Roll a dice (1d6) and add the result to your gang's current Income total. This bonus can be used to acquire more items or upgrade existing equipment.
* **Tech Takedown:** If a rival gang attempts to take control of Gorvoth's Gizmos, they must first overcome a Tech-based challenge. Roll a dice (2d6) * 10 and add the result to your gang's current Income total. This bonus can be used to acquire more items or upgrade existing equipment.
* **Gizmo Gauntlet:** When a rival gang is attempting to take control of Gorvoth's Gizmos, they must navigate through a series of obstacles (represented by a gauntlet of challenges). Each challenge requires a specific skillset (e.g., Tech, Leadership) and can be overcome with a successful dice roll.

## Income
To determine the income generated by controlling Gorvoth's Gizmos, you would roll:

`dice: 1d6`
Add the result of this roll to your gang's current Income total. For example, if you roll a 4, and your current Income total is 100 credits, your new Income total would be 104 credits.
