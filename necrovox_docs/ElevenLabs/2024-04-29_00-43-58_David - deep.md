> Necromunda is a sprawling, evolving game, with numerous rules published since its 2017 version. These rules vary across publications, with some contradictions. The community has created compilations to keep the game playable. The goal of this website is to make the rules clear and accessible, consolidating all content from the 2017 release onwards. Initially based on the Necrodamus rules compilation, the 2023 Core Rules are now used verbatim (RAW), covering both these and previous publications.
