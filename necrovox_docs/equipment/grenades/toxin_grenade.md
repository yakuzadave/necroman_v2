description: Neurotoxin grenades release a potent neurotoxin that can disrupt an enemy's nervous system, causing them to become disoriented and lose their ability to fight effectively.
effects: Causes enemies within the blast radius to become stunned, slowing their movements and impairing their reaction time. The effects are cumulative, with repeated exposure increasing the duration of the stun.
limits: Neurotoxin grenades have a limited range due to the dispersion of the toxin in air. They are most effective when used in enclosed spaces or against enemies that are already disoriented. Heavy armor or protective suits can provide some resistance to the neurotoxin's effects, but not completely eliminate them.
