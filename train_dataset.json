Initially based on the Necrodamus rules compilation, the 2023 Core Rules are now used verbatim (RAW), covering both these and previous publications.\n\n**Note:** All original content is owned by Games Workshop and published here without permission.

Cross-reference the weapon\u2019s Strength with the hit fighter\u2019s Toughness and roll a D6 on the table below to determine if the fighter is wounded by the attack:\n\n        | Strength vs Toughness | D6 Roll Required |\n        |-----------------------|------------------|\n        | Is the Strength TWICE the Toughness or greater? | 2+ |\n        | Is the Strength GREATER than the Toughness? | 3+ |\n        | Is the Strength EQUAL to the Toughness? | 4+ |\n        | Is the Strength LOWER than the Toughness? | 5+ |\n        | Is the Strength HALF the Toughness or lower? | 6+ |\n\n2. **MAKE A SAVE ROLL**\n    - If a hit results in a successful Wound roll, or leads to an Injury roll being made against the fighter for any reason, the fighter may be able to make a Save roll.\n    - Only one Save roll may be made for each hit that successfully wounds, or leads to an Injury roll being made, regardless of how many different Save rolls a fighter may have. For example, if a fighter wears both mesh armour and a refractor field, they may only attempt a Save roll against a successful Wound roll with one of those items.\n    - Save rolls are made either:\n        - After the Wound roll is made but before the Wound is removed from the fighter, in which case the Wound is \u2018saved\u2019 and not removed.\n        - If the attack has a Damage \u2018-\u2019 characteristic and causes an Injury dice to be rolled against the fighter for any reason, a Save roll is made before any Injury dice are rolled.\n    - Players should note that some weapon traits will disallow Save rolls. For example, the Gas Weapon trait states that no Save roll can be made. In such cases, regardless of any modifiers, no Save roll can be made.\n    - Armour Penetration: It may happen that the Armour Penetration (AP) characteristic of a weapon is greater than the Save roll granted by the armour a fighter wears, thus canceling out the Save roll. For example, a fighter wearing mesh armour has a Save roll of 5+, but if they are hit by a weapon with AP -3, no Save roll would be possible.\n    - Positive Save Modifiers: In some situations, such as a fighter benefiting from partial or full cover against an attack that uses a Blast marker, a fighter\u2019s Save roll may be improved. In such situations, this positive modifier may be added to a fighter\u2019s normal Save roll but may not be added to Field armour. For example, if a fighter wearing mesh armour (5+ save) and a displacer field (4+ save) gains a +1 modifier to their Save roll, they may improve their mesh armour save to 4+ but may not improve their displacer field save to 3+.\n    - If a fighter not wearing armour benefits from a positive save modifier, treat their save as 7+ for the purposes of modification. For example, if a fighter wearing no armour gains a +2 save modifier, they will be able to make a Save roll of 5+.\n    - Rolls of a Natural 1: A roll of a natural 1 when making a Save roll is always an automatic failure, regardless of any modifiers that may apply.",

Nothing yet created by the Noble Houses compares to the damage faith has done to their people, and nothing in the entire hive world unites its inhabitants so surely. Even the fear of Lord Helmawr and the Imperial House cannot compete with true faith, and it is in this that House Cawdor\u2019s power lies. All the other Clan Houses and Noble Houses are built upon alliances, the exchange of wealth, and obligation; their roots tied inexplicably to the industry of the hive world. Though House Cawdor shares in this industry, it is not defined by it. Rather, where most count credits each cycle to measure the worth of their subjects, the people of Clan Cawdor consider themselves strong so long as their faith remains strong. This has saved Cawdor from extinction where so many other Clan Houses have succumbed to the march of time or the ebb and flow of production quotas. For even while Cawdor languishes beneath its peers in terms of wealth and military might, it has never been poor in its beliefs.*\n\n*From the outside, other Necromundans see House Cawdor as bonepickers, scavengers and beggars, little better than the hive rats that plague their holesteads. Only the mantle of being born of a Clan House elevates them above the clanless masses or the serf class, though most self-respecting subjects of Lord Helmawr will not deal with them. However, they do perform a vital role within hive society, picking through the refuse and cast-offs of the factoria, so that nothing might go to waste. If this were the only thing they were known for, Clan Cawdor might be better accepted by their peers. As it is, few can think of the Clan House without thinking of the faith that drives them. And they are not mistaken in this belief, for on Necromunda, Clan Cawdor and the Redemptionist faith are one and the same.*",

This is a fact as true among the greater diaspora of humanity as it is on Necromunda, and in the depths of the hive cities there are none more faithful than the followers of the Redemption. Tales abound of members of Clan Cawdor overcoming terrible wounds, delivering devastating blows or even cheating death itself through the strength of their belief. While undoubtedly many of these tales are either exaggerated or outright fabrications, enough evidence exists to make those who have faced the warriors of the Redemption wonder just what it might have been that turned aside their bullet or lent strength to the attacks of their foes \u2013 was it just luck, or was something divine at work?*\n\nArticles of Faith are a collection of rules that apply to all House Cawdor fighters. As they focus on the faith and conviction of the followers of the Redemption they are not so clean cut as things like Skills, Wargear or bionics that grant their users clearly defined benefits at an XP or credit cost. Rather, should a Cawdor fighter believe strongly enough in themselves, their brothers and the God-Emperor, something miraculous might happen. Equally though, should the fighter\u2019s faith falter, then the gifts of the God-Emperor that were so graciously bestowed upon them might just as easily be taken away.",

Sometimes a tide of righteous frenzy will envelop the fighters of House Cawdor, bearing them to victory on a tide of religious zeal. Other times the gaze of the God-Emperor will turn away from them, leaving them to their fate.\n\nIn the End phase of each round (including the first), count up the number of friendly House Cawdor fighters currently on the battlefield that are neither Seriously Injured or Broken, and roll a D6 for each. Each dice that rolls a 5 or 6 is added to a special pool of dice called the Faith dice pool (this can also be represented by tokens or notes on a piece of paper if it is easier).\n\nCawdor fighters may also attempt to work themselves up into a frenzy of faith \u2013 waving holy relics, chanting prayers or flagellating themselves \u2013 during their activation by performing the Beseech the God-Emperor (Double) action:\n\n**Beseech the God-Emperor (Double):**\u00a0During the End phase, roll three D6 for a fighter that performed this action, rather than the usual one.\n\nFaith dice can be retained from one round to the next.

An Article of Faith must be invoked and performed at the start of a fighter\u2019s activation, before performing any actions. Attempting an Article of Faith does not require the fighter to use one of their actions (unless otherwise noted).\n\nWhen invoking an Article of Faith, the controlling player declares the Article of Faith the fighter is attempting to invoke. The fighter then makes a Threshold test. To make a Threshold test, the player chooses a number of Faith dice to roll, removing them from the Faith dice pool and rolling them. Once this roll has been made, the number of dice used cannot be changed, i.e., the player cannot roll more Faith dice to increase the total rolled. Once a dice has been taken from the Faith dice pool, it is used up and discarded:\n\n- If the total result equals or exceeds the threshold of the Article of Faith being invoked, a miracle has occurred and the Article of Faith is performed successfully!\n- If the total result is lower than the threshold of the Article of Faith being invoked, they have failed and the God-Emperor has turned his back on them.",

Most Redemptionist faiths stay more or less true to the core tenets of the Clan House, those rules that reflect tried and true beliefs. Some stray, or include divergent philosophies.\n\nThese divergent beliefs are represented in games of Necromunda by the four \u2018Paths of Faith\u2019. These are the Path of the Faithful, the Path of the Fanatic, the Path of the Doomed, and the Path of the Redeemer.\n\nThe Path of Faith a House Cawdor gang follows is determined by their Leader and must be chosen when the gang is first created. Once a Path has been chosen the Leader may not choose another or change it. However, should the Leader die, their successor may choose their own Path \u2013 affecting the rest of the gang as normal.\n\nEach Path grants the gang access to a different set of Articles of Faith, reflecting the ideologies of the gang members.

Most other clans see little distinction between the Delaque Spektor forms and consider them merely another mechanical ally created by the House of Shadow. In truth, the Piscean Spektors are unlike anything else employed by the Delaque and are more akin to a true race in their own right. A cybernetic form wrapped around a harvested xenos brain, the Spektor retains much of its memories from its prior existence, and serves the Clan House in accordance with an ancient pact between humans and its race. While not even the Delaque know for sure where the Pisceans come from, it is believed they are an aquatic race that arrived on Necromunda millennia ago and made their home in its subterranean seas. Occasionally, ancient members of this race come to the Delaque to have their brains placed in machines, the two races sharing a common connection to the Psychoterica.*\n\n*In life, a Piscean warrior is a ferocious aquatic alien, shark-headed and inhumanly strong. When its brain is interned in the shell of a Spektor, its connection to the Psychoterica becomes even stronger and it develops psychic powers. While still a competent warrior, favouring savage close quarters combat, its true strength is its ability to channel the Psychoterica into strange and deadly powers. This same ability allows it to float through the air, rapidly climb structures and move with a disturbing grace that belies its cumbersome form. When the Delaque are expecting trouble or staging an important assault, it is often to their Piscean Spektors they will turn, the creations perfectly adapted for combat in the underhive with a truly alien lust for battle.*\n\n**100CREDITS**",

Among these, the Cephalopod Spektor is perhaps the most sinister, and the most effective. Each Spektor is a writhing mass of mechanical tentacles and gleaming oculi, its whirring lenses constantly tracking the shadows for movement. Via a complex array of auspexes, the Spektor drinks in its surroundings and communicates them to its owner, granting them a multi-spectral view of the battlefield. The Spektor\u2019s cogitator is built around a fragment of synaptic tissue, grown from its owner\u2019s genetic material. Extracted from a cloned brain gestated to the edge of adulthood, the fragment is interred into the mechanical cranium of the Spektor, and then raised to consciousness by its master. This cognitive bonding also has its drawbacks, however \u2013 a Spektor might anticipate its master\u2019s needs, but it also often shares their hatreds or fears, making it act erratically if their owner gives in to rage or panic.*\n\n**70CREDITS**",

In life, however, their abilities are all too terrifying to behold. Wyrms can burrow through all manner of obstacles, from ferrocrete to plasteel, or squeeze their way through the tiniest of openings, as their bodies constrict and segment with unnatural speed. This mobility makes them excellent spies for the Delaque, as there are few places they cannot travel.

These are the pillars of what it means to be Escher, a drive to prove their strength through skill at arms and reckless aggression, fuelled by a chemical empire that mixes Imperial science with pagan ritual. To outsiders, Eschers are cruel and deadly warriors, a perfection of the female fighter on Necromunda. Their gangs stalk the underhive alongside strange and exotic beasts, the mere touch of their weapons enough to corrupt blood or set a victim\u2019s nerves on fire. Above these youthful and energetic gang warriors toils a House more prosperous than any on Necromunda \u2013 all women born beneath the beneficent smile of a Clan Chymist equal in the eyes of the Matriarch Primus and her Council of Crones. Thus may an Escher prove herself no matter the manner or place of her birthand, should she do well in the concoction of chems, therearing of xenos beasts, or fighting for the clan in the endless inter-House wars, she may well rise up to join the council herself \u2013 or perhaps even don the mantle of Matriarch Primus.*",

One of the most successful is the Phelynx, or Venom Cat. A mix of reptilian biology and Phyrr Cat genes, it is an excellent hunting beast. Phelynx are used almost exclusively by the Wyld, the Runners driving entire packs of the creatures before them into battle. As their name implies, a Venom Cat\u2019s bite can be deadly, its neuro-toxic venom able to incapacitate or kill in moments. Wyld Runners routinely apply Phelynx venom to their weapons, while some even imbibe it in small doses to build up a resistance to the toxins. Venom Cats are also naturally stealthy beasts and, like the Wyld Runners themselves, are masters of ambush. Part of this stealth comes from the creature\u2019s instinctive grace and speed, the rest from its unique biology. Unlike Phyrr Cats, Phelynx are coldblooded, their bio-signs barely registering at all, making them extremely difficultto spot with auspexes.*\n\n*The bond between Phelynx and Wyld Runner is one built over a lifetime. When an Escher juve joins the Wyld, she will be given a weapon to master or a pet to train \u2013 this often coming in the form of an infant Phelynx. Over years of hunting and battle the Escher and beast become inseparable, one able to anticipate and coordinate with the actions of the other in a way no two human gangers could ever hope to match.*\n\n**50CREDITS**",

Without the physical strength to dominate rivals or to endure the hardships of Necromunda, a Goliath is nothing. They were created as a slave race to work the refineries and forges of Necromunda and toil in places where even hardy Necromundans could not survive, and while the members of the clan are practically abhuman in their size and strength, only fools underestimate their resourcefulness and low cunning. It was the folly of their creators, who believed the Goliaths could be kept docile and ignorant though genetic meddling, that allowed elements of the clan to gain their independence. Ironically, no sooner had the Goliaths gained their freedom from their creators than they enslaved themselves again through the creation of a savage hierarchy. From among their ranks, the strongest rose to dominate domes and hives, culminating in the ascendance of the Over-tyrant, the lord of all the Goliaths on Necromunda. This overlord holds dominion over the clan via the flow of life-giving stimms \u2013 chem cocktails essential to the continued existence of all Goliaths. The clan\u2019s reverence of strength, however, grants the Over-tyrant this right, and while the members of House Goliath once rebelled against outside control, they willingly accept rulership by one of their own.*\n\n*Goliaths are unique among the peoples of Necromunda, being on the whole gene-smithed beings, forged from a stable genus of humanity but enhanced for strength and endurance. Whether or not Goliaths are, in fact, abhumans remains a subject of much debate among the representatives of the Adeptus Terra on Necromunda, though the Imperium has deemed them \u2018sanctioned\u2019 for use on the hive world under the proviso that Lord Helmawr monitors their development. To date, most Goliaths are still largely created through esoteric biological means \u2013 rapidly grown in amneo-vats from flesh-templates and turned out into the refineries and factories for immediate hard labour. These brutish creations are mostly male and mostly sterile, living for less than a decade on a diet of backbreaking work and growth stimms before their bodies fail and they die. Despite this short life-span, Goliaths are born with a baseline knowledge of their world and their position in it, delivered via a cranial data-slug. During the years of slavery, this mnemonic injection was intended to keep the Goliaths ignorant and included only the basest information, keeping them at a learning level akin to a small child or a clever animal. After the Goliaths won their freedom, the Alphas ensured that the data-slug was altered to include the collected knowledge and experience of the Goliaths who had come before. In this way, the Goliaths share the knowledge of the clan gathered over hundreds of generations, giving them a working understanding of everything from hive industries to clan weaponry.*",

Many Goliath infants are vat-grown, the better to ensure a healthy specimen, whilst others are born of Goliath parents deemed suitable to reproduce for their adherence to the Goliath physical ideal. Whatever the infant\u2019s origin, from an early age House Goliath utilises all manner of artificial assistance to boost its members\u2019 abilities to superhuman levels, be it through the use of combat stimms or other, more esoteric drugs brokered through dealings with House Escher, or the genetic manipulation of their young, up to and including the surgical grafting on of huge volumes of extra muscle mass. There are almost no limits to which the members of House Goliath will not go in their pursuit of what they deem to be the physical ideal. Indeed, this manipulation of their form has gone on for so many centuries that there are those within the Administratum and the Adeptus Mechanicus who believe that many of House Goliath have evolved to become a distinct sub-set of abhuman unique to Necromunda. This is quite alarming considering that gen-hancement and vat-grown muscle grafting is common across the Imperium, and speaks volumes about the levels to which House Goliath has taken these practices.*\n\n*Such abuse of growth stimms, surgeries and other methods is not without risks, however, as even the most baseline of Goliaths will show noticeable reductions in cognitive function. For Goliaths that push the limits of their physical form to the extreme, the risks are even greater. Rampant and uncontrollable muscle growth, spontaneous bone spur mutations, metabolisms that rage out of control and total loss of all higher brain functions are common. Such post-human flesh hulks are frequently seen in the gangs of the underhive, where in the crude parlance of the gangs they are called \u2018Zerkers\u2019, bringing rampant destruction to the foes of their house.*\n\n**120CREDITS**",

Engineered to be hardy and resilient, as well as strong and stoic, they excel in their task, though the legacy of their creation continues to shape them. Even when the Clan House broke away from its creators and earned its freedom, it took with it this heritage of genetic manipulation. The Goliaths\u2019 gene-smithed past means there remains substantial genetic variance within each clan enclave and gang, each drawing their lineage from a different bio-lab, or Alpha. Some represent the best of their kind, toughest of the tough, and are blessed with the most valuable genetic gifts. While others carry biological missteps, their strength and toughness won at a price to their minds or their longevity. Then there are those that are barely true Goliaths at all, their bodies carrying the weakest of the clan\u2019s genetics, even though their loyalty to the Over-tyrant remains undiminished.*",

They provide a huge amount of variety within a Goliath gang, and can be used to create small elite gangs of genetically superior Natborn, flesh-cursed gangs of Vatborn suffering from the biological tampering of their creators, or even gangs of aspiring Unborn who share few of the benefits of the Goliaths but who hope to prove themselves to the clan. Players can also run baseline Goliath gangs without spending any extra credits on Gene-smithing, simply by running gangs of Vatborn without any upgrades.\n\nTo use these rules, fighters must choose a sub-type (Natborn, Vatborn or Unborn) when they are added to the gang \u2013 Vatborn being the default sub-type. The cost of their sub-type is added to the fighter\u2019s credits cost, as detailed in the House Goliath gang list. Other upgrades are optional, and can be added to fighters using the following guidelines:\n\n- Fighters can only be Gene-smithed when they are added to the gang. Under unusual circumstances the Arbitrator might allow a fighter to be Genesmithed during campaign downtime.\n- The fighter can only select Gene-smithing upgrades from those available to their sub-type (as detailed on the Vatborn, Natborn and Unborn tables as follows):\n    - Fighters with the Gang fighter (Juve), (Prospect) or (Ganger) special rule can have a maximum of one Gene-smithed upgrade.\n    - Fighters with the Gang Hierarchy (Leader) or (Champion) special rule may have a maximum of two Gene-smithed upgrades.\n\nCustomise the gang by determining the genetic legacy of the fighters. New fighters added to the gang can be given one of the following origins (affecting cost and gang rating).",

But then you\u2019d have to be made of the black ore of Necromunda to climb the spider\u2019s web of Lord Helmawr\u2019s feudal society as quickly as they have. In just three short millennia, House Orlock has risen from a loose alliance of Clan Families and waste prospectors to become the largest mining operation on the planet. It is a success built upon the backs of a massive slave underclass, the Drudges, born to scrape ore from the dark pits of the Spoil, or work endless cycles in the clan\u2019s smoke- wreathed refineries. House Orlock has had a troubled history with this underclass, and at times they have threatened to rise up and tear down everything the Clan Families have fought to build. It speaks to the ruthlessness and determination of these families that they managed to endure these rebellions, ultimately building their entire social structure around the simmering discontentment within their ranks.*\n\n*From the outside, however, the troubled history of the Drudges is largely unknown, or at the very least discounted, and it is not these unwashed masses that most consider when they think of the Orlocks. The image of the House of Iron is one of veteran rebels, outland ash-riders and bare-knuckled hardmen. This is entirely intentional, and the heads of the Orlock mining families have worked long and hard to cultivate a soldier class within the clan to fight for its interests, and keep the drudging classes in line. At the top of the Orlock social ladder, a small group of families hold power over millions of subjects, who, should they ever unite, could sweep this ruling class away in a single violent uprising. It is only the clan\u2019s gangs that stand in the way of these would-be rebels. As paradoxical as it might seem, most of these gangs come from the drudging classes themselves, selected for their rebellious nature and fierce independence. Thus do the ruling families weed out troublemakers before they have a chance to incite rebellion, and turn them back upon their own kind, with a promise of freedom and power.*",

Most often, the human component of aservitor is harvested from a convicted criminal, one whose crimes are deemed toogreat to allow them to carry on as a part of Imperial society but who may continueto serve in another form rather than be wasted in incarceration or execution. Servitors possess the most rudimentary of human intelligence, their minds scrubbed of past memories and all but the most essential knowledge, artificial memory engrams grafted in their place so that they will know their designated roleand function and little else. Servitors are put to work in all manner of industry andfor any menial task with which an unmodified human cannot perform. They work inhostile environments, their living flesh variously blasted by extremes of heat and cold, eroded by extreme elements, or withered and wasted by toxic surroundings, performing their tasks until they fail, at which point their mechanics are reclaimedand a new human \u2018donor\u2019 grafted into place. House Orlock has ready access to mining and heavy industry servitors of all makes and manner, but those repurposedfor gang warfare often take the form referred to by the gangers as \u2018Luggers\u2019 \u2013 heavy, tracked units able to lift, move and carry bulky cargos.

Whether a legend is true or not, all that matters is that it takes on a life of its own. Soon people start referring to the Orlock by their nickname, which in turn is a self-fulfilling prophecy, as they strive to live up to it no matter what.\n\nOrlock Legendary Names are special names that can be given to an Orlock Leader or Champion, granting them additional benefits. For example, Orlock Gang Leader Rothgo Jax, could be given the Legendary Name \u2018Iron Hard\u2019, thus becoming Rothgo \u2018Iron Hard\u2019 Jax, and gaining the benefits of the Iron Hard name. Legendary names are not without their cost, however, as the flip side of being a legend is living up to your own hype.

In both cases, this Advancement increases the fighter\u2019s value by 5 credits.

Created using long-lost technologies, the STCs were given to colony ships during one of Mankind\u2019s earlier expansions across the stars. Encoded into the imperishable hardware of each machine were the blueprints for all manner of things the colonists might need, from power sources and habitats to armoured vehicles and weapons. In an age during which so much knowledge has been lost to the slow entropy of time, each STC represents a priceless artefact, and in the case of the Van Saar STC, a near infinite source of wealth.

More heavily armoured and equipped with an array of heavy weapons, Van Saar wasteland gangs and expeditions often use it in place of rigs and runners, especially when operating in dangerous or difficult environments. The Arachnika has proven its worth time and again against enemy vehicles and nomad war parties, the former often caught off-guard by its speed and the latter often unable to smash through its thick plating. Its heavy weaponry is more than the equal of enemy armour \u2013 lascannon blasting through the sides of Cargo-8s, plasma guns vaporising enemy fighters and flamers incinerating anything that strays too close. Even its harpoon launcher allows it to drag foes closer or plunder cargo with a well-placed shot, while its ability to take to the air on a plume of ash and flame as its jump boosters kick in, allows it to both leap free of trouble or drop into the midst of its foes unexpectedly. A favoured tactic of Arachnika pilots is to jump from cover up into the low choking cloud cover of the ash wastes, before descending without warning to either carve apart a vehicle with their guns or crush unwary fighters under its metal bulk, before leaping away again into the clouds.*\n    \n\n*Source: The Aranthian Succession: Ruins of Jardlan*\n\n*Source: The Aranthian Succession: Ruins of Jardlan*\n\n**75CREDITS**",

By the time a Van Saar clanner comes of age, their body will already be starting to fail them, kept alive only by the systems of their survival suits. As they age, or are wounded in the endless wars of the underhive, their body will degrade further, and only the intervention of augmetics can keep them going. Fortunately for a Van Saar ganger, access to the clan\u2019s Cyberteknika (as it is known within the Clan House) is plentiful, and a successful fighter can greatly extend their own life span, enhance their abilities and hide their inward degeneration through the use of masterfully wrought artificial skin and limbs.",

Once the fighter leaves Recovery, the effects of the Injury will have been replaced with the effects of the Cyberteknika.\n\nAlternatively, when a fighter gains a new advance, they may also replace any of their body parts with a piece of the Cyberteknika, paying the credits cost and going Into Recovery as above.\n\nFinally, Van Saar fighters with the Gang Hierarchy (X) special rule may be given Cyberteknika during gang creation at the cost listed as follows.",

These hulking machines are driven by the cranial remains of a Palanite Enforcer whose personality profile matches those prescribed for \u2018Sanctioner\u2019 use \u2212 the subject given extensive psycho-conditioning before their brain is removed, dissected and placed within the confines of the automata. Unlike the \u2018ambot\u2019, which is driven by the animal instincts and nervous system of an Ambul, the Sanctioner has a human mind controlling its actions\u2212 albeit one devoid of emotion and dedicated utterly to the letter of the law. For this reason, gangs often call these machines \u2018Lawtomata\u2019, saying you\u2019d find more mercy at the hands of a Corpse Grinder Cult than under the gaze of a Sanctioner.*\n\n*A Sanctioner is armed and armoured for the pacification tasks it is so often required to undertake. Heavy carapace plates protect the already robust inner workings of the Sanctioner, making them largely immune to small arms fire or the crude melee weapons often employed in uprisings or by outlaw gangers. Some Enforcer units, such as the Subjugators, often uparmour their automata further, to deal with more heavily armed resistance. Even discounting all their armour, Sanctioners have a reputation for being notoriously difficult to kill, the massive cybernetica rising again and again after taking punishing amounts of weapons fire as their internal repair systems keep them going.*\n\n*The hulking automata\u2019s arms incorporate weapons for both crowd control and gang warfare \u2212 one arm ending in a pacifier assault claw, known to criminals and gangs as the \u2018Fist of Dread\u2019 for the brutal damage it can inflict. Alternatively, it can replace the fist with a concussion cannon, an ideal weapon for stunning foes before hauling them off to the local Precinct-Fortress. Its other arm is equipped with a sanction pattern mancatcher to restrain and detain any who get in its way.*\n\n*A Sanctioner is able to engage targets at longer range using an integrated grenade launcher. Grenades are a favoured tool of the Enforcers because of the variety of situations they can deal with \u2212 and the Sanctioner is no different. Flash, choke, scare and stun grenades are all useful to break up crowds or take the fight out of criminals, while smoke grenades provide cover for advancing Enforcers.*\n\n*Sanctioners are usually only released from their storage chambers within a Precinct-Fortress in the case of large scale hive uprisings, though occasionally patrol sergeants might find themselves using them to bring law and order to especially wild regions of the underhive. In the wake of the Great Darkness, with loyalties divided and general unrest across all of Necromunda, more and more Sanctioners have been activated, while the number of \u2018volunteers\u2019 chosen to donate their brains to bolster the robot\u2019s ranks has increased tenfold.*",

Initially well-supplied and with a full complement of Enforcers, these lone beacons of order are them left to their own devices to maintain the Pax Helmawr as best they can.*\n\n*Isolated as they are, Badzone Precinct Captains must abandon many of the restrictions their fellow Enforcers operate under if they are to survive, often abolishing the delineation of their forces between Palanites and Subjugators and even deputising hive scum to bulk out their numbers. Occasionally, an especially promising scum even gets accepted within the Badzone Enforcers' ranks; after all, losses must be replaced somehow. In addition, with limited resupplies of armaments making it through to them, Badzone Enforcers must rely upon whatever they can seize from other badzone elements or trade for on the open markets, with the more specialist equipment ending up in the hands of the Captains and Sergeants alone.*\n\nThe following section, along with the Palanite Enforcers list, provide all the rules needed top run a Badzone Enforcers gang in your campaigns of Necromunda.",

A perfectly crafted organism, its sole purpose is to infiltrate and subvert the populations of entire worlds.*\n\n*Genestealer Cults are utterly loyal to their leaders in a way not even the word-keepers of House Cawdor could hope to impose. It is a link forged of genetics, a compulsion woven into each member\u2019s flesh, and thus utterly unbreakable. Without the direct influence of a brood lord, or the specialised mutations of the fourth generation, these splinter cults instead serve the strongest among their kind, often drawn from the first and second generation of their bloodline. These Cult Adept and Cult Alpha are far longer-lived than their heritage would suggest, as if their blood, mixed with that of the xenos, responds to the psychic needs of their family and so strengthens and elevates them. Under their sway hybrid Acolytes and Neophytes serve as foot soldiers, many passing for human, and even those who cannot are often mistaken for merely yet another of Necromunda\u2019s countless mutant inhabitants. Aberrants too can be found within the splinter cults, mistakes of biology, nonetheless given purpose in battle against the cult\u2019s enemies.*\n\n*Almost all splinter cults are grown from mining families, and even generations on they use this guise to exist unnoticed among a world of humans. Clad in hazard suits and armed with a variety of scavenged weapons, mostly mining tools, splinter cults can form formidable gangs, as even the most primitive of blades can prove deadly when wielded by the hand of those who believe so completely in their cause. Tragically though, at least for the cult, their lifecycle remains stunted. Perhaps because of their separation from their distant brood father, Purestrains remain denied to them. In all likelihood, however, true glory still slumbers within the flesh of the family\u2019s members and should the brood father ever call them to his side, they will continue their march towards the next stage of their deadly evolution.*\n\n*There is no way to tell how many of these splinter cults exist on Necromunda, cut off from the broodthing of Secundus, growing ever larger without any real goal save expanding their territories and extending their bloodline. A few though have made their mark, their names growing in the dark and cursed by their enemies, though still far beneath the notice of the Imperial House and its vast armies.*",

It is the great cycle of existence that rules over all who serve the Imperial House, the denizens of the hives either feeding on their predecessors, or feeding the living with their own dead flesh. Corpse Grinder Cults are a by-product of this brutal necessity, charged with the grim task of recycling their fellow hivers into corpse-starch. The Great Houses of Necromunda are intimately familiar with the Corpse Grinder Cults, for they are a plague that rises from within the mortuary combines and Corpse Guilds with regular frequency. Even in the unrelenting horror of the hive, those forced to recycle corpses sometimes rebel against reality, losing their sanity among the whirr of the meat-saw and wet crunch of the bone-grinders. Where once a creature of reason and temperance stood, now a hollow shell consumed by hunger remains \u2013 the perfect vessel for the corrupting touch of Chaos to infect.*\n\n*Corpse Grinder Cults often start within the hallowed ranks of the Corpse Guilds. From among the toiling workers a leader will arise. Whether these deranged individuals draw the gaze of the Blood God with their cannibal madness or if it is the influence of the Dark God who turns honest men to feast upon the cutting floor is unclear. The result, however, is the same. Over time, a cult leader will become stronger and more ravenous, the growling voice of Khorne driving them to murder so that they might feast upon warmand bloody flesh. Around these debased leaders, deviant cults are formed. Prospective followers might be drawn from within the mortuary manufactorums, or from the greater hive populace. At first trusted members are inducted, and offered a taste of the gory bounty smuggled out of production lines. Thus are entire families and hab communities corrupted, most knowing only that the meat gives them strength and endurance like nothing they have known, unaware of the dark blessing surrounding the cult leader.*",
